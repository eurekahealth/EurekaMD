3,"The patient had a history of recent surgery and sudden onset of shortness of breath followed by cardiac arrest, which is suggestive of a pulmonary embolism. The histological finding of fibrous connective tissue around the lumen of the pulmonary artery indicates organization of a thrombus. This is consistent with thromboembolism, where a thrombus (often from a deep vein thrombosis) travels to the pulmonary arteries and can lead to sudden respiratory distress and death. The fibrous tissue suggests that there was an attempt at organization of the thrombus, which is a common finding in thromboembolic disease.",9
10,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with Graves' disease, an autoimmune hyperthyroid condition. The ocular symptoms, such as diplopia, ocular pain, prominence of the globes, lid retraction, and inability to converge, suggest Graves' ophthalmopathy. This condition is caused by the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in the retro-orbital space, leading to inflammation and swelling of the extraocular muscles and other orbital tissues. This results in the characteristic eye findings, including proptosis and diplopia. The other options do not align with the typical pathophysiology of Graves' ophthalmopathy.",9
7,"The pleuroperitoneal membrane is involved in the development of the diaphragm. A defect in this membrane can lead to a congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), most commonly a Bochdalek hernia, which typically occurs on the left side. This defect allows abdominal contents to herniate into the thoracic cavity. The most common contents that herniate are the stomach and intestines. Therefore, the presence of the gastric fundus in the thorax is consistent with a diaphragmatic hernia due to a defect in the pleuroperitoneal membrane.",9
11,"The symptoms described in the vignette are consistent with infant botulism. The key features include weakness, bilateral ptosis, sluggish pupillary response, weak sucking and gag reflex, shallow respirations, drooling, and constipation. These symptoms are due to the blockade of acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, which is characteristic of botulism. The toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum inhibits the release of acetylcholine, leading to the flaccid paralysis observed in this patient. Therefore, the pathophysiology involves the blockade of presynaptic acetylcholine release.",9
4,"The patient presents with menorrhagia, easy bruising, and a family history of similar symptoms, suggesting a hereditary bleeding disorder. The laboratory tests show a normal platelet count and PT, but a prolonged PTT. Hemophilia A is characterized by a deficiency in factor VIII, leading to a prolonged PTT, but it typically presents with deep tissue bleeding rather than mucocutaneous bleeding like menorrhagia and easy bruising. Lupus anticoagulant is associated with a prolonged PTT but usually causes thrombosis rather than bleeding. Protein C deficiency leads to a hypercoagulable state, not bleeding. Von Willebrand disease is the most common hereditary bleeding disorder, characterized by mucocutaneous bleeding, a normal platelet count, and a prolonged PTT due to the role of von Willebrand factor in stabilizing factor VIII. The family history and symptomatology align with von Willebrand disease.",9
16,"The patient is a 76-year-old man presenting with urinary frequency, nocturia, post-void dribbling, and difficulty initiating urination. These symptoms are suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), especially given the enlarged, smooth, and non-tender prostate found on digital rectal exam. The patient's symptoms are consistent with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to BPH. 

Tamsulosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist that relaxes the smooth muscle in the bladder neck and prostate, improving urine flow and reducing BPH symptoms. This makes it the appropriate choice for managing his symptoms.

Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic, which would not address the urinary symptoms related to BPH and could potentially worsen nocturia. Midodrine is an alpha-1 agonist used for orthostatic hypotension, which could exacerbate urinary retention. Oxybutynin is an anticholinergic used for overactive bladder, which is not indicated here as the symptoms are due to BPH.

Therefore, the most appropriate medication for this patient is Tamsulosin.",10
17,"The patient's symptoms of nausea and abdominal discomfort, particularly after eating, along with symptoms during exertion (climbing stairs), suggest a possible cardiac origin, especially given his risk factors: type 2 diabetes, hypertension, obesity, smoking history, and peripheral arterial disease. These factors increase the likelihood of coronary artery disease, which can present with atypical symptoms such as gastrointestinal discomfort. The absence of abnormalities on the ECG does not rule out cardiac issues, as exertional symptoms could indicate ischemia not present at rest. Therefore, a cardiac stress test is the most appropriate next step to evaluate for coronary artery disease.",9
15,"The patient presents with sudden onset leg pain, cold and pale leg, diminished sensation, and weakness, which are classic signs of acute limb ischemia. This condition is often due to an embolus, especially in a patient with atrial fibrillation, which can lead to embolic events. The immediate management of acute limb ischemia involves anticoagulation to prevent further clot propagation. The best initial step is to start a heparin drip to anticoagulate the patient. Surgical thrombectomy or thrombolysis may be considered after anticoagulation, depending on the severity and duration of ischemia, but anticoagulation is the priority to stabilize the situation.",9
13,"The patient's symptoms and MRI findings suggest bilateral vestibular schwannomas, which are characteristic of Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2). Schwannomas are tumors of Schwann cells, which are derived from the neural crest. The presence of multiple soft, yellow plaques and papules could indicate other neural crest-derived tumors or lesions, consistent with NF2. Therefore, the abnormal cells in these masses are most likely derived from the neural crest.",9
20,"The patient presents with back pain, weakness in the lower extremities, hyporeflexia, and saddle anesthesia. These symptoms are indicative of cauda equina syndrome, which is a lower motor neuron lesion. The hyporeflexia and saddle anesthesia are classic signs. In cases of suspected cauda equina syndrome, immediate intervention is crucial to prevent permanent neurological damage. High-dose steroids are often administered to reduce inflammation and swelling, especially when there is a suspicion of metastatic disease causing compression. Steroids should be started prior to obtaining an MRI to quickly address any potential inflammation and compression.",9
26,"The clinical presentation involves a young girl with early onset of secondary sexual characteristics, specifically axillary and pubic hair, and an ovarian mass. The elevated estrogen levels suggest that the mass is hormonally active. Granulosa cell tumors are known to secrete estrogen, leading to precocious puberty in young girls. The presence of an ovarian mass and elevated estrogen levels strongly point towards a granulosa cell tumor. Idiopathic precocious puberty would not typically present with an ovarian mass. McCune-Albright syndrome involves multiple endocrine abnormalities and characteristic skin findings, which are not mentioned here. Sertoli-Leydig tumors typically produce androgens, not estrogens, and would not cause elevated estrogen levels.",9
19,"The patient's symptoms of jaundice and dark urine, along with elevated liver enzymes, suggest liver dysfunction. The key detail is the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining used in the liver biopsy. PAS staining is used to identify glycogen and other substances, but when combined with diastase digestion, it highlights alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency by showing PAS-positive, diastase-resistant globules in hepatocytes. This condition can lead to liver disease and is associated with pulmonary emphysema due to the lack of alpha-1 antitrypsin protection in the lungs. Therefore, the most likely additional finding in this patient, considering the liver biopsy findings, would be bullous changes of the lung bases on chest CT, indicative of emphysema.",9
27,"The scenario describes a 16-year-old boy who has undergone a significant change in behavior following a stressful family event (his father moving out after discovering his mother's affair). He has shifted from being a high-achieving, well-behaved student to engaging in aggressive and rebellious behaviors such as skipping classes, bullying, and smoking. This change in behavior is a response to the emotional turmoil he is experiencing due to the family situation. 

The defense mechanism that best describes this behavior is ""acting out."" Acting out involves expressing unconscious emotional conflicts or feelings through actions rather than words. In this case, the boy is likely expressing his distress and anger about the family situation through his disruptive and aggressive behaviors. 

Other options like projection, passive aggression, and regression do not fit as well:
- Projection involves attributing one's own unacceptable thoughts or feelings to others.
- Passive aggression involves indirect expression of hostility.
- Regression involves reverting to an earlier stage of development.

Therefore, the best explanation for his behavior is acting out.",9
28,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a cranial nerve III palsy, characterized by ptosis, a dilated pupil, and double vision. The poorly reactive, dilated pupil indicates that the parasympathetic fibers of the oculomotor nerve are affected, which is concerning for a compressive lesion, such as an aneurysm. Given the acute presentation and the pupil involvement, the most appropriate next step is to evaluate for a possible posterior communicating artery aneurysm. MR angiography of the head is the best test to visualize cerebral vasculature and identify any aneurysms.",9
29,"The scenario describes a process where a chemically-tagged protein attaches to lysine residues on a polypeptide, and then a barrel-shaped complex degrades the polypeptide into amino acids. This is characteristic of ubiquitination, where ubiquitin, a small protein, is covalently attached to lysine residues on target proteins. The ubiquitinated proteins are then recognized and degraded by the proteasome, a barrel-shaped complex, into peptides and amino acids. Glycosylation, phosphorylation, and carboxylation do not involve degradation by a proteasome.",9
39,"During male embryonic development, the Sertoli cells produce Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH), also known as Müllerian Inhibiting Substance (MIS). This hormone is responsible for the regression of the Müllerian ducts, which would otherwise develop into female internal genitalia such as the uterus, fallopian tubes, and the upper part of the vagina. The other options do not play a role in the inhibition of female internal genitalia: Spermatogonia are involved in sperm production, the Allantois is involved in early fluid exchange between the embryo and the yolk sac, and the Syncytiotrophoblast is involved in implantation and hormone production during pregnancy.",9
42,"The child has a history of recurrent infections with encapsulated bacteria, such as Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae, which suggests a possible complement deficiency. The presence of petechiae and the positive culture for N. meningitidis indicate a likely deficiency in the terminal complement pathway, specifically the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which is composed of C5b-C9. This deficiency would impair the ability to form the C5-9 complex, leading to increased susceptibility to infections with Neisseria species. The other options relate to T-cell function and early complement pathway components, which are less likely given the clinical presentation and history.",9
32,"The patient's symptoms of hematuria, lower abdominal pain, urinary frequency, and urgency are suggestive of hemorrhagic cystitis. This condition is a known side effect of cyclophosphamide, a chemotherapeutic agent. Cyclophosphamide is metabolized into acrolein, a toxic metabolite that can irritate the bladder lining and cause hemorrhagic cystitis. Methotrexate, rituximab, and prednisone do not typically cause these urinary symptoms. Methotrexate is an antimetabolite, rituximab is a monoclonal antibody, and prednisone is a corticosteroid, none of which are associated with hemorrhagic cystitis.",9
44,"During the hemithyroidectomy, the structure damaged is likely the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve, which runs close to the superior thyroid artery. This nerve innervates the cricothyroid muscle, which is responsible for tensing the vocal cords and modulating pitch. Damage to this nerve can lead to difficulty in reaching high-pitched sounds, resulting in voice pitch limitation.",9
49,"The patient is experiencing a miscarriage at 10 weeks gestation, characterized by vaginal bleeding, passage of clots, and an open cervical os with products of conception visible. In the first trimester, the most common cause of spontaneous abortion is chromosomal abnormalities, accounting for about 50% of cases. Rh immunization is unlikely to cause a miscarriage at this early stage. Antiphospholipid syndrome can cause recurrent miscarriages but is less common as a cause of a single early miscarriage. Trauma is also an unlikely cause in this scenario. Given the gestational age and presentation, chromosomal abnormalities are the most probable cause.",9
47,"The patient's presentation is consistent with a thyroglossal duct cyst. These cysts are typically midline neck masses that can move with swallowing or tongue protrusion, as they are connected to the tongue via the thyroglossal duct. The location above the hyoid bone and the fact that the mass is fluctuant and minimally mobile further support this diagnosis. Thyroglossal duct cysts result from the failure of the thyroglossal duct to completely obliterate during development, leading to cyst formation. The normal thyroid function tests and absence of systemic symptoms also align with this diagnosis. Other options, such as persistent thyroid tissue at the tongue base or deletion of the 22q11 gene, do not match the clinical presentation as closely as a thyroglossal duct cyst.",9
53,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest rabies encephalitis, likely due to exposure to bats. Rabies is a viral infection that can be prevented by post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), which includes both rabies immunoglobulin (the injection shortly after exposure) and a series of rabies vaccinations. The most effective treatment after potential exposure to rabies is the administration of a killed rabies vaccine, which should be given as soon as possible, ideally within ten days of exposure, to prevent the onset of symptoms. Once symptoms appear, rabies is almost universally fatal, so timely vaccination is crucial.",9
51,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest peripheral artery disease (PAD), characterized by claudication and rest pain due to reduced blood flow to the limbs. The atrophied leg and loss of hair indicate chronic ischemia. His risk factors include diabetes, hypertension, and smoking, which contribute to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis involves the narrowing and calcification of vessels due to plaque buildup, leading to reduced blood flow. This matches the patient's presentation of pain during exertion and at rest, as well as the physical findings. Other options like decreased permeability, emboli, or vessel wall weakening do not align as closely with the chronic ischemic changes seen here.",9
50,"The symptoms presented in the case include fussiness, poor feeding, abdominal distension, and tympany in the left lower quadrant. These symptoms suggest a gastrointestinal issue. The key detail is the suspicion of a condition caused by the failure of specialized cells to migrate. Hirschsprung disease is caused by the failure of neural crest cells to migrate to the distal colon, resulting in a lack of ganglion cells (aganglionosis) in the bowel. This leads to a functional obstruction and symptoms such as abdominal distension and constipation. The other options do not fit the description as well: Meckel diverticulum is a remnant of the vitelline duct, DiGeorge syndrome involves failure of development of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches, and duodenal atresia is due to failure of recanalization of the duodenum, not cell migration. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Hirschsprung disease.",9
55,"The clinical presentation of the newborn includes vomiting, hyperventilation, lethargy, seizures, hyperammonemia, elevated glutamine levels, decreased blood urea nitrogen, and cerebral edema. These symptoms are indicative of a urea cycle disorder, which leads to the accumulation of ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia). The urea cycle is responsible for converting ammonia into urea for excretion. A defect in any enzyme of the urea cycle can lead to hyperammonemia. 

Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS I) is the first enzyme in the urea cycle and is responsible for converting ammonia and bicarbonate into carbamoyl phosphate. A deficiency in CPS I would lead to the accumulation of ammonia, as seen in this patient. The other enzymes listed are involved in different metabolic pathways: 

- Phenylalanine hydroxylase is involved in the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine.
- Branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase is involved in the metabolism of branched-chain amino acids.
- Cystathionine synthase is involved in the conversion of homocysteine to cystathionine.

Therefore, the enzyme defect that would result in a similar clinical presentation is in the urea cycle, specifically carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I.",9
56,"The patient presents with skin-colored papules with a dimpled center, which are characteristic of molluscum contagiosum. This condition is caused by a poxvirus. The presence of cervical lymphadenopathy and the patient's HIV status with a CD4+ count of 312/mm3 suggest an opportunistic infection, which is consistent with molluscum contagiosum in immunocompromised individuals. The other options do not match the clinical presentation: Bartonella is associated with bacillary angiomatosis, papillomavirus with warts, and Coccidioides with respiratory symptoms and systemic fungal infection.",9
60,"To calculate the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV), we need to set up a 2x2 table based on the information provided:

- True Positives (TP): 200 patients tested positive on both the screening test and the ophthalmologist exam.
- False Positives (FP): 250 - 200 = 50 patients tested positive on the screening test but negative on the ophthalmologist exam.
- False Negatives (FN): 10 patients tested negative on the screening test but positive on the ophthalmologist exam.
- True Negatives (TN): Total patients - (TP + FP + FN) = 500 - (200 + 50 + 10) = 240 patients tested negative on both tests.

Now, we calculate:

- Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN) = 200 / (200 + 10) = 200 / 210 = 0.952 or 95%
- Specificity = TN / (TN + FP) = 240 / (240 + 50) = 240 / 290 = 0.827 or 83%
- PPV = TP / (TP + FP) = 200 / (200 + 50) = 200 / 250 = 0.8 or 80%
- NPV = TN / (TN + FN) = 240 / (240 + 10) = 240 / 250 = 0.96 or 96%

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Sensitivity = 95%, Specificity = 83%, PPV = 80%, NPV = 96%.",9
68,"The infant presents with a continuous murmur best heard at the left infraclavicular area, which is characteristic of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The infant was born at 36 weeks' gestation, making her a late preterm infant. In preterm infants, a PDA can often be managed medically before considering surgical options. Indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is commonly used to promote closure of a PDA in preterm infants. Prostaglandin E1 is used to keep the ductus arteriosus open, which is not needed here. Surgical ligation and percutaneous surgery are typically considered if medical management fails. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to attempt closure with indomethacin.",9
73,"The patient is at 32 weeks' gestation and presents with premature rupture of membranes (PROM), as indicated by the sudden leakage of clear vaginal fluid and positive Nitrazine test. The fetal heart rate is reactive, and there are no signs of fetal distress or infection. Indomethacin is started to manage preterm labor. The goal is to prolong the pregnancy to allow for fetal lung maturity while preventing infection. Administering betamethasone is appropriate to accelerate fetal lung maturity, and ampicillin is given to prevent infection (Group B Streptococcus prophylaxis). There is no immediate indication for cesarean section or induction of labor unless there are signs of fetal distress or infection, which are not present here. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to administer betamethasone and ampicillin.",9
77,"The infant is in shock, likely due to dehydration and possibly sepsis, given the high fever and poor perfusion signs. Immediate vascular access is crucial for fluid resuscitation and administration of medications. Peripheral IV access has failed, and in emergency situations, intraosseous (IO) access is the preferred method for rapid vascular access in infants and young children when peripheral access is not achievable. IO access can be established quickly and is effective for fluid and medication administration. Other options like internal jugular vein cannulation or ultrasound-guided cannulation are more time-consuming and technically challenging in this urgent scenario. Intramuscular epinephrine is not appropriate here as the primary issue is fluid resuscitation, not anaphylaxis or cardiac arrest.",9
74,"The clinical presentation of the patient includes hyperthermia, hypertension, tachycardia, and muscle rigidity without tremor or clonus. These symptoms are suggestive of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), a life-threatening condition often associated with the use of antipsychotic medications. NMS is characterized by hyperthermia, autonomic dysregulation, altered mental status, and muscle rigidity. The treatment of choice for NMS is dantrolene, a muscle relaxant that helps reduce muscle rigidity and hyperthermia. Other options like naloxone are used for opioid overdose, fenoldopam for hypertensive emergencies, and cyproheptadine for serotonin syndrome, none of which match the symptom profile as closely as dantrolene does for NMS.",9
79,"In patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV congestive heart failure, improving survival is a key goal of treatment. Among the medications listed, spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist that has been shown to improve survival in patients with severe heart failure. The RALES (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study) trial demonstrated that spironolactone significantly reduces mortality in patients with severe heart failure. Amiloride is a potassium-sparing diuretic but does not have the same survival benefit as spironolactone. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic primarily used for hypertension and mild fluid retention, and it does not have a proven survival benefit in severe heart failure. Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor used for different indications, such as glaucoma and altitude sickness, and is not relevant for improving survival in heart failure.",9
70,"The patient has Barrett's esophagus, characterized by the presence of columnar epithelium with goblet cells in the distal esophagus, a result of metaplasia due to chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Metaplasia is the process where one type of differentiated cell changes to another type, often as an adaptive response to chronic irritation or inflammation.

The question asks for another example of metaplasia. 

- **A. Squamous epithelium in the bladder**: This is an example of squamous metaplasia, where transitional epithelium changes to squamous epithelium, often due to chronic irritation, such as from a urinary catheter or infection.

- **B. Paneth cells in the duodenum**: Paneth cells are normally present in the small intestine, so this is not an example of metaplasia.

- **C. Branching muscularis mucosa in the jejunum**: This is not related to metaplasia.

- **D. Disorganized squamous epithelium in the endocervix**: This represents squamous metaplasia, where the columnar epithelium of the endocervix changes to squamous epithelium, often due to chronic irritation or hormonal changes.

Both options A and D describe metaplasia, but the question is likely referring to the more classic example of metaplasia in response to chronic irritation, which is option A.",9
80,"The newborn is presenting with signs of cyanosis and differential oxygen saturation between the right hand and left foot, indicating a possible congenital heart defect with ductal-dependent circulation. The echocardiography finding of pulmonary and systemic circulation being in parallel suggests a condition like transposition of the great arteries (TGA), where the systemic and pulmonary circuits are not connected in series. In such cases, maintaining ductal patency is crucial to allow mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood to improve systemic oxygenation. Alprostadil (prostaglandin E1) is used to keep the ductus arteriosus open, which is essential in ductal-dependent congenital heart defects like TGA. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is Alprostadil.",9
83,"The patient presents with hypertension and an abdominal bruit, which raises suspicion for renal artery stenosis. Her current medications include lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, which is used to manage hypertension. However, the presence of an abdominal bruit suggests a possible vascular cause for her hypertension, such as renal artery stenosis. In such cases, imaging to assess the renal arteries is warranted. An ultrasound with Doppler can help evaluate blood flow in the renal arteries and confirm the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis. Increasing the dose of lisinopril or adding furosemide would not address the underlying cause if renal artery stenosis is present. Therefore, the best next step is to perform an ultrasound with Doppler to investigate the cause of the hypertension further.",9
78,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which is common in children with new-onset type 1 diabetes. The symptoms include polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, abdominal pain, and lethargy. The laboratory findings show metabolic acidosis (low HCO3-) with an elevated anion gap, hyperkalemia, and ketonuria. In DKA, there is a total body deficit of potassium despite the serum hyperkalemia due to the shift of potassium from the intracellular to the extracellular space caused by acidosis and insulin deficiency. Therefore, further evaluation is most likely to reveal decreased total body potassium.",9
88,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are suggestive of trichomoniasis. The key features include a thin, yellow, frothy vaginal discharge with a musty odor and punctate red maculae on the ectocervix, often referred to as ""strawberry cervix."" These findings are characteristic of an infection caused by Trichomonas vaginalis. On wet mount microscopy, Trichomonas vaginalis appears as motile, round or oval-shaped microorganisms. This distinguishes it from other causes of vaginal discharge such as bacterial vaginosis (which would show clue cells) or candidiasis (which would show budding yeast cells or pseudohyphae).",9
84,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with acute hepatitis. The elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) suggest significant liver inflammation or damage. The serology indicates an acute hepatitis B infection, as evidenced by the presence of hepatitis B core IgM antibody and the absence of hepatitis B surface antigen and antibody. The hepatitis C antibody is positive, but the RNA is negative, indicating a past infection or resolved infection, not an active one. In acute hepatitis B, the primary treatment is supportive care, as most patients will recover spontaneously without the need for antiviral therapy. Emergency liver transplantation is reserved for cases of fulminant hepatic failure, which is not indicated here based on the information provided. Ribavirin and interferon, as well as pegylated interferon-alpha, are not appropriate for acute hepatitis B. Therefore, the best course of action is supportive therapy.",9
89,"The patient is experiencing generalized reddening of the skin and itching, which are common side effects of niacin therapy, known as niacin flush. This occurs due to prostaglandin-mediated vasodilation. The symptoms are occurring in the evening, likely after taking niacin. The most appropriate management for niacin flush is to administer a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) like ibuprofen before taking niacin to reduce the flushing by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis.",9
86,"The patient presents with symptoms of hypocalcemia, such as numbness around the lips and tingling in the hands and feet, following a near-total thyroidectomy. The blood test confirms hypocalcemia with a serum calcium level of 6.0 mg/dL. The Trousseau's sign, demonstrated by the carpopedal spasm when the blood pressure cuff is inflated, further supports this. After thyroidectomy, hypocalcemia is often due to hypoparathyroidism, which can occur if the parathyroid glands are damaged or removed during surgery. The next best step is to confirm the cause of hypocalcemia by checking the serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. A low PTH level would confirm hypoparathyroidism as the cause of the hypocalcemia.",9
95,"The patient presents with symptoms and urinalysis findings suggestive of a nephritic syndrome, likely due to lupus nephritis given her history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The presence of dysmorphic RBCs and RBC casts indicates glomerular damage, which is consistent with nephritic syndrome. In nephritic syndrome, there is often hypertension and edema due to salt and water retention, rather than significant protein loss (as seen in nephrotic syndrome). The blood pressure is elevated, and there is bilateral pretibial edema, which supports the idea of salt retention as the cause of the edema. The proteinuria is mild (1+), which is not enough to cause significant edema through protein loss alone. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's leg findings (edema) is salt retention due to the nephritic process.",9
98,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest hemolytic anemia, likely due to oxidative stress on red blood cells. The presence of bite cells on the peripheral smear is indicative of G6PD deficiency, where red blood cells are more susceptible to oxidative damage. Certain drugs can precipitate hemolysis in individuals with G6PD deficiency. Primaquine is an antimalarial drug known to cause hemolysis in G6PD-deficient individuals. The other drugs listed are less likely to cause this specific reaction. Dapsone can also cause hemolysis in G6PD deficiency, but it is not typically used for malaria prophylaxis. Ivermectin and doxycycline are not associated with this type of hemolytic anemia in G6PD deficiency. Therefore, the most likely drug causing these symptoms in the context of malaria prophylaxis is primaquine.",9
97,"The patient presents with a post-menopausal vaginal mass and a history of HPV infection and smoking, both of which are risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma. The mass is described as an erythematous exophytic lesion with ulceration, which is characteristic of squamous cell carcinoma. Basal cell carcinoma is rare in the vagina and more common on sun-exposed skin. Melanoma is possible but less common than squamous cell carcinoma in the vagina. Sarcoma botryoides is a type of rhabdomyosarcoma seen in children, not in a 57-year-old woman. Given the patient's history and the characteristics of the mass, squamous cell carcinoma is the most likely diagnosis.",9
90,"The patient presents with signs of a severe postoperative infection following knee arthroplasty, characterized by erythema, swelling, tenderness, and a yellow-green discharge. The presence of blackening of the skin suggests necrotizing fasciitis or a similar severe soft tissue infection. In such cases, immediate surgical intervention is crucial to remove necrotic tissue and control the spread of infection. Antibiotic therapy alone would not be sufficient to address the necrotic tissue, and antiseptic dressing would not be adequate for such a severe infection. Removal of prostheses might be considered later if the infection involves the prosthetic joint, but the immediate priority is to control the soft tissue infection. Therefore, the next best step is surgical debridement.",9
104,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of a dermatophyte infection, commonly known as ringworm, which is characterized by an erythematous, scaly plaque with central clearing. This is a common condition among athletes, especially wrestlers, due to close skin contact. To confirm a dermatophyte infection, a KOH preparation is the most appropriate diagnostic test. This involves scraping the affected skin and applying potassium hydroxide to dissolve keratin and allow visualization of fungal elements under a microscope.",9
99,"To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV), we need to determine the proportion of true negatives out of all negative test results. 

First, identify the true negatives and false negatives:
- True negatives (TN): Patients without AIDS who tested negative. From the control group of 250 patients without AIDS, 5 tested positive, so 245 tested negative.
- False negatives (FN): Patients with AIDS who tested negative. From the 250 patients with AIDS, 240 tested positive, so 10 tested negative.

Next, calculate the total number of negative test results:
- Total negative test results = TN + FN = 245 + 10 = 255.

Finally, calculate the NPV:
- NPV = TN / (TN + FN) = 245 / 255.

The correct answer is option A: 245 / (245 + 10).",10
107,"The newborn in this scenario presents with features suggestive of DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome), which includes thymic hypoplasia, facial dysmorphisms (low-set ears, orbital hypertelorism, cleft palate), and congenital heart defects (such as truncus arteriosus, indicated by the single vessel from both ventricles). A common complication in DiGeorge syndrome is hypocalcemia due to parathyroid gland hypoplasia, which can lead to neuromuscular irritability, including tetany and seizures. Therefore, the patient should be urgently evaluated for hypocalcemia, which corresponds to neuromuscular irritability.",9
108,"The patient's symptoms and signs are suggestive of hyperthyroidism, likely Graves' disease, given the presence of eyelid retraction and other systemic symptoms such as tremor, palpitations, and warm extremities. The irregularly irregular pulse indicates atrial fibrillation, which can occur in hyperthyroidism. In the acute management of hyperthyroid symptoms, especially when there is tachycardia and tremor, a beta-blocker like propranolol is used to provide symptomatic relief. While methimazole or propylthiouracil would address the underlying hyperthyroidism, propranolol is the most appropriate immediate step to control the cardiovascular symptoms.",9
117,"The question asks which fact about the neoplasm is currently available to the physician based on the information provided. Grading of a tumor involves assessing the appearance of the cancer cells and how much they differ from normal cells, often focusing on nuclear atypia and mitotic activity. Staging, on the other hand, involves determining the extent of cancer spread, including lymph node involvement and distant metastasis.

Option A, ""The tumor cells exhibit marked nuclear atypia,"" relates to the grading of the tumor, as it describes the cellular characteristics. This information can be obtained from the biopsy and is available to the physician.

Options B, C, and D all relate to staging, which involves assessing the spread of the tumor to lymph nodes or other parts of the body. These details are not available from the current diagnostic information, as staging requires additional imaging or surgical evaluation to determine the extent of spread.

Therefore, the only fact currently available to the physician is related to the grading of the tumor, which is option A.",9
115,"The patient presents with fatigue, flank pain, fever, elevated serum urea and creatinine, and leukocyturia with negative urine culture. The key finding is the presence of eosinophils in the urine, as revealed by the Hansel's stain. This combination of symptoms and laboratory findings is highly suggestive of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), which is often caused by a hypersensitivity reaction to medications such as antibiotics. The recent use of amoxicillin and cephalexin, both of which can cause AIN, supports this diagnosis. The absence of bacteria in the urine culture rules out a bacterial infection, and the presence of eosinophils is not typical for the other listed conditions.",9
120,"The patient's symptoms and smoking history are concerning for lung cancer, particularly given the hemoptysis, weight loss, and night sweats. The chest X-ray shows a central nodule in the hilar region, which is suspicious for a malignancy such as small cell lung cancer or squamous cell carcinoma, both of which are associated with smoking and often present centrally. 

In this scenario, the next best step is to obtain a tissue diagnosis to confirm the type of cancer and guide treatment. Mediastinoscopy is a procedure that allows for biopsy of mediastinal lymph nodes and can help in staging and diagnosis of central lung lesions. This is crucial before initiating any treatment like chemotherapy or radiotherapy. 

Repeat surveillance is not appropriate given the high suspicion of malignancy and the patient's symptoms. Therefore, the next best step is to perform a mediastinoscopy to obtain a definitive diagnosis.",9
127,"The patient was found unresponsive with shallow respirations and constricted pupils, which are classic signs of opioid intoxication. The administration of naloxone, an opioid antagonist, resulted in the patient becoming fully conscious and alert, indicating that the respiratory depression was due to opioid intoxication. While hypoglycemia was present, it was corrected with dextrose, and the rapid improvement after naloxone suggests opioids were the primary cause. Alcohol intoxication could cause respiratory depression, but the immediate response to naloxone points to opioids. Hallucinogens typically do not cause respiratory depression.",9
123,"The patient presents with knee pain that started after repetitive pivoting and twisting, which is common in sports like volleyball. The pain is localized to the medial aspect of the tibia just below the patella. This location is consistent with the pes anserine bursa, which is located on the medial side of the knee below the joint line. Pes anserine bursitis is common in individuals who are obese and those who have recently increased their physical activity, both of which apply to this patient. The other options are less likely: a medial collateral ligament tear would typically present with instability and pain along the joint line; a medial meniscus tear would often present with joint line tenderness and possibly locking or clicking; patellofemoral syndrome usually presents with anterior knee pain, particularly with activities like climbing stairs or sitting for long periods. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is pes anserine bursitis.",9
129,"The patient has likely overdosed on clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). The symptoms and signs are consistent with TCA overdose: anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, urinary retention), CNS depression (unresponsiveness), and cardiovascular effects (tachycardia, hypotension, and widened QRS on ECG). The widened QRS complex is particularly concerning as it indicates sodium channel blockade, which can lead to arrhythmias. The best treatment for TCA overdose with QRS widening is sodium bicarbonate, which helps to stabilize the cardiac membrane and narrow the QRS complex.",9
131,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with urge incontinence, characterized by a sudden, intense urge to urinate followed by involuntary loss of urine. This condition is often due to overactivity of the detrusor muscle, which is responsible for bladder contractions. The negative Q-tip test and normal postvoid residual urine suggest that stress incontinence and overflow incontinence are unlikely. The patient's history of diabetes and caffeine intake can contribute to detrusor overactivity. Therefore, the underlying cause of her urinary incontinence is increased detrusor muscle activity.",9
133,"The patient experienced a loss of consciousness immediately after micturition, which is a classic scenario for situational syncope. Situational syncope is a type of reflex syncope that occurs in specific situations that lead to a reflex-mediated drop in heart rate and/or blood pressure. Common triggers include micturition, defecation, coughing, and swallowing. The fact that the patient regained consciousness quickly and had no focal neurological deficits or abnormalities on examination or ECG further supports a benign cause like situational syncope. Emotional syncope typically involves a strong emotional trigger, neurocardiogenic syncope is often related to prolonged standing or stress, and arrhythmogenic syncope would likely show ECG changes or have a history of cardiac issues.",9
138,"The patient presents with symptoms and risk factors suggestive of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), including recent long-distance travel, leg swelling, erythema, and dilated superficial veins. The ultrasound finding of non-compressibility of the vein is indicative of a thrombus. DVT is caused by impaired venous blood flow due to the formation of a thrombus within the deep veins, often exacerbated by prolonged immobility, as seen in long flights. This mechanism aligns with option A.",9
136,"The patient's presentation includes a rapidly enlarging breast mass that is multinodular and nontender, with no skin or nipple changes and no lymphadenopathy. The mammography shows a smooth polylobulated mass. These characteristics suggest a tumor that is likely benign but can grow rapidly. Comedocarcinoma and invasive ductal carcinoma are types of breast cancer that typically present with more aggressive features and may show skin or nipple changes, as well as lymphadenopathy. Fibroadenomas are benign breast tumors that are usually smaller and do not grow rapidly. Phyllodes tumors, on the other hand, are known for their rapid growth and can present as large, smooth, lobulated masses. The biopsy image, although not visible here, would likely show stromal overgrowth typical of a Phyllodes tumor. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a Phyllodes tumor.",9
147,"The patient presents with flank pain, rash, hematuria, and acute kidney injury (elevated creatinine) after starting hydrochlorothiazide. These symptoms, along with the maculopapular rash, suggest acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), which is often caused by medications such as antibiotics, NSAIDs, and diuretics like hydrochlorothiazide. AIN is characterized by inflammation of the renal interstitium and is often associated with the presence of eosinophils in the urine. The other options do not fit the clinical picture: dermal IgA deposition is associated with Henoch-Schönlein purpura, crescentic proliferation is seen in rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, and mesangial IgA deposits are characteristic of IgA nephropathy. Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient is urinary eosinophils, indicative of AIN.",9
150,"The scenario describes a situation where two different strains of herpes simplex virus are introduced into a human epithelial cell, and the progeny viruses have phenotypes distinct from the parent strains. Additionally, sequencing shows that the progeny genomes contain material from both parent strains. This indicates that there has been an exchange of genetic material between the two viral genomes, resulting in new combinations of genetic material in the progeny. This process is best explained by recombination, which involves the exchange of genetic material between different viral genomes, leading to progeny with mixed genetic material from both parents.",9
143,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of infective endocarditis, including fatigue, shortness of breath, low-grade fevers, night sweats, and the presence of subungual hemorrhages and Osler nodes. He has a history of a bicuspid aortic valve, which is a risk factor for endocarditis. The systolic murmur indicates aortic valve involvement. The most common organisms causing endocarditis in patients with pre-existing valvular abnormalities are the viridans group streptococci, particularly Streptococcus sanguinis, which is part of the normal oral flora and can enter the bloodstream during dental procedures or with poor oral hygiene. Staphylococcus epidermidis is more commonly associated with prosthetic valve endocarditis, Streptococcus pneumoniae is associated with pneumonia and meningitis, and Streptococcus pyogenes is associated with pharyngitis and skin infections. Therefore, the most likely causal organism in this case is Streptococcus sanguinis.",9
155,"The patient is experiencing symptoms of hypocalcemia, which is common after thyroidectomy due to potential damage or removal of the parathyroid glands. The tingling sensation in the fingertips and around the mouth, along with the muscle spasm observed during blood pressure measurement (Trousseau's sign), are indicative of low calcium levels. The next best step in management is to address the hypocalcemia by providing calcium replacement.",9
118,"The patient has signs of possible internal abdominal injury, suggested by severe abdominal pain, rigidity, and tenderness, along with signs of potential hypovolemic shock (cold extremities, low CVP). In the context of trauma, an immediate evaluation to determine the presence of intra-abdominal bleeding or injury is crucial. 

A diagnostic laparotomy is invasive and typically reserved for when there is clear evidence of need for surgical intervention or when other diagnostic measures are unavailable or inconclusive. 

A CT scan provides detailed images and can identify injuries such as organ lacerations or bleeding, but it may not be as immediately available and requires the patient to be stable enough to be transported to the scanner. 

Peritoneal lavage is an older method for detecting intra-abdominal bleeding and is less commonly used now due to the availability of non-invasive methods.

Ultrasound, particularly the FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma) exam, is a rapid, non-invasive, bedside procedure that can quickly evaluate for free fluid in the abdomen, suggesting hemorrhage. It is especially useful in unstable patients where time is critical.

Given the scenario, ultrasound is the best initial step for the rapid evaluation of potential internal bleeding in a trauma setting.",9
160,"The patient presents with fever, jaundice, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, and elevated liver enzymes, which are suggestive of a hepatobiliary issue. The fever and leukocytosis indicate an inflammatory or infectious process. The jaundice and elevated bilirubin levels, along with the right upper quadrant tenderness, point towards a gallbladder or biliary tract problem. Acalculous cholecystitis is a condition that can occur in critically ill patients, often those who are postoperative or have been on parenteral nutrition, and it presents with similar symptoms. The absence of gallstones (acalculous) is common in such cases. The other options are less likely: small bowel obstruction would present with different symptoms, acute pancreatitis would typically show elevated amylase and lipase, and a hemolytic transfusion reaction would have occurred closer to the time of transfusion and would present with different laboratory findings.",9
166,"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of aortic stenosis. The key features include exertional dyspnea, syncope, and a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur at the right second intercostal space, which is characteristic of aortic stenosis. The ECG finding of left ventricular hypertrophy further supports this diagnosis, as it can occur due to the increased afterload from the stenotic aortic valve. 

To confirm the diagnosis of aortic stenosis and assess the severity, the best next step is to perform a transthoracic echocardiography. This non-invasive test will provide information on the valve anatomy, the degree of stenosis, and the impact on cardiac function, which are crucial for management decisions.",9
157,"The boy's symptoms suggest a peripheral neuropathy, likely due to a post-viral syndrome such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. The weakness is primarily in foot dorsiflexion, indicating involvement of the common peroneal nerve, which affects the anterior compartment of the leg. The common peroneal nerve provides sensation to the first dorsal webspace of the foot. Therefore, diminished sensation would most likely be in this area.",9
161,"The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, carotid stenosis, and mild dementia. His neurological examination reveals absent ankle jerk and patellar reflexes, which could be due to age-related changes or peripheral neuropathy. However, his sensation and muscle strength are intact, and he has mild memory impairment, which is consistent with his known mild dementia. The absent reflexes in the elderly can be a normal finding, especially in the context of peripheral vascular disease. There is no indication of acute neurological issues or symptoms suggestive of Parkinson's disease, such as tremor or bradykinesia, which would warrant carbidopa-levodopa. Thiamine deficiency is unlikely given the absence of symptoms like ataxia or confusion. A lumbar puncture is not indicated without signs of infection or other acute neurological changes. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to recognize these findings as consistent with his age and known conditions, requiring no further immediate workup.",9
167,"The patient's symptoms and the presence of a retroperitoneal mass suggest a pheochromocytoma, a tumor that secretes catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine). These catecholamines increase sympathetic nervous system activity, leading to symptoms such as headaches, palpitations, sweating, and hypertension. The increased heart rate (tachycardia) is primarily due to the action of catecholamines on the heart. 

Catecholamines increase heart rate by acting on beta-adrenergic receptors, which leads to increased activity of hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, also known as ""funny"" channels. These channels are responsible for the pacemaker current (I_f) in the sinoatrial node of the heart, which controls the heart rate. Activation of these channels increases the slope of phase 4 depolarization, leading to an increased heart rate.

Therefore, the increased heart rate in this patient is most likely due to increased activity of hyperpolarization-activated, nucleotide-gated channels.",9
168,"The patient presents with fever, uterine tenderness, and tachycardia on post-operative day 2 after a vaginal delivery of a large baby. These symptoms are suggestive of an infection. The key symptom here is uterine tenderness, which is highly indicative of endometritis, an infection of the uterine lining that can occur postpartum. The frequent urination could be due to postpartum diuresis, which is common after delivery. The presence of minor bibasilar crackles is not specific and could be due to atelectasis, but the primary concern here is the uterine tenderness and fever. Chorioamnionitis is an infection of the fetal membranes and amniotic fluid, typically occurring before delivery, not after. Deep vein thrombosis would present with leg swelling and pain, not uterine tenderness. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is endometritis.",9
170,"The patient is an elderly woman experiencing changes in her sleep pattern, which is common with aging. She has difficulty falling asleep, wakes up earlier, and has fragmented sleep. Despite these issues, she manages to get 5-6 hours of sleep per night and feels only mildly tired in the afternoon without taking naps. Her lifestyle is healthy, and she does not have habits that typically disrupt sleep, such as smoking or alcohol use. Her mental status exam shows mild anxiety, but no severe mood disorder. Given her age and the nature of her sleep complaints, reassurance is often the most appropriate initial management step. This approach acknowledges the normal changes in sleep patterns with aging and encourages maintaining good sleep hygiene. Other options like sleep restriction or medications are not first-line treatments in this scenario, especially without more severe symptoms or functional impairment.",9
181,"The newborn has a complete absence of the thyroid gland, yet shows normal physical examination findings. This suggests that the newborn is not currently experiencing symptoms of hypothyroidism. In utero, the fetus relies on maternal thyroid hormones, particularly thyroxine (T4), which can cross the placenta. This transplacental transmission of thyroxine provides the necessary thyroid hormone to the fetus, allowing for normal development and function despite the absence of the fetal thyroid gland. This explains the normal physical examination findings at birth.",9
183,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The key features include fever, neurological symptoms (tingling sensation, numbness, confusion), renal impairment (elevated creatinine), microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (evidenced by fragmented erythrocytes on the blood smear), and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count). TTP is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme ADAMTS13, which is responsible for cleaving von Willebrand factor multimers. This deficiency is often due to the presence of antibodies against ADAMTS13, leading to the accumulation of large von Willebrand factor multimers that cause platelet aggregation and microvascular thrombosis. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is antibodies against ADAMTS13.",10
187,"The patient presents with acute onset of slurred speech, facial asymmetry, and right-sided weakness, which are classic signs of a stroke. Given the time frame of 30 minutes since symptom onset, it is crucial to determine whether this is an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke to guide treatment. The most immediate and non-invasive way to differentiate between these types of strokes is a CT scan of the head. A CT head without contrast is the fastest method to rule out hemorrhage, which is critical before considering thrombolytic therapy for an ischemic stroke. Therefore, the next best step in management is to perform a CT head.",10
180,"The clinical presentation and biopsy findings are key to diagnosing this condition. The patient presents with a neck mass and systemic symptoms like fatigue and fever, which are common in lymphomas. The biopsy shows a pattern resembling 'popcorn', which is characteristic of lymphocyte-predominant cells, also known as L&H cells or 'popcorn cells'. These cells are typically found in Nodular Lymphocyte-Predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma (NLPHL). 

Flow cytometry results show cells that are CD19 and CD20 positive, which are B-cell markers, and CD15 and CD30 negative. In classical Hodgkin lymphoma, the Reed-Sternberg cells are usually CD15 and CD30 positive. However, in NLPHL, the neoplastic cells are CD20 positive and CD15/CD30 negative, aligning with the findings in this case.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Nodular Lymphocyte-Predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma (NLPHL).",9
190,"The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramping following the consumption of cold noodle salads at a picnic suggest a foodborne illness, likely due to a bacterial infection such as Salmonella or another similar pathogen. Her vital signs indicate mild dehydration, as evidenced by the low blood pressure. In cases of bacterial gastroenteritis, especially when dehydration is present, the primary treatment is supportive care, focusing on the replacement of fluids and electrolytes to prevent dehydration and maintain hemodynamic stability. Antibiotics are generally not indicated for uncomplicated cases of bacterial gastroenteritis, as they do not significantly alter the course of the illness and can sometimes prolong the carrier state. Therefore, the next best step in management is fluid and electrolyte replacement.",9
194,"The clinical presentation and histopathological findings in this case are suggestive of Krabbe disease, also known as globoid cell leukodystrophy. The key features include developmental regression, myoclonic seizures, optic atrophy, hypertonicity, and the presence of globoid cells in the brain. MRI findings of brain atrophy and hyperintensity in the periventricular and subcortical areas are consistent with demyelination. Krabbe disease is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme β-galactocerebrosidase, leading to the accumulation of psychosine, which is toxic to oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, resulting in the symptoms and histopathological findings described.",9
199,"The patient's symptoms and findings are suggestive of a macular problem. The key symptom here is the distortion of lines on the Amsler grid, which indicates a problem with the macula. The gradual worsening of vision over 8 years, difficulty reading, and the need for bright light are consistent with macular degeneration. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is common in older adults and can cause wavy or distorted vision due to changes in the macula. The patient's age and the description of the visual distortion strongly suggest AMD. Hypertensive and diabetic retinopathy typically present with different symptoms, such as hemorrhages or microaneurysms, and cystoid macular edema would present with different clinical findings. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is age-related macular degeneration.",9
200,"The patient presents with signs of hepatic encephalopathy, fever, leukocytosis, and ascites, which are suggestive of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). In patients with cirrhosis and ascites, SBP is a common complication that can lead to encephalopathy and infection. The fever, leukocytosis, and abdominal tenderness further support this suspicion. An abdominal paracentesis would be the most direct and effective diagnostic test to confirm SBP by analyzing the ascitic fluid for infection (e.g., elevated white blood cell count, especially neutrophils). Other options like a CT of the head or serum ammonia level are less likely to provide immediate diagnostic value for the current presentation. A therapeutic trial of lactulose is not diagnostic.",9
205,"The patient is postmenopausal and presents with vaginal bleeding, which is concerning for endometrial pathology, including endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. The transvaginal ultrasound shows an endometrial thickness of 6 mm, which is above the typical threshold of 4-5 mm for postmenopausal women, suggesting the need for further evaluation. The most appropriate next step in the management of postmenopausal bleeding with an endometrial thickness greater than 4 mm is an endometrial biopsy. This procedure is minimally invasive and can provide a definitive diagnosis of endometrial pathology, such as hyperplasia or carcinoma.",9
216,"The exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes is known as crossing over, which occurs during meiosis. Specifically, crossing over takes place during Prophase I of meiosis. This is when homologous chromosomes pair up and exchange segments of genetic material to increase genetic diversity. Therefore, a molecule that inhibits this process would target Prophase I.",10
209,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with a seizure, likely due to alcohol withdrawal, given his history of chronic alcoholism and recent increase in alcohol consumption. His laboratory results show severe hyponatremia (Na+ 112 mEq/L), which can cause seizures and confusion. The urgent treatment for severe hyponatremia is the administration of hypertonic saline to rapidly increase serum sodium levels. However, correcting hyponatremia too quickly can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS), also known as central pontine myelinolysis. This condition occurs when there is a rapid increase in sodium levels, leading to damage in the brain. Therefore, the urgent treatment of his hyponatremia puts him at increased risk for osmotic myelinolysis.",9
218,"The patient has developed squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin, likely due to repeated exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun. UVB radiation is known to cause specific types of DNA damage, primarily through the formation of pyrimidine dimers, particularly thymidine dimers. This involves the intrastrand cross-linking of thymidine residues in DNA, which leads to mutations if not properly repaired. This mechanism is a well-established cause of skin cancers, including SCC, due to UV exposure. The other options do not directly relate to the specific DNA damage caused by UVB radiation.",9
223,"The boy is showing signs of anaphylaxis, which is a medical emergency characterized by symptoms such as diffuse hives, tongue edema, and hypotension. The most critical step in managing anaphylaxis is the immediate administration of epinephrine, as it can rapidly reverse the symptoms and prevent further deterioration. In emergency situations where a minor's life is at risk and parents cannot be reached, medical professionals are allowed to provide necessary treatment without parental consent. Intubation may be necessary if there is significant airway compromise, but the immediate administration of epinephrine is the priority to stabilize the patient. Therefore, the next best step is to administer epinephrine immediately.",9
220,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Key features include fever, easy bruising, fatigue, and excessive bleeding, along with laboratory findings of pancytopenia, elevated leukocyte count, and coagulopathy (prolonged PT and PTT, low platelets, and positive fibrin split products indicating disseminated intravascular coagulation, DIC). The presence of promyelocytes with Auer rods on a peripheral smear (not shown here but typical for APL) would confirm the diagnosis. APL is treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), which targets the PML-RARA fusion protein and induces differentiation of the leukemic cells, addressing both the leukemia and the coagulopathy.",9
225,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of a possible ectopic pregnancy. She has right lower quadrant abdominal pain, vaginal spotting, and her last menstrual period was 8 weeks ago, which raises suspicion for pregnancy. She uses an IUD, which can increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy. The key diagnostic step in this scenario is to check for pregnancy and determine the location of the gestational sac. A positive urinary beta-HCG test would confirm pregnancy, and the absence of an intrauterine mass on ultrasound would suggest an ectopic pregnancy. Therefore, the most likely association with this patient's diagnosis is a positive urinary beta-HCG and no intrauterine mass, indicating an ectopic pregnancy.",9
224,"The child's developmental milestones indicate that he is on track for gross motor skills, as he can walk with one hand held and throw a ball, which are appropriate for his age. His fine motor skills are also appropriate, as he can pick up objects with a pincer grasp. His social skills are normal, as he can wave 'bye-bye' and shows stranger anxiety. However, his growth is concerning. At 12 months, a child is expected to have tripled their birth weight and increased their length by about 50%. This child was 3061 g at birth and should weigh around 9183 g (20 lb 4 oz) now, but he weighs only 7910 g. His length was 48 cm at birth and should be around 72 cm now, but he is only 60 cm. Therefore, his growth is delayed.",10
227,"The patient's symptoms and biopsy findings suggest a Krukenberg tumor, which is a metastatic ovarian tumor typically originating from a primary gastric carcinoma. The biopsy shows mucin-filled signet-ring cells, which are characteristic of gastric adenocarcinoma metastasizing to the ovaries. The presence of free fluid in the rectouterine pouch (ascites) and bilateral ovarian enlargement further supports this diagnosis. Therefore, further evaluation is most likely to reveal gastric wall thickening due to the primary gastric cancer.",9
229,"The question involves comparing categorical data between two independent groups: whether drowsiness interfered with daily functioning (Yes or No) in the combination treatment group versus the standard treatment group. The data is presented in a 2x2 contingency table format. The Chi-square test is the appropriate statistical method for assessing the significance of differences in categorical data between two or more groups. Multiple linear regression and analysis of variance are used for continuous data, and an unpaired t-test is used for comparing means of continuous data between two groups.",9
231,"The patient presents with hypopigmented macules that do not tan with sun exposure, which have been present for 2 years. These characteristics are consistent with tinea versicolor, a common skin condition caused by Malassezia yeast. This condition is known for causing hypopigmented or hyperpigmented patches that do not tan. The absence of lesions on the palms and soles and the lack of systemic symptoms further support this diagnosis. Other options like cutaneous T cell lymphoma, TYR gene dysfunction, and Treponema pallidum infection are less likely given the presentation and the patient's age.",9
232,"The patient's symptoms and recent travel history suggest an infection with a pathogen that causes bloody diarrhea. The key pathogens to consider include Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, and certain strains of Escherichia coli, such as Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). EHEC is known for causing bloody diarrhea and is associated with a toxin called Shiga toxin. Shiga toxin inhibits protein synthesis by cleaving a specific adenine residue from the 28S rRNA of the 60S ribosomal subunit, thereby inhibiting the 60S ribosomal subunit. This matches with option D. Other options like ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor 2 (A) and ADP-ribosylation of a G protein (C) are mechanisms of action for other toxins, such as diphtheria toxin and cholera toxin, respectively. Stimulation of guanylyl cyclase (B) is associated with heat-stable enterotoxin of E. coli, which causes watery diarrhea, not bloody diarrhea.",9
233,"The patient presents with a firm nodular lump on the labia, which has been present for 5 months. Given her history of lichen sclerosus, she is at increased risk for vulvar malignancy. The presence of a persistent nodular lesion warrants further investigation to rule out malignancy, such as vulvar squamous cell carcinoma. A vulvar punch biopsy is the most appropriate next step to obtain a tissue diagnosis and determine the nature of the lesion.",9
242,"The patient's symptoms and serological findings are indicative of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). She has morning stiffness that improves throughout the day, swelling and erythema in the MCP and PIP joints, and high titers of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies, which are specific for RA. In RA, the underlying pathological process involves synovial hypertrophy and pannus formation, which leads to joint destruction. This is consistent with option D.",9
244,"The patient presents with signs and symptoms suggestive of meningitis, including fever, headache, photophobia, neck stiffness, and a positive Brudzinski's sign. Given her history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and recent chemotherapy, she is immunocompromised, increasing her risk for infections, including bacterial meningitis. In cases of suspected bacterial meningitis, especially in immunocompromised patients, it is crucial to start antibiotic therapy immediately to prevent complications. While a lumbar puncture is typically performed to confirm the diagnosis of meningitis, in this scenario, the immediate initiation of antibiotics takes precedence due to the high risk of rapid deterioration. Imaging studies like CT or MRI are not immediately necessary unless there are signs of increased intracranial pressure or focal neurological deficits that suggest a mass lesion, which is not clearly indicated here. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to start antibiotic therapy.",9
236,"The patient's symptoms and findings are suggestive of hereditary hemochromatosis, a condition characterized by excessive iron deposition in various organs. The key findings include fatigue, reduced libido, joint pain, tanned skin, small testes, hepatomegaly, and liver biopsy showing iron deposition (Prussian blue staining). Hemochromatosis can lead to several complications due to iron overload, including liver cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, skin pigmentation, and cardiac issues. Among the listed options, restrictive cardiomyopathy is a known complication of hemochromatosis due to iron deposition in the heart, leading to cardiac dysfunction.",9
241,"The patient's symptoms include aggression, hallucinations, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and nystagmus. These are classic signs of intoxication with phencyclidine (PCP). PCP is known to cause aggressive behavior, hallucinations, and nystagmus (both horizontal and vertical). The mechanism of action of PCP is primarily as an NMDA receptor antagonist. This blocks the action of glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, leading to the dissociative and psychotomimetic effects observed in the patient.",9
177,,0
254,"The patient's presentation is consistent with anticholinergic toxicity, characterized by hyperthermia, tachycardia, dry skin, mydriasis (dilated pupils), and confusion. These symptoms suggest the ingestion of a substance with anticholinergic properties, such as antihistamines, tricyclic antidepressants, or antipsychotics. Physostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that can cross the blood-brain barrier and is used to reverse central and peripheral anticholinergic effects. The other options are not appropriate for anticholinergic toxicity: Sodium bicarbonate is used for tricyclic antidepressant overdose with cardiac toxicity, glucagon is used for beta-blocker overdose, and flumazenil is used for benzodiazepine overdose.",9
247,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI), which is caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. This condition often presents with a triad of tenosynovitis, dermatitis, and polyarthralgia, or with purulent arthritis. The patient has fever, pustular skin lesions, and a swollen, tender knee with purulent synovial fluid, all of which are consistent with DGI. The negative Gram stain is not uncommon in gonococcal infections due to the fastidious nature of the organism. The recommended treatment for DGI is ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin, to cover Neisseria gonorrhoeae, along with azithromycin to cover potential co-infection with Chlamydia trachomatis. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral azithromycin.",9
253,"The patient presents with painless lymphadenopathy, night sweats, weight loss, and splenomegaly, which are classic B symptoms associated with lymphoma. His history of a kidney transplant and immunosuppressive therapy (tacrolimus and mycophenolate) increases his risk for lymphoproliferative disorders, such as Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). The elevated LDH level and cytopenias (anemia and thrombocytopenia) further support a diagnosis of NHL. Drug-induced lymphadenopathy is less likely given the systemic symptoms and splenomegaly. Cytomegalovirus infection could cause lymphadenopathy but is less likely to cause such extensive systemic symptoms and splenomegaly. Multiple myeloma typically presents with bone pain, renal failure, hypercalcemia, and anemia, but not with lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.",9
256,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are suggestive of temporal arteritis (giant cell arteritis). This condition is characterized by inflammation of the temporal arteries and can lead to serious complications if not treated promptly. The symptoms of fatigue, headache, and jaw claudication (discomfort with chewing) are classic for this condition. One of the most feared complications of untreated temporal arteritis is blindness, due to ischemia of the optic nerve. Immediate treatment with corticosteroids is crucial to prevent this outcome.",10
250,"The patient has been diagnosed with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), which is a condition characterized by the presence of an abnormal monoclonal protein in the blood. MGUS is considered a precursor to more serious plasma cell disorders. The most common progression of MGUS is to multiple myeloma, a cancer of plasma cells that can cause bone lesions, anemia, renal failure, and hypercalcemia. Waldenström macroglobulinemia is another potential progression but is less common than multiple myeloma. Acute myelocytic leukemia and chronic myelocytic leukemia are not typically associated with MGUS. Therefore, the disease most likely to develop from MGUS is multiple myeloma.",9
264,"The clinical presentation of the 7-year-old girl includes hearing impairment, multiple old fractures, and a diet lacking in variety. These findings suggest a condition affecting bone strength and integrity. The key points are the hearing impairment and multiple fractures, which are characteristic of osteogenesis imperfecta. This condition is caused by a deficiency of type 1 collagen, leading to brittle bones and other connective tissue issues. The diet mentioned does not directly relate to the etiology of osteogenesis imperfecta, as it is a genetic disorder rather than a nutritional deficiency. Therefore, the most likely etiology of the patient's disease is a deficiency of type 1 collagen.",9
258,"The patient has undergone a 50 g oral glucose challenge test, which is a screening test for gestational diabetes. A glucose level of 156 mg/dL at 1 hour is above the typical threshold of 140 mg/dL, indicating the need for further testing. The next step is to perform a diagnostic test, which is the 3-hour 100 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). This test will confirm whether the patient has gestational diabetes. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to administer the 3-hour 100 g glucose dose.",10
272,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest a diagnosis of beta-thalassemia major (Cooley's anemia). The child has pallor, abdominal distention, hepatosplenomegaly, and frontal bossing, which are indicative of chronic hemolytic anemia and extramedullary hematopoiesis. The hemoglobin electrophoresis showing increased HbF and HbA2 levels is characteristic of beta-thalassemia major, where there is a deficiency or absence of beta-globin chains, leading to ineffective erythropoiesis and anemia. On a peripheral blood smear, beta-thalassemia major typically shows microcytosis (small red blood cells) and hypochromasia (pale red blood cells) due to the reduced hemoglobin content in the erythrocytes.",9
267,"The clinical presentation of the patient suggests opioid overdose, characterized by unresponsiveness, respiratory depression, and pinpoint pupils. The drug administered intravenously that rapidly reverses these symptoms is likely naloxone, an opioid antagonist. Naloxone works by competitively binding to opioid receptors, particularly the μ-receptor, which is responsible for the effects of opioids such as respiratory depression and miosis. The rapid improvement in consciousness and respiration after administration supports this mechanism of action.",10
274,"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with osteoarthritis (OA). She has progressive pain and stiffness in her fingers, which worsens at the end of the day, a common feature of OA due to joint use. The involvement of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints with hard swellings (likely Heberden's nodes) is characteristic of OA. The first metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint involvement is less typical but can occur. The absence of systemic symptoms and the pattern of joint involvement make rheumatoid arthritis (autoimmune-mediated cartilage erosion) less likely. The discrete, hard swellings are not consistent with an infectious process or crystal deposition disease like gout or pseudogout. Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism is degenerative disease of the joints, which is characteristic of osteoarthritis.",9
277,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs consistent with an acute myocardial infarction (MI), specifically an anterior wall MI, as indicated by the ST-segment elevation in leads V1 to V6. The echocardiogram shows anterolateral hypokinesis and retrograde blood flow into the left atrium, suggesting mitral regurgitation. This is likely due to papillary muscle dysfunction or rupture, a known complication of MI, particularly involving the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. The low blood pressure and pulmonary rales indicate cardiogenic shock and pulmonary edema, respectively, which can occur due to severe mitral regurgitation from papillary muscle rupture. Therefore, the mechanism of this patient's illness is most consistent with occlusion of the LAD artery leading to rupture of a papillary muscle.",9
281,"The scenario describes a physician experiencing burnout symptoms, such as fatigue and making errors. The psychiatrist's evaluation rules out primary psychiatric disorders, suggesting the issue is related to work conditions. National surveys often identify excessive bureaucratic tasks, such as paperwork and administrative duties, as a major contributor to physician burnout. While the number of patients, working hours, and concern over reputation can contribute to stress, bureaucratic tasks are more frequently recognized as a significant factor.",9
283,"The boy presents with a high fever, sore throat, cervical lymphadenopathy, tonsillar erythema and exudate, and a characteristic rash. The rash is described as a confluent, blanching, punctate erythematous rash with a rough texture, which is indicative of scarlet fever. Scarlet fever is caused by Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) and is associated with a streptococcal pharyngitis. The treatment of choice for streptococcal pharyngitis is penicillin or amoxicillin. However, given the patient's history of an allergic reaction to dicloxacillin, a penicillin derivative, it is prudent to avoid penicillins. Azithromycin is a suitable alternative for treating streptococcal infections in patients with penicillin allergy.",9
285,"The patient is a pregnant woman at 37 weeks of gestation with a history of pregnancy-induced hypertension who has experienced a seizure. Her symptoms and history are consistent with eclampsia, which is characterized by the onset of seizures in a woman with preeclampsia. The most immediate concern in eclampsia is to prevent further seizures and manage the condition. The first-line treatment for preventing further seizures in eclampsia is intravenous magnesium sulfate. While delivery is the definitive treatment for eclampsia, the immediate step is to stabilize the patient with magnesium sulfate before considering delivery options.",9
293,"The infant is presenting with anemia of prematurity, which is common in preterm infants. The key laboratory findings are a low hemoglobin level and a low reticulocyte count, indicating decreased red blood cell production. In preterm infants, the primary cause of anemia is impaired erythropoietin production due to the immature kidneys and liver, which are responsible for erythropoietin synthesis. This results in decreased stimulation of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells, leading to anemia. The normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and absence of hemolysis or blood loss further support this diagnosis. Other options like bone marrow suppression or enzyme deficiencies are less likely given the clinical context and lab findings.",9
290,"The clinical presentation suggests that the child is experiencing an asthma exacerbation, likely triggered by cold air exposure. The nebulized medication used in this scenario is most likely a beta-2 adrenergic agonist, such as albuterol. Beta-2 agonists work by stimulating beta-2 adrenergic receptors, which are coupled to Gs proteins. Activation of these receptors leads to an increase in adenylate cyclase activity, which converts ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP). The increase in cAMP results in bronchodilation by relaxing bronchial smooth muscle, thereby relieving the wheezing and breathing difficulties. Therefore, the correct answer is that cyclic AMP is increased as a result of the medication.",9
299,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a classic case of reactive arthritis. He has a triad of symptoms: urethritis (pain with urination), conjunctivitis (bilateral inflammation of the conjunctiva), and arthritis (pain and swelling in the knee and previously in the ankle). The presence of Achilles tendon tenderness also supports this diagnosis. Reactive arthritis often follows a genitourinary or gastrointestinal infection, and the patient's inconsistent condom use and sexual activity increase the likelihood of a preceding chlamydial infection, which is a common trigger. The negative Gram stain and high leukocyte count in the synovial fluid further support a non-infectious inflammatory process rather than septic arthritis. Lyme arthritis and syphilitic arthritis are less likely given the clinical presentation and history.",9
298,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible endocrine-related tumor. The painless neck lump and difficulty swallowing indicate a thyroid nodule. The history of recurrent nephrolithiasis and episodic hypertension is suggestive of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome, particularly MEN 2, which includes medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma (causing episodic hypertension), and hyperparathyroidism (leading to nephrolithiasis). Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid arises from parafollicular C cells and is associated with MEN 2. The other options are less likely given the systemic symptoms and the typical presentation of MEN 2.",9
302,"In this case-control study, women with chlamydia were informed about the potential serious consequences of the disease and the importance of locating and treating their sexual partners. This information might have influenced how they reported the number of sexual partners, possibly leading them to underreport or overreport based on perceived judgment or stigma. This is a classic example of reporting bias, where the participants' responses are influenced by their awareness of their condition and the associated consequences. The bias arises because the cases (women with chlamydia) might report differently than the controls (women without chlamydia) due to this awareness, rather than an actual difference in behavior.",9
294,"The patient presents with symptoms and a history suggestive of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), likely emphysema, given her smoking history and the presence of wheezing and chronic cough. The arterial blood gas analysis shows respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation, which is consistent with chronic respiratory disease. In emphysema, there is destruction of alveolar walls leading to decreased surface area for gas exchange, which results in a decreased diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO). This is because DLCO measures the ability of the lungs to transfer gas from inhaled air to the blood, and in emphysema, this ability is impaired due to the loss of alveolar surface area. Other options such as decreased lung residual volume and decreased lung compliance are not characteristic of emphysema. A shift of the flow volume loop to the right is more indicative of restrictive lung disease, not obstructive.",9
304,"The patient's symptoms include chronic diarrhea, lower abdominal discomfort relieved by diarrhea, urgency, mucus discharge, and a feeling of incomplete evacuation. These symptoms are suggestive of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), especially given the normal stool examination and blood tests. The history of camping and another member of the party falling ill could suggest an infectious cause like giardiasis, but the normal stool examination makes this less likely. Crohn's disease would typically present with more systemic symptoms and abnormal lab findings. Laxative abuse would also likely show some abnormalities in lab tests or electrolyte imbalances. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis, given the symptom pattern and normal lab results, is IBS.",9
311,"The scenario describes a patient who has just delivered a baby and placenta, but a smooth mass continues to follow, which suggests uterine inversion. Uterine inversion can lead to significant blood loss and is a known cause of postpartum hemorrhage. Given her history of postpartum hemorrhage and the current situation, the most likely complication without intervention is hemorrhagic shock due to excessive bleeding. The other options, such as heart failure, hypertension, and hyperthermia, are not directly related to the immediate complications of uterine inversion.",9
300,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), including nocturia and an enlarged prostate on examination. The goal is to relieve urinary symptoms while considering his history of symptomatic hypotension. 

Alpha-1 blockers like tamsulosin (A) are commonly used to relieve BPH symptoms by relaxing smooth muscle in the bladder neck and prostate, improving urine flow. However, they can cause orthostatic hypotension, which is a concern given the patient's history of syncope.

Finasteride (B) is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor that reduces prostate size by blocking the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. It is effective in reducing prostate size and improving symptoms but takes several months to show effects. It does not cause hypotension, making it a safer option for this patient.

Tadalafil (C) is a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor used for erectile dysfunction and can also improve BPH symptoms. It does not typically cause hypotension but is not the first-line treatment for BPH.

Leuprolide (D) is a GnRH agonist used for prostate cancer, not BPH.

Given the patient's history of syncope and desire for less invasive treatment, finasteride is the recommended option as it avoids the risk of hypotension associated with alpha-1 blockers.",9
312,"The patient presents with a triad of symptoms: a right-sided hydrothorax (pleural effusion), ascites, and a large ovarian mass. These symptoms are characteristic of Meigs syndrome, which is associated with benign ovarian tumors, most commonly fibromas. The resolution of ascites and pleural effusion after the removal of the ovarian mass further supports this diagnosis. Metastatic cancers (options A and B) would not typically resolve so promptly after surgery, and nephrotic syndrome (option D) would not be associated with an ovarian mass.",9
314,"The patient is an elderly woman with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and stable angina, who is on medications including warfarin, aspirin, and hydrochlorothiazide. She presents with syncope after standing up, dizziness, hypotension, and signs of dehydration (dry tongue, delayed skin turgor). These findings suggest that she may be experiencing orthostatic hypotension, likely exacerbated by dehydration due to diuretic use (hydrochlorothiazide). Dehydration can lead to prerenal azotemia, characterized by an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentration relative to creatinine. Therefore, further evaluation is most likely to show elevated BUN due to dehydration and possible volume depletion.",9
313,"The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and presents with fatigue, pruritus, scleral icterus, and elevated liver enzymes, particularly alkaline phosphatase, which suggests cholestasis. The abdominal ultrasound shows thickening of the bile ducts and focal bile duct dilatation. These findings are characteristic of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), which is commonly associated with inflammatory bowel disease, particularly ulcerative colitis. The negative antimitochondrial antibodies make primary biliary cholangitis unlikely, and the negative anti-nuclear antibody makes autoimmune hepatitis less likely. Hepatitis B infection would typically present with different serological markers and is not associated with bile duct thickening. IgG4-associated cholangitis is less common and would typically have elevated IgG4 levels, which are not mentioned here. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is primary sclerosing cholangitis.",9
266,"The patient has monosymptomatic enuresis, meaning bedwetting in the absence of any other lower urinary tract symptoms or bladder dysfunction. Initial management includes educating parents and behavioral interventions. If there is persistence despite this initial approach, further intervention may be warranted to help manage symptoms. Between medication options like desmopressin (DDAVP) and behavioral options like an enuresis alarm, an enuresis alarm is often recommended next, as it is a highly effective non-pharmacological approach. It helps children connect the sensation of a full bladder with waking up to use the bathroom. DDAVP can be used if the alarm method fails or is not suitable for the patient.",9
319,"The patient with chronic anorexia nervosa is at risk for refeeding syndrome, which can occur when nutrition is reintroduced too quickly. This condition is characterized by electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypophosphatemia, due to the shift of electrolytes into cells as metabolism increases. The symptoms of confusion, disorientation, and muscle weakness, along with tachycardia and tachypnea, suggest possible electrolyte disturbances. The next step in management should be to measure electrolytes to identify and correct any imbalances, such as hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, or hypomagnesemia, which are common in refeeding syndrome.",9
315,"The patient's symptoms and findings are suggestive of carcinoid syndrome, which is characterized by flushing, diarrhea, and wheezing due to the release of serotonin and other vasoactive substances. The increased 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the urine supports this diagnosis, as 5-HIAA is a metabolite of serotonin. Carcinoid tumors typically originate in the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in the small intestine or appendix, and can metastasize to the liver. When metastasis occurs, the vasoactive substances can bypass liver metabolism and cause systemic symptoms, including left-sided heart lesions due to serotonin's effect on the heart valves. 

The presence of left-sided heart lesions (mitral regurgitation) is unusual for carcinoid syndrome, which typically affects the right side of the heart. However, if there is a primary tumor in the lung, the serotonin can directly enter the systemic circulation, affecting the left side of the heart. 

Therefore, the most likely finding is a tumor in the lung without metastasis, as this would explain the left-sided cardiac involvement without the need for hepatic metastasis.",9
325,"The clinical presentation of progressive difficulty climbing stairs, problems with running, occasional falls, and standing from a chair, along with enlarged calf muscles (pseudohypertrophy) and elevated creatine kinase levels, is suggestive of a muscular dystrophy, particularly Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy. These conditions are caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. The most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis of a dystrophinopathy is genetic analysis to identify mutations in the dystrophin gene.",9
323,"The patient presents with diarrhea, weight loss, hoarseness, and a thyroid mass. The lab findings show hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia. These symptoms and lab findings are suggestive of medullary thyroid carcinoma, which can be associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2). MEN 2 can include medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and primary hyperparathyroidism. The episodic hypertension and headaches are characteristic of pheochromocytoma, which is part of MEN 2. Therefore, the presence of episodic hypertension and headaches would be consistent with this diagnosis.",9
301,"The patient presents with a skin lesion that has increased in size over 2 months, is partly elevated, and does not change form on pinching. This description, along with the patient's age and smoking history, suggests a concern for a skin malignancy. 

- **Malignant melanoma (A)**: Typically presents as a pigmented lesion with irregular borders, color variation, and can be elevated. It often changes in size and shape, which matches some aspects of the patient's lesion.
- **Keratoacanthoma (B)**: A rapidly growing, dome-shaped nodule that can appear similar to squamous cell carcinoma. It usually has a central keratin plug, which is not mentioned here.
- **Lentigo maligna (C)**: A subtype of melanoma that presents as a flat, pigmented lesion, usually on sun-exposed areas in older adults. It does not typically present as elevated.
- **Basal cell carcinoma (D)**: Often presents as a pearly, flesh-colored papule with telangiectasia, sometimes with central ulceration. It is usually slow-growing and less likely to be described as partly elevated and changing in size quickly.

Given the lesion's rapid change in size and elevation, malignant melanoma is the most consistent with these characteristics.",9
326,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of acute rheumatic fever (ARF), which typically follows a group A streptococcal infection, such as pharyngitis. The patient's history of a sore throat 3 weeks ago, followed by migratory arthritis and erythema marginatum, aligns with ARF. To diagnose ARF, the Jones criteria are used, which require evidence of a preceding streptococcal infection along with major and minor criteria. The major criteria include migratory arthritis, carditis, subcutaneous nodules, erythema marginatum, and Sydenham's chorea. The minor criteria include fever, arthralgia, elevated acute phase reactants (like ESR), and prolonged PR interval. However, the key to confirming ARF is evidence of a preceding streptococcal infection, which can be established by positive anti-streptococcal serology.",9
329,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with adhesive capsulitis, also known as frozen shoulder. This condition is characterized by a gradual onset of shoulder pain and stiffness, leading to a significant reduction in both active and passive range of motion. The pain is often worse at night and with movement, and there is difficulty with activities that require shoulder movement, such as dressing. The normal strength of the rotator cuff and normal radiographs help rule out a rotator cuff injury and glenohumeral arthritis. Degenerative cervical spine disease would likely present with neck pain and possibly neurological symptoms, which are absent here. The patient's history of diabetes mellitus is a known risk factor for adhesive capsulitis.",9
332,"The patient presents with hyponatremia (serum Na 122 mEq/L) and mental status changes. The key laboratory findings are a low serum sodium and a high urine osmolality (334 mOsm/kg) with high urine sodium (45 mEq/L). This suggests that the kidneys are excreting concentrated urine despite the low serum sodium, indicating inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) activity. 

Diarrhea (A) typically causes hypovolemic hyponatremia with low urine sodium due to volume depletion, which doesn't match the lab findings.

Diabetes insipidus (B) would present with hypernatremia and dilute urine, which is not consistent with the findings.

Primary polydipsia (C) usually results in dilute urine due to excessive water intake, which is not consistent with the high urine osmolality.

Lung cancer (D), specifically small cell lung cancer, can cause the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), leading to euvolemic hyponatremia with concentrated urine, matching the patient's presentation.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is SIADH due to lung cancer.",9
335,"The patient's symptoms include behavioral changes, hallucinations (talking to empty chairs), sleep disturbances, and parkinsonian features (mild left-hand tremor, increased muscle tone, slow alternating movements, and gait difficulties). These symptoms are characteristic of Lewy body dementia. Alzheimer's disease typically presents with memory impairment as the primary symptom without prominent hallucinations or parkinsonism early in the disease. Frontotemporal dementia often involves personality changes and language difficulties but not usually hallucinations or parkinsonism. Serotonin syndrome is characterized by autonomic instability, neuromuscular abnormalities, and altered mental status, which does not fit this patient's presentation. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Lewy body dementia.",9
338,"The symptoms and findings in this case suggest a lingual thyroid, which is a result of ectopic thyroid tissue at the base of the tongue. This occurs due to the failure of the thyroid gland to descend from its embryological origin at the foramen cecum to its normal position in the neck. The technetium-99m pertechnetate scan likely shows uptake at the base of the tongue, confirming the presence of thyroid tissue there. The patient's symptoms of difficulty swallowing and breathing, especially after an upper respiratory infection, are consistent with the swelling of this ectopic thyroid tissue. The dry and cool skin suggests hypothyroidism, which can occur if the ectopic thyroid tissue is the only functioning thyroid tissue and is insufficient. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause is arrested endodermal migration from the pharyngeal floor, which corresponds to option C.",9
339,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with heat stroke, including high fever, altered mental status, hypotension, and elevated creatine kinase levels indicating rhabdomyolysis. The dark brown urine suggests myoglobinuria, a result of muscle breakdown. The most immediate concern is to rapidly reduce the patient's core body temperature to prevent further organ damage. Ice water immersion is the most effective method for rapid cooling in cases of exertional heat stroke, which is likely given the patient's work environment and presentation. Other options like acetaminophen and dantrolene are not appropriate for heat stroke, and hemodialysis is not indicated at this stage.",9
340,"The patient's serology results show a negative HBsAg, indicating no current hepatitis B infection. The presence of anti-HBs (HBsAb) suggests immunity to hepatitis B. The negative HBc IgM indicates no recent infection, while the positive HBc IgG indicates past exposure to the virus. This combination of positive anti-HBs and positive anti-HBc IgG, with negative HBsAg, is consistent with immunity due to past infection, not vaccination, as vaccination would not result in positive anti-HBc IgG.",9
341,"The patient's symptoms and findings suggest diastolic heart failure, also known as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). This condition is often associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) due to long-standing hypertension. The echocardiogram shows a normal ejection fraction, which aligns with diastolic dysfunction rather than systolic dysfunction. In diastolic heart failure, the heart muscle becomes stiff and less compliant, often due to hypertrophy. 

The key myocardial change in this scenario is ventricular hypertrophy with sarcomeres duplicated in parallel, which is characteristic of hypertrophy due to pressure overload, such as from hypertension. This is in contrast to sarcomeres duplicated in series, which is seen in volume overload conditions.

The presence of a loud S4 heart sound also supports the diagnosis of LVH, as it indicates a stiff ventricle. The mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette on chest radiograph further supports the presence of hypertrophy.

Therefore, the most likely myocardial change in this patient is ventricular hypertrophy with sarcomeres duplicated in parallel.",9
346,"The patient is a 7-year-old African-American boy with symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with sickle cell disease (SCD). SCD increases the risk of infections, particularly from encapsulated bacteria, due to functional asplenia. This includes increased susceptibility to infections by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae type b. Therefore, patients with SCD require additional vaccinations to protect against these infections. The meningococcal vaccines are important in this population. The serogroup B meningococcal vaccine is recommended for children with SCD starting at age 10. Thus, the correct statement regarding vaccination in this patient is that he should receive the serogroup B meningococcal vaccination at the age of 10 years.",9
345,"The patient's symptoms and clinical presentation suggest digoxin toxicity. The symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and visual disturbances are classic for digoxin toxicity. The physical exam findings of heart failure (displaced PMI, rales, S3 gallop, hepatomegaly) are consistent with underlying heart disease, which digoxin is often used to treat. The sudden change to ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation is also characteristic of digoxin toxicity, as digoxin can cause various arrhythmias, including these life-threatening ones. The patient's statement about taking 'some pills' in varying amounts suggests possible overdose or improper dosing, which is common with digoxin due to its narrow therapeutic index.",9
348,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with bacterial conjunctivitis: redness, foreign body sensation, discharge, and eyelids stuck together with yellow crusts. The purulent discharge suggests a bacterial cause rather than viral or allergic conjunctivitis. Given the bilateral nature and purulent discharge, a common bacterial cause is likely. Topical antibiotics are the standard treatment for bacterial conjunctivitis. Topical erythromycin is a common choice for treating bacterial conjunctivitis due to its effectiveness and safety profile. Topical natamycin is used for fungal infections, topical prednisolone acetate is a steroid used for inflammatory conditions, and oral erythromycin is not typically used for conjunctivitis.",9
316,,0
350,"The patient presents with shortness of breath, hypotension, tachycardia, and hypoxemia after exposure to a potential allergen, suggesting anaphylaxis. His history of atopic dermatitis and asthma increases his risk for allergic reactions. In anaphylaxis, the first-line treatment is intramuscular (IM) epinephrine, which rapidly addresses airway, breathing, and circulation issues. While IV fluids and oxygen are supportive, they do not address the underlying cause as effectively as epinephrine. Albuterol and prednisone are not immediate treatments for anaphylaxis. IV epinephrine is not typically used initially due to the risk of severe side effects and is reserved for refractory cases.",9
352,"The patient presents with hyponatremia (sodium level of 120 mEq/L) and low serum osmolality (248 mOsm/kg), which indicates a hypotonic hyponatremia. His urine osmolality is high, suggesting that the kidneys are concentrating urine despite the low serum osmolality. This is consistent with the Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH), where there is excessive release of ADH leading to water retention, dilutional hyponatremia, and concentrated urine. The patient's moist mucous membranes and lack of edema suggest euvolemia, which is typical in SIADH. The other options do not fit the clinical picture: Sheehan’s syndrome is related to postpartum pituitary failure, lithium use typically causes nephrogenic diabetes insipidus leading to hypernatremia, and diabetic ketoacidosis presents with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis, not hyponatremia with low serum osmolality.",9
355,"The patient has syphilis, as indicated by the positive RPR test and confirmation by darkfield microscopy. Syphilis can be transmitted from mother to fetus, leading to congenital syphilis. Congenital syphilis can cause a variety of complications in the fetus and newborn. Among the options provided, 'saddle nose' is a classic manifestation of congenital syphilis, resulting from damage to the nasal cartilage. Vision loss, chorioretinitis, and muscle atrophy are not typical features of congenital syphilis. Therefore, the fetus is at risk for developing a saddle nose due to the mother's syphilis infection.",9
351,"The patient is 30 weeks pregnant with a fundal height of 25 centimeters, indicating intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). The ultrasound shows a proportional reduction in fetal head circumference, trunk size, and limb length, suggesting symmetric IUGR. Symmetric IUGR is often due to fetal factors such as chromosomal abnormalities or congenital infections. Rubella infection is a known cause of symmetric IUGR due to its teratogenic effects during pregnancy. Antiphospholipid syndrome and pre-eclampsia typically cause asymmetric IUGR due to placental insufficiency. Gestational diabetes usually results in macrosomia rather than growth restriction. Therefore, the most likely cause of the symmetric IUGR in this case is a congenital infection like rubella.",9
356,"The patient was started on a 4-drug regimen for tuberculosis, which typically includes isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. After 6 months, she presents with symptoms suggestive of drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE), characterized by joint pain, a photosensitive rash, and positive ANA and anti-histone antibodies. Among the drugs used in the treatment of tuberculosis, isoniazid is known to cause drug-induced lupus. The presence of anti-histone antibodies is particularly indicative of DILE, which is most commonly associated with isoniazid in this context.",9
353,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest osteoarthritis of the hip. She experiences pain that worsens throughout the day, which is characteristic of osteoarthritis. Her obesity is a risk factor for osteoarthritis, and the physical exam findings of decreased range of motion and crepitus further support this diagnosis. The pain localized to the groin is typical for hip joint involvement. Radiography in osteoarthritis typically shows loss of joint space and osteophyte formation. The other options are less likely given the presentation: hyperdense foci in the ureters would suggest kidney stones, which doesn't match her symptoms; a femoral neck fracture would likely present with more acute pain and inability to bear weight; normal radiography would not explain her chronic symptoms and physical findings.",9
358,"The patient has symptoms that are consistent with fat embolism syndrome, which typically occurs after long bone fractures such as the femur. The key features include respiratory distress (tachypnea), neurological symptoms (delirium), and a petechial rash. These symptoms are due to fat globules entering the circulation and causing microvascular occlusion and inflammation. This aligns with option B, which describes fat microglobules in the microvasculature.",9
333,,0
359,"The patient has a rapidly growing lung nodule with ipsilateral mediastinal lymph node involvement, and the biopsy shows small, dark blue tumor cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and scarce cytoplasm, which are characteristic of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is typically treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy rather than surgical resection due to its aggressive nature and tendency to metastasize early. The absence of distant metastases suggests limited-stage disease, but the presence of mediastinal lymph node involvement still indicates the need for systemic therapy. Therefore, the most appropriate management is chemotherapy with cisplatin-etoposide and concurrent radiotherapy.",9
357,"The patient presents with sudden onset lower limb paralysis, back pain, and a compression fracture of the thoracic vertebra. He also has anemia, elevated ESR, hypercalcemia, and renal impairment. These findings are suggestive of multiple myeloma, a condition characterized by the proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. These cells produce osteoclast-activating factors, leading to increased bone resorption and lytic bone lesions, which can cause fractures. The hypercalcemia and renal impairment further support this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely mechanism for the vertebral fracture is the proliferation of tumor cells, which is consistent with multiple myeloma.",9
363,"The patient's presentation of bilateral eye pain, redness, and corneal ulceration, along with a history of recent unprotected sex, suggests a possible infectious cause. The most common infectious causes of corneal ulcers in contact lens wearers are bacterial, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Gatifloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic effective against a broad range of bacteria, including Pseudomonas. Acyclovir is used for viral infections like herpes simplex keratitis, which is less likely given the bilateral presentation and history. Intravitreal antibiotics are used for severe intraocular infections like endophthalmitis, not corneal ulcers. Topical steroids like dexamethasone are contraindicated in infectious keratitis as they can worsen the infection. Therefore, the best treatment is gatifloxacin eye drops.",9
360,"The newborn is preterm at 33 weeks of gestation and presents with respiratory distress, including tachypnea, grunting, retractions, and cyanosis. The chest radiograph shows a fine reticular granulation with a ground glass appearance, which is characteristic of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), also known as hyaline membrane disease. This condition is common in preterm infants due to surfactant deficiency. Pneumothorax would typically show a different radiographic appearance, such as a visible pleural line and absence of lung markings. Transient tachypnea of the newborn usually occurs in term or near-term infants and presents with fluid in the fissures on X-ray. Cyanotic congenital heart disease would present with different clinical and radiographic findings.",9
364,"The patient presents with progressive personality changes, aggression, and urinary incontinence, which are suggestive of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). The MRI likely shows ventriculomegaly without significant cortical atrophy, which is characteristic of NPH. The next best diagnostic step to confirm NPH is a lumbar puncture to perform a high-volume tap test. This involves removing a large volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to see if there is an improvement in symptoms, which would support the diagnosis of NPH.",9
365,"The patient presents with symptoms of hypoglycemia, which are relieved by eating or drinking sugary drinks. Her blood glucose level is low, and laboratory results show elevated serum insulin and C-peptide levels, with normal proinsulin levels. The negative sulfonylurea test rules out sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia. The presence of elevated C-peptide and insulin levels suggests endogenous insulin production, ruling out exogenous insulin use (which would show low C-peptide levels). The normal proinsulin level indicates that the insulin is not from a proinsulin-secreting tumor. These findings are consistent with an insulinoma, a beta cell tumor of the pancreas, which secretes insulin and causes hypoglycemia.",9
373,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma. The key features include recurring fevers, night sweats, weight loss, and painless lymphadenopathy. The cyclical nature of the fevers (Pel-Ebstein fevers) and the presence of painless, fixed cervical lymph nodes are characteristic of Hodgkin lymphoma. The history of infectious mononucleosis (caused by Epstein-Barr virus) is relevant as EBV is associated with Hodgkin lymphoma. The biopsy of the lymph node would likely show Reed-Sternberg cells, which are CD15 and CD30 positive. This aligns with option B.",9
366,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings are consistent with iron deficiency anemia. The child has microcytic, hypochromic anemia with low serum iron and ferritin levels, and high TIBC, which are indicative of iron deficiency. The history of high milk intake and being a picky eater further supports this diagnosis, as excessive milk consumption can lead to iron deficiency anemia in toddlers. The next best step in management is to address the dietary cause of the anemia by limiting milk intake and ensuring adequate iron intake.",9
374,"The patient's symptoms of altered mental status, pinpoint pupils, and respiratory depression suggest opioid overdose. Opioids, such as morphine or oxycodone, are commonly used for pain management in patients with fractures. The mechanism of action of opioids involves binding to opioid receptors, which are G-protein coupled receptors. Activation of these receptors leads to neuronal hyperpolarization primarily through increased potassium efflux and decreased calcium influx, reducing neurotransmitter release. However, the most direct mechanism related to hyperpolarization is potassium efflux. Therefore, the mechanism of action of the drug likely causing this patient's symptoms is neuronal hyperpolarization due to potassium efflux.",9
375,"The patient presents with symptoms and lab findings suggestive of hemolytic anemia, including jaundice, splenomegaly, low haptoglobin, and elevated indirect bilirubin. The recent use of nitrofurantoin, a known oxidative stressor, and the patient's African descent suggest glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. G6PD deficiency is an enzyme deficiency in red blood cells that leads to hemolysis under oxidative stress. The normal MCV and elevated reticulocyte count further support hemolysis. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause is an enzyme deficiency in red blood cells.",9
377,"The infant's presentation of differential cyanosis, where the upper body is pink and the lower body is cyanotic, suggests a condition where there is differential blood flow between the upper and lower parts of the body. This is typically seen in patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) with right-to-left shunting, often due to pulmonary hypertension or other conditions causing increased right-sided pressures. In such cases, deoxygenated blood from the pulmonary artery can flow through the PDA into the descending aorta, leading to cyanosis of the lower extremities. The classic murmur associated with a PDA is a continuous ""machinery"" murmur, heard best at the left upper sternal border.",9
382,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of dehydration due to diarrhea, including hypotension, tachycardia, and decreased urine output. These symptoms are consistent with hypovolemia. In hypovolemic states, the kidneys attempt to conserve water and sodium, leading to a concentrated urine with low sodium content. This results in a high serum BUN/creatinine ratio (>20), as the kidneys reabsorb more urea relative to creatinine. Therefore, the expected lab abnormality in this patient is a serum BUN/Cr ratio greater than 20, indicating prerenal azotemia due to volume depletion.",9
380,"This 6-day-old newborn presents with jaundice, weight loss, and signs of dehydration. The total bilirubin level is elevated, with a predominantly indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia, which is common in newborns. The baby is breastfeeding 7 times per day but has only had two wet diapers and two bowel movements, indicating inadequate intake. The weight loss from 3500 g to 3000 g is significant, suggesting insufficient breastfeeding. This is consistent with breastfeeding jaundice, which occurs due to inadequate intake leading to dehydration and increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin. The most appropriate management is to increase the frequency of breastfeeding to improve hydration and bilirubin clearance.",9
388,"The patient initially presents with symptoms and imaging findings consistent with pneumonia, likely bacterial given the improvement with antibiotics. The development of right-sided chest pain and new scratchy, high-pitched breath sounds (pleural friction rub) suggests pleuritis or pleurisy, which is inflammation of the pleura. Histologically, pleuritis is characterized by a fibrinous exudate, which corresponds to a fibrin-rich infiltrate. This is consistent with the inflammatory process following pneumonia, where fibrin deposition occurs on the pleural surfaces.",9
385,"The patient is a 71-year-old man presenting with fatigue, malaise, significant unintentional weight loss, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. These symptoms are suggestive of a hematologic malignancy. Given his age, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in older adults. CLL typically presents with lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and sometimes constitutional symptoms like weight loss and fatigue. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is more common in children, and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) usually presents with more acute symptoms and is less associated with lymphadenopathy. Hairy cell leukemia can present with splenomegaly and pancytopenia but is less common than CLL. Therefore, based on the patient's age and presentation, CLL is the most likely diagnosis.",9
384,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of infectious mononucleosis, commonly caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The symptoms include fever, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. The development of a rash after taking amoxicillin is also characteristic of EBV infection. The heterophile agglutination test (Monospot test) is used to diagnose EBV infectious mononucleosis. While the patient has risk factors for HIV, the presentation is more consistent with EBV, and the Monospot test is the appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis.",9
386,"Candoxatril is an inhibitor of neprilysin, an endopeptidase that breaks down natriuretic peptides, endothelin, and bradykinin. By inhibiting neprilysin, candoxatril increases the levels of natriuretic peptides, which are vasodilatory mediators released from the heart. These peptides promote sodium excretion and improve cardiac function. The increase in natriuretic peptides is beneficial in heart failure management. However, neprilysin inhibition also increases angiotensin II levels, which can be harmful. Therefore, candoxatril is used with angiotensin receptor blockers to mitigate this effect. The primary effect of this drug regimen is the increase in natriuretic peptides.",9
391,"The patient presents with periorbital edema, hepatomegaly, and lower extremity edema, along with laboratory findings of hypoalbuminemia and proteinuria. These findings suggest nephrotic syndrome. The enlarged liver and kidneys with increased echogenicity, along with the patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis, point towards amyloidosis as the underlying cause. In amyloidosis, amyloid deposits can occur in various organs, including the kidneys, leading to nephrotic syndrome. The characteristic biopsy finding in amyloidosis is apple green birefringence when stained with Congo red under polarized light.",9
393,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with a recent upper respiratory tract infection (fever, sore throat, malaise) followed by hematuria (dark urine) and flank pain. The urinalysis shows hematuria and proteinuria. These findings suggest a glomerular cause of hematuria. The key detail is the timing of the hematuria, which occurs concurrently with the upper respiratory symptoms. This is characteristic of IgA nephropathy (Berger's disease), where IgA deposition in the mesangium of the glomeruli occurs. This condition often presents with hematuria during or shortly after an upper respiratory infection. The other options are less likely given the presentation: 

- A. Inherited abnormalities in type IV collagen are associated with Alport syndrome, which typically presents with hematuria, sensorineural hearing loss, and ocular abnormalities, not acute post-infectious symptoms.
- B. C3 nephritic factor is associated with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, which does not fit the acute presentation here.
- C. Immune complex deposition is more typical of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which usually occurs weeks after a streptococcal infection, not concurrently.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is diffuse mesangial IgA deposition.",9
390,"The patient is an 18-month-old boy with a rash around the eyes and mouth that is itchy and scaly. He also has a history of asthma. The presence of scaly, erythematous skin and the itchiness suggest a chronic inflammatory skin condition. Atopic dermatitis, also known as eczema, is common in children and often associated with a history of atopy, such as asthma. The rash's location and characteristics are consistent with atopic dermatitis, which often affects the face in young children. Viral conjunctivitis would typically involve the eyes more directly with symptoms like redness and discharge, which are not present here. Impetigo would present with honey-colored crusts, not scaly erythematous skin. Scalded skin syndrome would present with more widespread skin involvement and systemic symptoms. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is atopic dermatitis.",9
401,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with Graves' disease, an autoimmune hyperthyroid condition. She has low TSH, elevated free T4 and T3, and positive thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin. The treatment of choice for hyperthyroidism in pregnancy is antithyroid drugs. Methimazole is typically avoided in the first trimester due to teratogenic effects, so propylthiouracil (PTU) is preferred during early pregnancy. Both drugs are thyroid peroxidase inhibitors, which reduce the production of thyroid hormones. Therefore, the best treatment option during pregnancy is the use of thyroid peroxidase inhibitors.",9
396,"The patient's presentation is consistent with acute pyelonephritis, a type of urinary tract infection that has ascended to involve the kidneys. The symptoms of fever, flank pain, chills, and the urinalysis findings (positive leukocyte esterase, nitrites, and blood) support this diagnosis. In acute pyelonephritis, the renal pathology typically shows suppurative inflammation with interstitial neutrophilic infiltration. This is due to the bacterial infection causing an inflammatory response in the renal interstitium. The other options describe findings associated with different renal pathologies: focal and segmental sclerosis is seen in FSGS, mesangial proliferation is seen in conditions like IgA nephropathy, and normal appearing glomeruli might be seen in minimal change disease. Therefore, the most likely finding on renal biopsy in this case is suppurative inflammation with interstitial neutrophilic infiltration.",9
397,"The patient presents with jaundice, agitation, disorientation, asterixis, and epistaxis, which are indicative of liver dysfunction and possible hepatic encephalopathy. The laboratory findings show significantly elevated bilirubin levels and elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), suggesting liver injury. The low TP activity (< 40%) and elevated INR indicate impaired liver synthetic function, consistent with liver failure. The patient's history of high-risk sexual behavior raises the possibility of viral hepatitis, which can lead to fulminant hepatic failure. Hemolytic uremic syndrome typically presents with renal failure, hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia, which are not present here. Ecstasy intoxication and cocaine-abstinence syndrome do not explain the liver dysfunction and jaundice. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is fulminant hepatic failure.",9
395,"The clinical presentation and biopsy findings suggest a diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma, a malignant tumor of smooth muscle origin. The biopsy shows pleomorphic smooth muscle cells with nuclear atypia, which is characteristic of this type of sarcoma. Leiomyosarcomas are known to express markers typical of smooth muscle cells. Desmin is an intermediate filament protein that is a marker for muscle tissue, including smooth muscle. Therefore, a leiomyosarcoma would most strongly stain for desmin. 

Chromogranin is a marker for neuroendocrine tumors, cytokeratin is a marker for epithelial cells, and glial fibrillary acidic protein is a marker for glial cells, none of which are relevant to smooth muscle tumors.",9
402,"The patient developed swelling of the lips, which is indicative of angioedema. Angioedema is a known side effect of ACE inhibitors, such as Lisinopril. This occurs due to the accumulation of bradykinin, which is not broken down because ACE inhibitors block the enzyme that degrades it. Verapamil and Amlodipine are calcium channel blockers and are not typically associated with angioedema. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic and also does not commonly cause angioedema. Therefore, the most likely cause of the lip swelling in this patient is Lisinopril.",9
406,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest pulmonary hypertension. The jugular venous distension, loud split S2, and right heart enlargement on chest X-ray are indicative of increased pressure in the pulmonary circulation. The presence of clubbing and peripheral edema further supports this. To confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, right-heart catheterization is the gold standard as it directly measures pulmonary artery pressures.",9
409,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest a diagnosis of X-linked agammaglobulinemia (Bruton's agammaglobulinemia). This condition is characterized by recurrent bacterial infections due to low levels of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA) and absence of mature B cells (plasma cells). The family history of a maternal uncle who died of an infection supports an X-linked inheritance pattern. The defect in X-linked agammaglobulinemia is in the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) gene, which is crucial for B cell development. BTK is involved in protein phosphorylation, which is essential for B cell maturation and function. Therefore, the protein that is most likely defective in this patient is involved in protein phosphorylation.",9
404,"The clinical presentation of this 5-year-old boy suggests a condition affecting the aorta. The key findings are hypertension in the right upper extremity, diminished femoral pulses, and a systolic murmur heard over the left sternal border and back. These findings are characteristic of coarctation of the aorta, which typically presents with upper extremity hypertension and reduced or delayed femoral pulses due to narrowing of the aorta, usually distal to the left subclavian artery. The systolic murmur and ejection click can be due to turbulent flow across the narrowed segment. Takayasu arteritis is less likely given the age and presentation. Interrupted aortic arch is a more severe congenital defect usually presenting in infancy. Pheochromocytoma typically causes paroxysmal hypertension and other systemic symptoms, not isolated upper extremity hypertension with diminished femoral pulses.",9
417,"The patient presents with chest pain that is squeezing in nature and radiates to the jaw and shoulder, which are classic signs of angina or myocardial ischemia. The pain occurs with exertion (playing tennis, moving furniture) and is relieved by rest, which is typical of stable angina. The patient has risk factors for coronary artery disease, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity (BMI of 30 kg/m2). The absence of symptoms like nausea, vomiting, or sweating does not rule out myocardial ischemia. The physical examination does not reveal any signs of acute distress or other causes of chest pain such as GERD or musculoskeletal pain. Anxiety is less likely given the exertional nature of the pain and the patient's risk factors. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is myocardial ischemia.",9
430,"The patient's age, symptoms, and the location of the tumor are key factors in determining the diagnosis. The patient is a young adult with knee pain that is severe enough to wake him from sleep, and there is swelling and tenderness. The x-ray findings, although not provided here, would typically show a lytic bone lesion in the epiphyseal region of long bones for osteoclastoma (giant cell tumor of bone). This tumor is common in young adults and often affects the knee region. The other options are less likely given the age and typical presentation: Chondrosarcoma is more common in older adults, aneurysmal bone cysts are usually seen in younger patients and have a different radiographic appearance, and Ewing sarcoma typically presents in children and adolescents with systemic symptoms and a different radiographic pattern.",9
418,"The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and prescribed oral diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker. Diltiazem is commonly used to control heart rate in atrial fibrillation. One of the known side effects of calcium channel blockers, including diltiazem, is peripheral edema, particularly bilateral pedal edema. This occurs due to the vasodilatory effects of the drug, which can lead to fluid accumulation in the lower extremities. The other options listed are not typical side effects of diltiazem. Bloody diarrhea, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and multifocal atrial tachycardia are not commonly associated with diltiazem use.",9
424,"The patient presents with worsening asthma, eosinophilia, renal involvement (elevated creatinine, proteinuria, and hematuria), and respiratory symptoms. These findings suggest a systemic vasculitis. The presence of eosinophilia and asthma points towards eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome. EGPA is associated with p-ANCA (perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) levels. The other options are less likely: c-ANCA is associated with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's), IgA deposits are associated with IgA nephropathy, and smoking is not directly related to the systemic vasculitis described here.",9
423,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease (PAD), as indicated by claudication (pain in the calves relieved by rest) and an ABI of 0.89, which suggests mild PAD. The most appropriate initial treatment for PAD, especially with claudication, is a supervised exercise program. This has been shown to improve symptoms and increase walking distance in patients with PAD. Enoxaparin is an anticoagulant and not indicated for PAD. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker and not specifically indicated for PAD treatment. Pedal pumping exercises are not a standard recommendation for PAD. Therefore, the best initial treatment is a referral to a supervised exercise program.",9
433,"The scenario describes a 5-year-old boy with elbow swelling and pain after a fall, suggesting a supracondylar fracture of the humerus, which is common in children. The most concerning complication of this type of fracture is injury to the brachial artery, which can lead to absent radial pulse due to compromised blood flow. This is a critical complication that needs to be addressed promptly to prevent ischemia and potential Volkmann's contracture. Other options like avascular necrosis of the humeral head and adhesive capsulitis are not typical complications of this injury. Polymicrobial infection is not relevant in this context as there is no indication of an open fracture or wound.",9
434,"The clinical presentation and genetic findings in this case are indicative of a lysosomal storage disorder. The key detail is the failure to phosphorylate mannose residues on glycoproteins, which is a hallmark of Inclusion cell (I-cell) disease. This condition is caused by a defect in the enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase, leading to improper targeting of lysosomal enzymes. As a result, these enzymes are secreted outside the cell instead of being directed to the lysosome, causing the accumulation of undegraded substrates within the cell. The symptoms of coarse facial features, stiff joints, clouded corneas, and developmental delay align with I-cell disease. The other options do not match the specific biochemical defect or clinical presentation described.",9
435,"Atypical glandular cells (AGC) on a Pap smear can indicate a range of potential issues, including precancerous or cancerous conditions of the cervix or endometrium. Given the patient's age and the presence of AGC, it is important to evaluate both the cervix and the endometrium to rule out significant pathology. The most comprehensive approach is to perform colposcopy with endocervical and endometrial sampling to assess for any abnormalities in these areas. This approach ensures that both cervical and endometrial sources of atypical cells are evaluated, which is crucial given the potential for serious underlying conditions.",9
444,"The patient's symptoms are suggestive of Meniere's disease, characterized by episodes of vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss. The audiometry findings of low- and high-frequency sensory loss with normal mid-frequency hearing are consistent with this diagnosis. The initial management of Meniere's disease often involves lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes such as reducing caffeine and salt intake, to help manage fluid balance in the inner ear. Therefore, reducing caffeine intake is an appropriate initial step in management.",9
414,"The patient presents with symptoms of pain and tingling in the thumb, index, and middle fingers, along with thenar eminence atrophy, which are characteristic of carpal tunnel syndrome. This condition is caused by compression of the median nerve. The symptoms being worse in the morning and waking up at night further support this diagnosis, as these are common features of carpal tunnel syndrome. The median nerve innervates the thenar muscles and provides sensation to the thumb, index, middle, and part of the ring finger. The physical exam shows pain reproduction with wrist flexion, consistent with the Phalen's test for carpal tunnel syndrome. Therefore, the nerve affected is the median nerve.",9
443,"This patient presents with symptoms and lab findings suggestive of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). She has hypercalcemia, low phosphorus, and elevated parathyroid hormone levels, indicating primary hyperparathyroidism. The presence of peptic ulcers and diarrhea suggests a gastrinoma, which is part of the MEN1 syndrome. Her history of infertility treated with bromocriptine suggests a prolactinoma, another component of MEN1. The combination of hyperparathyroidism, pituitary tumors, and pancreatic endocrine tumors (such as gastrinomas) is characteristic of MEN1, which is caused by mutations in the MEN1 gene.",9
442,"In this scenario, the patient has recovered from a previous hepatitis B infection. During and after recovery from hepatitis B, the presence of antibodies against the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) is common. The immunoglobulin subtype that binds to the hepatitis B core antigen is IgG, which is indicative of past infection and recovery. IgG antibodies are known to exist as monomers. Therefore, the characteristic of the immunoglobulin subtype that most likely binds to the hepatitis B core antigen in this patient is that it exists as a monomer.",9
445,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), characterized by abdominal pain, neuropsychiatric symptoms (such as confusion and hallucinations), and peripheral neuropathy. The patient's recent alcohol consumption and fasting (suggested by not having a bowel movement) could have precipitated the attack. In AIP, there is a deficiency in the enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase, leading to an accumulation of porphyrin precursors. The management of an acute attack involves the administration of hemin, which helps to downregulate the hepatic synthesis of porphyrins by providing negative feedback to the heme synthesis pathway. Glucose can also be used as it helps to suppress porphyrin synthesis, but hemin is more specific and effective for acute attacks. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is hemin therapy.",9
453,"In a patient with long-standing hypertension, the heart has to work harder to pump blood against the increased systemic vascular resistance. This increased workload leads to adaptive changes in the heart muscle, particularly the left ventricle. The most common change is left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), which is characterized by an increase in the size of the cardiac muscle cells (myocytes). This hypertrophy is a compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output despite the increased afterload. Therefore, the echocardiographic changes in the left ventricle are most likely due to an increase in cardiac cell size.",9
454,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with hyperthyroidism, likely due to Graves' disease or another form of thyrotoxicosis. In hyperthyroidism, there is an increase in circulating thyroid hormones (T3 and T4), which leads to a decrease in TSH due to negative feedback. These thyroid hormones increase the metabolic rate and have significant effects on the cardiovascular system.

One of the key cardiovascular effects of excess thyroid hormones is the increased sensitivity of the heart to catecholamines. This is primarily due to the increased sensitivity of ß1-adrenergic receptors in the heart, which leads to increased heart rate (tachycardia), increased contractility, and other symptoms such as palpitations and chest pain. This increased sensitivity is not due to an increase in the number of receptors, but rather an increased responsiveness of these receptors to catecholamines.

Therefore, the pathophysiologic mechanism contributing to the cardiovascular symptoms in this patient is the increased sensitivity of ß1-adrenergic receptors.",9
457,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of a myeloproliferative disorder. The key findings include splenomegaly, teardrop-shaped RBCs, nucleated RBCs, and immature myeloid cells in the peripheral blood smear. The bone marrow is difficult to aspirate, which is indicative of fibrosis. These findings are characteristic of primary myelofibrosis. 

The negative TRAP test rules out hairy cell leukemia, and the negative cytogenetic analysis for the Philadelphia chromosome rules out chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). 

Primary myelofibrosis is often associated with a mutation in the JAK2 gene, specifically JAK2 V617F, which is present in approximately 50-60% of cases. 

Therefore, the most likely laboratory finding in this patient is a JAK-2 mutation.",9
460,"The patient's symptoms and the chest x-ray findings suggest a lung abscess, likely due to aspiration pneumonia. The foul-smelling, dark red, gelatinous sputum is characteristic of Klebsiella pneumoniae, a gram-negative rod known for causing such infections, especially in individuals with risk factors like smoking and alcohol use. Klebsiella pneumoniae is known for its thick polysaccharide capsule, which is a major virulence factor. This capsule helps the bacteria evade phagocytosis and contributes to its pathogenicity in lung infections.",9
469,"The patient's symptoms of severe headaches, flushing, and hypertension suggest a pheochromocytoma, a tumor that secretes catecholamines. The optimal treatment for pheochromocytoma is surgical removal of the tumor. However, before surgery, it is crucial to control blood pressure and prevent hypertensive crises. This is typically done by administering an alpha-adrenergic blocker. Phenoxybenzamine is a noncompetitive, irreversible alpha-adrenergic blocker that is used to manage hypertension in pheochromocytoma patients prior to surgery. Phentolamine is a competitive alpha blocker, but the question specifically asks for a noncompetitive inhibitor, making phenoxybenzamine the correct choice.",9
461,"The patient is a 16-year-old girl with severe acne that has not responded to previous treatments. She is sexually active with inconsistent condom use, which raises the possibility of pregnancy. Isotretinoin is a common treatment for severe acne, but it is teratogenic and requires confirmation that the patient is not pregnant before initiation. Therefore, measuring serum beta-hCG levels is necessary to rule out pregnancy before considering treatments like isotretinoin or other medications that could affect a potential pregnancy.",9
471,"The patient's symptoms of headache, increased sweating, palpitations, nausea, fever, altered mental status, tremors, and hyperreflexia are suggestive of serotonin syndrome. This condition is caused by increased serotonergic activity in the central nervous system. The recent change in her medication from citalopram (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) to venlafaxine (a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) could have led to an accumulation of serotonin, especially since she stopped citalopram only three days ago. The combination or overlap of these medications can increase serotonin levels, leading to serotonin syndrome. The symptoms and recent medication history align with this diagnosis.",9
474,"The patient presents with right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, and mild scleral icterus, suggesting a biliary issue. Her lab results show elevated alkaline phosphatase and direct hyperbilirubinemia, indicating possible biliary obstruction. The most appropriate initial diagnostic test for suspected gallstones or biliary obstruction is a transabdominal ultrasound. This non-invasive test can identify gallstones, biliary duct dilation, and other abnormalities in the gallbladder and biliary tree. ERCP is more invasive and typically used for therapeutic purposes or when ultrasound findings are inconclusive. A HIDA scan is used to assess gallbladder function, particularly in suspected acute cholecystitis, but is not the first step in this scenario. Abdominal X-rays are not useful for diagnosing gallstones or biliary obstruction.",9
479,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with Sheehan's syndrome, which is postpartum pituitary gland failure due to significant blood loss and hypovolemic shock during or after childbirth. The key features include decreased milk production (due to low prolactin), fatigue, low blood pressure, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and low thyroid hormone levels. These symptoms suggest a deficiency in multiple pituitary hormones, indicating pituitary dysfunction. The history of severe postpartum hemorrhage supports the diagnosis of pituitary ischemia, as the pituitary gland is particularly vulnerable to ischemic damage during periods of significant blood loss.",9
484,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), characterized by hyperglycemia, acidosis, and electrolyte imbalances. The treatment involves IV fluids and insulin. Insulin facilitates the uptake of glucose into cells, reducing serum glucose levels. It also drives potassium into cells, leading to a decrease in serum potassium. The acidosis (low pH and bicarbonate) will improve with insulin and fluid therapy, leading to an increase in pH and bicarbonate levels. Therefore, after treatment, a decrease in serum potassium is expected due to insulin's effect on cellular uptake of potassium.",9
476,"The patient presents with syncope and a telemetry finding of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with cyclic alteration of the QRS axis, which is characteristic of Torsades de Pointes (TdP). TdP is often associated with a prolonged QT interval. The patient's medication list includes methadone, which is known to cause QT interval prolongation. Although hypomagnesemia can also lead to TdP, the question states that serum electrolyte concentrations are normal, ruling out hypomagnesemia as a cause. Prinzmetal angina and Brugada syndrome are not consistent with the presentation of TdP. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's syncope is a prolonged QT interval due to methadone use.",9
485,"The patient presents with acute kidney injury (AKI) as evidenced by the rise in creatinine from 0.9 mg/dL to 2.1 mg/dL over 48 hours. The clinical scenario suggests acute tubular necrosis (ATN), likely due to sepsis from diverticulitis and possibly nephrotoxic effects of medications or decreased renal perfusion. The presence of muddy brown casts in the urine is characteristic of ATN, which is the most common cause of intrinsic renal failure in hospitalized patients. Other types of casts, such as hyaline casts, are nonspecific and can be seen in prerenal azotemia, waxy casts are associated with chronic kidney disease, and white blood cell casts are indicative of interstitial nephritis or pyelonephritis. Given the acute nature and the clinical context, muddy brown casts are the most likely finding.",9
489,"The clinical scenario suggests possible elder abuse, given the patient's lethargy, weakness, lack of eye contact, and unexplained bruises. The normal lab results and imaging make a medical cause less likely. Before making any reports or accusations, it's crucial to gather more information in a safe environment for the patient. Asking the son to leave the room allows the healthcare provider to speak to the patient privately, which may help the patient feel more comfortable disclosing any abuse or concerns about her home situation. This step is essential before taking further actions such as reporting to authorities.",9
473,"The patient's mechanism of injury and symptoms suggest a rotator cuff injury. The inability to initiate abduction of the shoulder, but being able to complete it with assistance, points towards an issue with the supraspinatus muscle. The supraspinatus is responsible for the initial 15 degrees of shoulder abduction. Once the arm is abducted past this point, the deltoid muscle takes over. The lack of sensory loss and normal pulses suggest that there is no nerve or vascular injury. The MRI would likely show a tear or injury to the supraspinatus tendon, which is the most common rotator cuff injury and fits the clinical presentation.",9
486,"The patient presents with lethargy, confusion, and severe hyponatremia (serum Na+ 115 mEq/L). The history of smoking and the presence of a central lung mass on chest x-ray suggest the possibility of small cell lung cancer, which is often associated with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). The laboratory findings support SIADH: low serum sodium, low serum osmolality, high urine osmolality, and high urine sodium. In cases of severe symptomatic hyponatremia, the immediate management involves correcting the sodium level to prevent complications such as seizures or coma. The most appropriate and rapid way to increase serum sodium in this acute setting is the administration of hypertonic saline. Other options like demeclocycline are used for chronic management and are not suitable for acute correction. Furosemide can be used in conjunction with hypertonic saline in some cases but is not the primary immediate treatment. A CT scan of the chest is not urgent in this context as the immediate concern is the severe hyponatremia.",9
496,"The patient is experiencing contractions that are infrequent, mild, and have not led to cervical changes, indicating that she is likely experiencing Braxton Hicks contractions rather than true labor. True labor would typically involve regular, increasing contractions that lead to cervical effacement and dilation. The fetal heart rate is reassuring, and there are no signs of complications. Given these findings, the most appropriate management is to reassure the patient and discharge her, as she is not in active labor.",9
493,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is characterized by both upper and lower motor neuron signs. The patient exhibits hyperreflexia and spasticity (upper motor neuron signs) as well as fasciculations and muscle atrophy (lower motor neuron signs). Tongue fasciculations and the absence of sensory loss further support this diagnosis. In ALS, muscle biopsy typically shows evidence of denervation and reinnervation due to the loss of motor neurons. This is reflected in option C, which describes the typical findings in ALS muscle biopsy.",9
490,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of a urinary tract infection. The key symptoms include fever, chills, nausea, urinary urgency, and frequency, along with costovertebral angle tenderness, which is indicative of kidney involvement. The urinalysis shows positive nitrites and leukocyte esterase, many bacteria, and a high white blood cell count, all of which are consistent with a UTI. However, the presence of fever, chills, and costovertebral angle tenderness suggests an upper urinary tract infection, specifically pyelonephritis, rather than a lower urinary tract infection like cystitis. The patient's vital signs, including fever and tachypnea, further support a more severe infection such as pyelonephritis. The white blood cell count is within normal limits, but the clinical presentation is more indicative of pyelonephritis rather than uncomplicated cystitis or a simple UTI. Acute obstructing nephrolithiasis would typically present with severe flank pain and hematuria, which are not noted here.",9
500,"The newborn presents with feeding intolerance and bilious vomiting shortly after birth, which suggests an intestinal obstruction. The physical examination reveals features consistent with Down syndrome (epicanthus, upward slanting of the eyelids, low-set ears, single transverse palmar crease). Down syndrome is associated with several gastrointestinal anomalies, including duodenal atresia. The abdominal examination shows a distended upper abdomen and a concave-shaped lower abdomen, which is characteristic of duodenal atresia due to the 'double bubble' sign seen on x-ray. The presence of a holosystolic murmur could indicate a congenital heart defect, which is also common in Down syndrome. Given these findings, duodenal atresia is the most likely diagnosis.",9
503,"The clinical presentation of the 4-year-old boy suggests a condition characterized by short stature, disproportionate limb shortening, and a prominent forehead, with normal intelligence. These features are indicative of achondroplasia, a common form of dwarfism. Achondroplasia is caused by a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. This mutation leads to abnormal cartilage formation, particularly affecting the long bones, resulting in the characteristic short limbs and normal trunk size. The other options do not match the clinical presentation: Alpha-1 type I collagen mutations are associated with osteogenesis imperfecta, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor mutations are linked to growth issues but not with the specific features described, and Runt-related transcription factor 2 mutations are associated with cleidocranial dysplasia.",9
502,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a diagnosis of reactive arthritis, which is characterized by the triad of urethritis, conjunctivitis, and arthritis. This condition often follows an infection, such as a gastrointestinal or genitourinary infection, which aligns with the patient's recent episode of diarrhea. Reactive arthritis is strongly associated with the HLA-B27 haplotype. The other options are associated with different conditions: HLA-DR4 is linked to rheumatoid arthritis, anti-CCP antibodies are also associated with rheumatoid arthritis, and anti-centromere antibodies are linked to limited scleroderma (CREST syndrome). Therefore, the most likely association for this patient's condition is the HLA-B27 haplotype.",10
516,"The patient presents with sudden onset of double vision and headache, along with ptosis and the right eye being deviated down and out. These symptoms are indicative of an oculomotor nerve (CN III) palsy. The oculomotor nerve is responsible for most of the eye's movements, eyelid elevation (levator palpebrae superioris), and pupil constriction. In this case, the ptosis and the 'down and out' position of the eye suggest that the muscles innervated by CN III are not functioning properly. The trochlear nerve (CN IV) controls the superior oblique muscle, which would cause difficulty looking down and in, not the symptoms described. The abducens nerve (CN VI) controls the lateral rectus muscle, which would cause inability to abduct the eye, not the 'down and out' position. The facial nerve (CN VII) controls facial expressions and does not affect eye movement. Given the patient's history of poorly controlled diabetes, a microvascular ischemic event affecting the oculomotor nerve is a likely cause of these symptoms.",9

508,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), likely an inferior wall myocardial infarction (MI), given the bradycardia (pulse of 56/min) and hypotension (blood pressure of 100/70 mm Hg). The cold skin and pale appearance suggest decreased perfusion, possibly due to reduced cardiac output. In cases of inferior MI, especially when accompanied by hypotension, it is important to consider right ventricular involvement, which can lead to reduced preload. In such cases, the administration of intravenous fluids, such as a normal saline bolus, is appropriate to increase preload and improve cardiac output. Nitroglycerin is typically avoided in hypotensive patients, especially with suspected right ventricular MI, as it can further reduce preload and worsen hypotension. Morphine is not indicated as the next step in this scenario, and phenylephrine, a vasoconstrictor, is not appropriate as it can increase afterload and worsen cardiac function in this context. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to administer a normal saline bolus to address the hypotension and improve perfusion.",9
519,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), an autosomal dominant disorder. In autosomal dominant inheritance, an affected individual has a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to each offspring. Since the patient is affected and her husband is healthy, each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease.",9
522,"The medication described in the scenario is aspirin, which irreversibly inhibits the synthesis of thromboxane A2 and prostaglandins by acetylating cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. Aspirin is commonly used for its antiplatelet effects, especially in patients with cardiovascular issues. One of the most common adverse effects of aspirin is gastrointestinal (GI) irritation, which can lead to GI bleeding or hemorrhage. This is due to the inhibition of prostaglandins that protect the gastric mucosa. While tinnitus can also occur with aspirin, especially at higher doses, GI hemorrhage is a more common and serious adverse effect associated with its use.",9
524,"The patient presents with acute abdominal pain, maroon-colored stools, and a history of atrial fibrillation, which suggests a possible embolic event. The absence of bowel sounds and diffuse tenderness indicate a serious abdominal condition, possibly ischemic in nature. Given his atrial fibrillation and use of dabigatran, a cardiac thromboembolism leading to mesenteric ischemia is a likely cause. This condition can cause bowel necrosis and bleeding, explaining the maroon-colored stools. The history of diverticular disease is less likely to cause such acute symptoms and widespread tenderness. Therefore, the most likely cause is a cardiac thromboembolism leading to mesenteric ischemia.",9
526,"In melanoma, the most important prognostic factor is the depth of invasion of atypical cells, also known as the Breslow thickness. This measurement indicates how deeply the melanoma cells have penetrated into the skin and is directly correlated with the likelihood of metastasis and overall prognosis. While other factors such as the evolution of the lesion, age at presentation, and border irregularity can provide additional information, they are not as critical in determining the prognosis as the depth of invasion.",9
529,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest a platelet function disorder. The key findings are thrombocytopenia, prolonged bleeding time, and lack of response to ristocetin on platelet aggregation studies, which was not corrected with normal plasma. This is indicative of Bernard-Soulier syndrome, which is characterized by a deficiency of the GpIb receptor on platelets. GpIb is necessary for platelet adhesion to the von Willebrand factor, and its deficiency leads to the symptoms observed. The normal aggregation response with ADP indicates that the GpIIb/IIIa complex is functioning normally, ruling out Glanzmann thrombasthenia. Therefore, the most likely true statement about this patient's condition is that there is a decreased GpIb.",9
531,"The patient's symptoms of dry mouth and dry eyes, along with enlarged lymph nodes, suggest Sjögren's syndrome. Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disorder characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands, leading to xerostomia (dry mouth) and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes). The lymphadenopathy in Sjögren's syndrome is typically due to reactive lymphadenitis. The most common pattern of lymphadenitis associated with Sjögren's syndrome is follicular hyperplasia, which is due to the proliferation of B cells in the lymph nodes.",9
532,"The patient has a history of breast cancer and now presents with a solitary brain mass, which is likely a metastasis given her cancer history. The mass is causing symptoms such as headaches, likely due to increased intracranial pressure and edema. In cases of solitary brain metastasis, especially when the mass is accessible and the patient is symptomatic, surgical resection is often the preferred initial step. This approach can provide immediate relief of symptoms, allow for histological diagnosis, and potentially improve survival. Other options like chemotherapy and irradiation might be considered after surgical intervention, but they are not the most immediate step in this scenario. Seizure prophylaxis and palliative care are supportive measures but do not address the underlying cause of the symptoms directly.",9
533,"The patient presents with progressive weakness, fatigue that improves with rest, and ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelids), which are classic symptoms of myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by antibodies against the acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle weakness. The treatment that is most effective for myasthenia gravis involves increasing the availability of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction to improve muscle contraction. This is achieved by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme responsible for breaking down acetylcholine. Therefore, the mechanism of action that is most likely to be effective in this case is the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase.",9
534,"The question involves understanding the physiological adaptations that contribute to increased heart rate during exercise. In normal mice, a higher heart rate is observed compared to genetically modified mice. The options provided relate to structural and functional aspects of cardiomyocytes.

A. Greater cardiomyocyte size - Larger cardiomyocytes might contribute to stronger contractions but not necessarily to a higher heart rate.

B. Greater ratio of heart to body weight - This could indicate a larger heart relative to body size, potentially affecting stroke volume but not directly explaining a higher heart rate.

C. Lower number of gap junctions - Gap junctions facilitate electrical conduction between cardiomyocytes. Fewer gap junctions would likely slow down conduction, potentially reducing heart rate, not increasing it.

D. Greater T-tubule density - T-tubules are involved in the rapid transmission of action potentials and efficient calcium handling, which are crucial for quick and coordinated contractions. Increased T-tubule density would enhance the heart's ability to respond quickly to increased demands, such as during exercise, leading to a higher heart rate.

Given these considerations, the most likely explanation for the increased heart rate in normal mice is greater T-tubule density, which facilitates rapid and efficient cardiac excitation-contraction coupling.",9
537,"During pregnancy, physiological changes occur that can affect kidney function. One such change is an increase in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which can lead to glucosuria. The kidneys filter more blood, and as a result, more glucose is filtered. If the amount of glucose exceeds the renal threshold for reabsorption, it can appear in the urine as glucosuria. This is a common and benign finding in pregnancy and does not necessarily indicate diabetes or decreased insulin sensitivity. The patient's serum glucose level is not significantly elevated, and there is no indication of decreased insulin production or increased permeability of the glomerular filtration barrier. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the glucosuria in this pregnant patient is the increased GFR.",9
536,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of septic arthritis, likely due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae, given the Gram-negative diplococci found in the synovial fluid. The symptoms of bilateral joint pain, morning stiffness, and night sweats could initially suggest rheumatoid arthritis, but the acute presentation with fever and a single joint being severely affected points towards an infectious cause. Gonococcal arthritis can lead to joint space narrowing and bone erosions if not treated promptly. The x-ray finding most consistent with this condition would be joint space narrowing and bone erosions due to the inflammatory process and potential damage to the joint structures.",9
538,"The clinical presentation of the 10-month-old boy suggests a primary immunodeficiency disorder. The key points in the case are recurrent infections, particularly with catalase-positive organisms like Burkholderia cepacia, and the increased levels of immunoglobulins. The negative chloride sweat test rules out cystic fibrosis. The elevated leukocyte count with a high percentage of neutrophils and the presence of normochromic normocytic anemia are also noted.

The recurrent infections with catalase-positive organisms and the specific mention of Burkholderia cepacia are highly suggestive of Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD). CGD is characterized by a defect in the respiratory burst of neutrophils due to a deficiency in NADPH oxidase. This defect leads to an inability to kill certain bacteria and fungi, resulting in recurrent infections with organisms like Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, Nocardia, and Burkholderia cepacia.

Given these considerations, the most likely defect of neutrophil function responsible for this patient's condition is an absent respiratory burst, which is consistent with CGD.",9
541,"The patient is a 50-year-old man with a history of smoking. According to the USPSTF guidelines, screening for colorectal cancer is recommended starting at age 45 for average-risk individuals. Colonoscopy is a common method for colorectal cancer screening. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing for prostate cancer is not universally recommended and is based on individual decision-making. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is not used for screening but rather for monitoring colorectal cancer. Abdominal ultrasonography for abdominal aortic aneurysm is recommended for men aged 65 to 75 who have ever smoked, not at age 50. Therefore, the recommended screening test for this patient is a colonoscopy for colorectal cancer.",9
545,"The patient's symptoms and lab findings suggest polycythemia vera (PV), a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by increased red blood cell mass. The key symptoms include facial flushing, pruritus after showering (aquagenic pruritus), and headaches. The palpable abdominal mass could be splenomegaly, which is common in PV. The elevated hemoglobin level (18.2 g/dL) supports the diagnosis of polycythemia. 

In PV, the most common underlying cause is a mutation in the JAK2 tyrosine kinase (JAK2 V617F mutation), which leads to constitutive activation of the erythropoietin receptor, causing increased red blood cell production independent of erythropoietin levels. 

A. Fibrosis of bone marrow is associated with myelofibrosis, not PV.
B. Tyrosine kinase mutation (JAK2) is characteristic of PV.
C. BCR-ABL fusion is associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), not PV.
D. Chronic hypoxemia would lead to secondary polycythemia, but the normal O2 saturation and presentation are more consistent with PV.

Therefore, the most likely cause of his presentation is a tyrosine kinase mutation.",9
549,"The patient is a 23-year-old woman at 36 weeks' gestation who is HIV positive with a viral load of 11,000 copies/mL. The goal in managing an HIV-positive pregnant woman is to reduce the risk of vertical transmission of HIV to the baby. The standard approach is to start combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) to reduce the viral load. If the viral load is above 1,000 copies/mL near delivery, a cesarean delivery is recommended to further reduce the risk of transmission. Since the patient is at 36 weeks, starting cART immediately and scheduling a cesarean delivery at 38 weeks is the most appropriate management to allow time for the medication to reduce the viral load and to plan for a cesarean delivery to minimize transmission risk.",9
548,"The patient's symptoms suggest intoxication with a substance that causes paranoia, anxiety, tachycardia, hypertension, dry mucous membranes, and conjunctival injection. These symptoms are consistent with cannabis use. Cannabis intoxication is known to cause impaired reaction time, which aligns with the patient's presentation. Other options like tactile hallucinations are more associated with cocaine or amphetamine use, pupillary constriction is typical of opioid use, and synesthesia is associated with hallucinogens like LSD. Therefore, the most likely finding in this scenario is impaired reaction time due to cannabis intoxication.",9
551,"The patient's symptoms of flushing, tachycardia, hypotension, and vomiting after consuming alcohol suggest a disulfiram-like reaction. This reaction is commonly associated with the antibiotic metronidazole, which is used to treat Helicobacter pylori infections, often found in patients with a positive urea breath test. Metronidazole works by forming toxic metabolites that damage bacterial DNA, leading to its antimicrobial effects. The disulfiram-like reaction occurs because metronidazole inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase, leading to the accumulation of acetaldehyde when alcohol is consumed.",9
557,"The question involves the breakdown of sucrose into glucose and fructose by a gut enzyme. The goal is to maintain a glucose meter reading of 0 mg/dL, indicating no glucose formation. Acarbose is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor that works by inhibiting enzymes in the gut that break down carbohydrates into glucose. By inhibiting the enzyme responsible for breaking down sucrose, acarbose would prevent the formation of glucose, maintaining a reading of 0 mg/dL. Glyburide and exenatide are not relevant as they affect insulin secretion and action, not carbohydrate breakdown. Metformin primarily affects hepatic glucose production and insulin sensitivity, not the enzymatic breakdown of carbohydrates in the gut.",9
555,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of a condition known as mycosis fungoides, which is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The key features include a pruritic rash, weight loss, and the biopsy findings of neoplastic cells with cerebriform nuclei within the epidermis. These cerebriform nuclei are characteristic of atypical T cells. Mycosis fungoides involves the proliferation of malignant T cells that infiltrate the skin, leading to the described symptoms and biopsy findings.",9
564,"The patient's presentation is consistent with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, which involves an accessory pathway (the bundle of Kent) that can lead to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. In WPW, the characteristic ECG finding is a slurred upstroke of the QRS complex, known as a delta wave, due to pre-excitation of the ventricles. This is because the accessory pathway allows impulses to bypass the AV node, leading to early depolarization of the ventricles. The use of verapamil in this setting can be dangerous as it may enhance conduction through the accessory pathway, leading to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death, which explains the patient's outcome.",9
561,"The patient's symptoms and background suggest a possible case of constrictive pericarditis, which can occur due to tuberculosis, especially in individuals from regions where TB is endemic, such as Haiti. The symptoms of exertional dyspnea, orthopnea (difficulty lying flat), and a history of fever, night sweats, and cough align with this diagnosis. In constrictive pericarditis, the heart is encased in a rigid pericardium, leading to impaired filling of the heart during diastole. A classic physical exam finding in constrictive pericarditis is Kussmaul's sign, which is the paradoxical rise in jugular venous pressure on inspiration. This is due to the inability of the heart to accommodate increased venous return during inspiration. Therefore, the most likely finding upon further evaluation would be jugular venous distention on inspiration.",9
565,"The patient's symptoms and chest X-ray findings are suggestive of atypical pneumonia, likely caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae, given the diffuse interstitial infiltrates and the growth of colonies resembling fried eggs on a specialized medium. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of atypical pneumonia in young adults and does not have a cell wall, making it resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics like ceftriaxone and amoxicillin. The appropriate treatment for Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a macrolide antibiotic, such as azithromycin, which targets the organism effectively. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to start oral azithromycin.",9
559,"The patient presents with acute hepatitis, as indicated by the elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) and bilirubin levels. The presence of Hepatitis B core IgM antibody and the absence of Hepatitis B surface antigen suggest an acute Hepatitis B infection. The Hepatitis C antibody is positive, but the RNA is negative, indicating a past infection or resolved Hepatitis C. The management of acute Hepatitis B is primarily supportive, as most adults clear the infection spontaneously. Antiviral therapy is not typically indicated unless there is evidence of fulminant hepatic failure or severe, protracted disease, which is not the case here. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is supportive therapy.",9
376,"The patient received the influenza vaccine, which is designed to protect against specific strains of the virus. However, the influenza virus is known for its ability to undergo antigenic drift, which involves random point mutations in the viral genome, particularly in the genes encoding surface proteins like hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. These mutations can lead to changes in the virus's surface antigens, allowing it to evade the immune response generated by the vaccine. This is why the patient can still get infected despite being vaccinated. Antigenic shift, which involves reassortment of genome segments, is not applicable here as it leads to major changes and pandemics, not the seasonal variation seen in this case.",9
142,"The patient is presenting with signs of postpartum endometritis, which is characterized by fever, uterine tenderness, and foul-smelling lochia. The most significant risk factor for postpartum endometritis is a cesarean delivery, especially after the onset of labor. In this case, the patient had a C-section after labor had begun, which increases the risk of infection due to the prolonged exposure of the uterine cavity to potential pathogens. While prolonged rupture of membranes is also a risk factor, the fact that the C-section was performed after labor had started is more significant in this context. Her history of herpes simplex virus and maternal diabetes are less directly related to the development of endometritis in this scenario.",9
349,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs highly suggestive of an aortic dissection, particularly a traumatic one given the context of a high-speed motor vehicle collision. The tearing chest pain, differential blood pressures in the arms, absent pulses in the right leg, and a widened mediastinum on chest X-ray are classic indicators of an aortic dissection. Rib fracture, myocardial rupture, and diaphragmatic rupture do not typically present with these specific findings. Rib fractures would cause localized pain and possibly pneumothorax, myocardial rupture would likely lead to cardiac tamponade or sudden death, and diaphragmatic rupture would present with respiratory distress and bowel sounds in the thorax. Therefore, the most likely etiology is traumatic aortic dissection.",9
270,"The patient is experiencing symptoms consistent with an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction, which is characterized by fever, flank pain, hemoglobinuria (dark brown urine), and hypotension. This type of reaction is typically due to ABO incompatibility or other alloantibodies against red blood cell antigens. The direct Coombs test (direct antiglobulin test) is used to detect antibodies or complement proteins attached to the surface of red blood cells, which would be positive in the case of an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction. This test helps confirm the presence of antibodies causing hemolysis of the transfused red blood cells.",9
446,"The child in the vignette presents with features suggestive of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), which includes macrosomia, omphalocele, macroglossia, and hemihypertrophy. BWS is a genetic disorder that increases the risk of certain embryonal tumors, particularly Wilms tumor (nephroblastoma) and hepatoblastoma. The hemihypertrophy and macroglossia are classic features of BWS, and the family history of a relative with similar symptoms supports a genetic condition. Among the options provided, Wilms tumor is the most closely associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.",9
412,"The patient is in a critical condition following a motor vehicle collision, with signs of significant trauma to the chest and abdomen, and an open femur fracture. His vital signs indicate tachycardia (pulse of 150/min) and borderline hypotension (BP 104/74 mmHg), suggesting possible shock, likely due to internal bleeding given the abdominal distension and tenderness. His Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is low, indicating a decreased level of consciousness (does not open eyes, withdraws to pain, makes incomprehensible sounds). This low GCS score (approximately 6) suggests a need for airway protection. In trauma patients, especially with a low GCS, securing the airway is a priority to prevent aspiration and ensure adequate ventilation. Therefore, the best initial step in management is intubation to secure the airway.",9
499,"The patient is exhibiting symptoms consistent with a manic episode, including grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, increased goal-directed activity, and distractibility. These symptoms have been present for about a week, which aligns with the criteria for a manic episode in bipolar disorder. The positive hCG indicates pregnancy, which is a critical factor in choosing the appropriate treatment. Lithium is typically used to treat acute mania, but it is contraindicated in pregnancy due to the risk of teratogenic effects, particularly cardiac anomalies. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is safe and effective for treating severe mania during pregnancy. Fluoxetine is an antidepressant and not appropriate for acute mania. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic that can be used to manage acute mania and is considered safer than lithium during pregnancy. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management for this pregnant patient with acute mania is haloperidol.",9
456,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of a myeloproliferative disorder. The key findings include leukocytosis with a left shift (presence of immature myeloid cells), thrombocytosis, and splenomegaly. The differential diagnosis includes chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which is characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (BCR-ABL fusion gene). The next step in management should be to confirm the diagnosis of CML. Cytogenetic studies, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are used to detect the BCR-ABL fusion gene. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to perform cytogenetic studies.",9
570,"The patient is a 49-year-old woman with several risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including hypertension, type II diabetes, obesity, and a history of smoking. Her LDL cholesterol level is 130 mg/dL, which is above the optimal level for someone with her risk factors. According to current guidelines, patients with diabetes aged 40-75 should be on statin therapy regardless of their LDL levels, especially if they have additional risk factors. While mammograms are recommended for women starting at age 50, and colonoscopy is recommended starting at age 50 as well, the most immediate intervention to reduce cardiovascular risk in this patient is to initiate statin therapy. Chest radiography is not indicated in this scenario as there are no respiratory symptoms or specific indications for a chest X-ray.",9
578,"The patient's symptoms and urinalysis findings are indicative of a urinary tract infection (UTI). The presence of fever, chills, and lower quadrant abdominal pain suggests a more severe infection, possibly pyelonephritis. The urinalysis shows a high number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and significant bacteriuria, which are typical findings in UTIs.

The most common cause of UTIs, especially in young women, is Escherichia coli, which is a gram-negative rod-shaped bacillus. This aligns with option C. Other options describe organisms that are not typically associated with UTIs:

- Option A describes nonmotile, pleomorphic rod-shaped, gram-negative bacilli, which could refer to organisms like Klebsiella, but E. coli is more common.
- Option B describes pear-shaped motile protozoa, which is characteristic of Trichomonas vaginalis, a cause of vaginitis, not UTIs.
- Option D describes gram-positive cocci that grow in chains, which are characteristic of Streptococcus species, not the most common cause of UTIs.

Therefore, the most likely microorganism responsible for this patient's condition is a gram-negative rod-shaped bacillus, specifically E. coli.",9
579,"The patient presents with sudden onset back pain, jaundice, and dark urine after starting isoniazid for latent tuberculosis. The laboratory findings show anemia with low haptoglobin and elevated indirect bilirubin, suggesting hemolytic anemia. The urine shows blood without significant RBCs, indicating hemoglobinuria. These findings are consistent with hemolysis. The key detail is the recent start of isoniazid, which can precipitate hemolysis in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. G6PD deficiency leads to a lack of reduced glutathione, making red blood cells more susceptible to oxidative stress and hemolysis. This matches the clinical picture and laboratory findings.",9
497,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a cardiac arrhythmia, given her history of fainting, palpitations, and chest pain. Her ECG findings would be crucial to identify the specific type of arrhythmia. However, based on the options provided, we need to consider the most common conditions associated with these medications. Flecainide and procainamide are antiarrhythmic drugs used for specific types of tachyarrhythmias. Magnesium sulfate is often used in cases of torsades de pointes, a type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, especially when associated with prolonged QT interval or hypomagnesemia. Calcium gluconate is typically used for hyperkalemia or hypocalcemia, not directly for arrhythmias. Given the symptoms and the options, the most likely scenario is that the patient is experiencing torsades de pointes, which aligns with magnesium sulfate as the first-line treatment.",9
580,"The patient is a 69-year-old man with a significantly elevated leukocyte count of 62,000/mm3, which suggests a leukocytosis. The normal hemoglobin and platelet counts indicate that there is no significant anemia or thrombocytopenia, which can be seen in some acute leukemias. The age of the patient and the leukocytosis are key factors in narrowing down the diagnosis.

Acute leukemias (both lymphoid and myeloid) typically present with symptoms of bone marrow failure such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia, which are not present here. Additionally, acute leukemias often present with a more rapid onset of symptoms, which this patient does not have.

Adult T cell leukemia is associated with HTLV-1 infection and is more common in certain geographic areas (e.g., Japan, Caribbean). It also typically presents with hypercalcemia and skin lesions, which are not mentioned here.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is common in older adults and often presents with asymptomatic leukocytosis, as seen in this patient. CLL is characterized by the proliferation of small, mature-appearing lymphocytes. The patient's age, asymptomatic presentation, and isolated leukocytosis are consistent with CLL.

Therefore, the best explanation for these findings is chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",9
582,"The patient presents with symptoms and history suggestive of chronic alcohol abuse, including multiple hospitalizations for alcohol-related injuries and seizures. The neurological examination reveals nystagmus and severe gait ataxia, and the MRI shows damage to the mammillary bodies. These findings are consistent with Wernicke's encephalopathy, which is due to thiamine deficiency. The appropriate treatment for Wernicke's encephalopathy is thiamine supplementation, which can help recover some cognitive functions. However, the persistence of significant short-term memory deficits, despite treatment, suggests progression to Korsakoff's syndrome. Korsakoff's syndrome is characterized by anterograde amnesia (difficulty forming new memories) while long-term memory remains intact, as seen in this patient who remembers past events well. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Korsakoff's syndrome.",9
584,"The scenario describes a viral infection that is causing a global pandemic, and the patient is treated with oseltamivir, which is used for influenza. Influenza viruses are known for their ability to cause pandemics due to their segmented RNA genome. This segmentation allows for reassortment, a process where segments from different viral strains can mix when a host is co-infected with two different strains. This reassortment can lead to significant genetic changes, potentially creating a new strain that can evade the immune system of individuals who have been previously infected or vaccinated. Therefore, the property that allows for such genetic change and the potential for pandemics is the segmented nature of the viral genome.",9
586,"The patient's symptoms of profuse watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and recent hospitalization for sepsis suggest a possible case of Clostridioides difficile infection, especially given his history of IV drug abuse and recent antibiotic use. The presence of blood on the toilet paper and weight loss further supports a severe gastrointestinal infection. In cases of suspected C. difficile infection, oral vancomycin is the recommended first-line treatment for severe cases. Metronidazole is no longer the first-line treatment for C. difficile, especially in severe cases. Clindamycin is not used for C. difficile and can actually cause it. Supportive therapy and ciprofloxacin are not appropriate for this presentation, as ciprofloxacin is not used for C. difficile and supportive therapy alone is insufficient for severe cases.",9
575,"This 15-year-old girl presents with short stature and delayed puberty, as evidenced by her Tanner stage 2 breast development and absence of menarche. Her bone age is delayed at 12 years, suggesting a constitutional delay of growth and puberty, a pattern often familial, as indicated by her father’s similar history.

In constitutional delay, the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is immature but otherwise normal. This means that the levels of GnRH, LH, FSH, and estrogen are typically low-normal or may start to rise slowly as puberty progresses naturally but delayed. However, since she has reached some degree of breast development (Tanner stage 2), her levels of FSH and LH would be expected to be increasing in the near future, but not necessarily fully elevated yet.

Overall, we expect to see normal levels of FSH, LH, estrogen, and GnRH at this point in her development, consistent with a delayed but normal progression of puberty.",9
585,"The patient's symptoms are indicative of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The chest pain is described as retrosternal, squeezing, and burning, which is positional and worsens when lying down. It is also exacerbated by food intake and emotional stress, and improves with antacids. These characteristics are typical of GERD, which is caused by the incompetence of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), allowing stomach acid to reflux into the esophagus. The positional nature of the pain and its improvement with antacids further support this diagnosis. Other options, such as a blood clot in the lungs (pulmonary embolism), would likely present with more acute symptoms like dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain. Decreased gastric mucosal protection could lead to peptic ulcer disease, but the positional nature and improvement with antacids are more characteristic of GERD. Insufficient blood supply to the myocardium (angina) would not typically improve with antacids and would be more likely to present with exertional symptoms.",9

591,"The patient is experiencing insomnia and is seeking a pharmacological solution that will not cause daytime drowsiness. Temazepam (A) is a benzodiazepine that can cause daytime sedation, making it less suitable for this patient. Diphenhydramine (B) is an antihistamine that also commonly causes daytime drowsiness. Suvorexant (C) is an orexin receptor antagonist that can cause next-day somnolence, especially in older adults. Zaleplon (D) is a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic with a short half-life, which minimizes the risk of next-day drowsiness. Therefore, Zaleplon is the most appropriate choice for this patient.",9

592,"The patient has been pinned between cars for several hours, which raises the concern for crush injury and potential rhabdomyolysis. In such cases, there is a risk of hyperkalemia due to the release of intracellular potassium from damaged muscle cells. Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker that can cause a further increase in serum potassium levels, potentially leading to dangerous hyperkalemia. Therefore, succinylcholine is contraindicated in patients with crush injuries or conditions that predispose them to hyperkalemia. The other agents listed do not have the same risk of causing hyperkalemia in this context.",9
598,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of an acute vascular issue in the abdomen. The sudden onset of abdominal pain, especially around the umbilicus, along with bloody loose bowel movements, points towards an ischemic process. His recent history of myocardial infarction, long-standing diabetes, hypertension, and smoking are significant risk factors for vascular disease. The presence of a bruit over the epigastric area suggests turbulent blood flow, likely due to stenosis or occlusion of a major abdominal artery. These findings are consistent with acute mesenteric ischemia, which is caused by a sudden reduction of blood flow to the intestines, often due to embolism or thrombosis in the mesenteric arteries. Colonic ischemia typically presents with left-sided abdominal pain and is less likely given the central pain and systemic risk factors. Peptic ulcer disease and irritable bowel syndrome do not match the acute presentation and systemic findings.",9
600,"The patient's presentation is consistent with cutaneous leishmaniasis, which is characterized by a solitary ulcerative lesion with regional lymphadenopathy. The history of travel to Guatemala, where Leishmania species are endemic, supports this diagnosis. Leishmania braziliensis is known to cause cutaneous leishmaniasis in Central and South America. The other options are less likely: Treponema pallidum causes syphilis, which typically presents with a painless chancre; Trypanosoma brucei causes African sleeping sickness, not endemic to Guatemala; and Ancylostoma duodenale is a hookworm causing gastrointestinal symptoms, not skin ulcers.",9
599,"The patient is in preterm labor at 26 weeks' gestation with significant cervical dilation and effacement, indicating active labor. The ultrasound findings suggest a severe fetal anomaly, likely holoprosencephaly, which is associated with poor prognosis. Given the advanced labor and the fetal condition, attempting to stop labor with tocolytics like nifedipine is not appropriate. Performing a cesarean delivery is not indicated due to the poor fetal prognosis and the risks associated with surgery. Dilation and evacuation is not appropriate at this gestational age. Allowing vaginal delivery is the most appropriate management, considering the fetal prognosis and the stage of labor.",9
603,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of acute cholecystitis, characterized by epigastric pain, fever, and a positive Murphy's sign (sudden inspiratory arrest during right upper quadrant palpation). The normal liver function tests and absence of jaundice make common bile duct obstruction less likely. The most common cause of acute cholecystitis is a gallstone obstructing the cystic duct, leading to inflammation of the gallbladder. This would not typically cause dilation of the common bile duct or intrahepatic biliary dilatation, which are more associated with choledocholithiasis. Fistula formation is a complication of chronic cholecystitis, not acute. Decreased echogenicity of the liver is unrelated to the symptoms described. Therefore, the most likely finding on abdominal imaging, such as an ultrasound, would be a gallstone in the cystic duct.",9
606,"To arrest chromosomes in metaphase, a drug that inhibits microtubule formation is used. Colchicine is a drug that disrupts microtubule polymerization, thereby arresting cells in metaphase. Colchicine is also used in the treatment of acute gouty arthritis because it reduces inflammation by inhibiting microtubule polymerization in neutrophils. Therefore, the drug used to arrest chromosomes in metaphase is the same as the one used to treat acute gouty arthritis.",9
595,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of hepatitis, including fatigue, fever, abdominal pain, jaundice, and elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT). The presence of HBsAg, anti-HBc IgG, and HBeAg indicates an active hepatitis B infection. The presence of HBeAg suggests active viral replication, which is characteristic of an acute or active chronic infection. However, the presence of anti-HBc IgG (rather than IgM) suggests that this is not an acute infection but rather a chronic one. The absence of anti-HCV rules out hepatitis C, and the history and lab findings do not support alcoholic hepatitis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is active chronic hepatitis B infection.",9
604,"The patient has a hemoglobin electrophoresis showing 55% HbA and 43% HbS, indicating sickle cell trait. In sickle cell trait, individuals typically have enough normal hemoglobin (HbA) to prevent sickling under normal conditions, but they can experience complications under extreme conditions such as severe dehydration or high altitude. One of the known complications of sickle cell trait is renal papillary necrosis due to microinfarctions in the renal medulla, which can lead to hematuria and other renal issues. The frequent nighttime urination could be related to a concentrating defect in the kidneys, which is also associated with sickle cell trait. Other options like clear cell renal carcinoma, functional asplenia, and ischemic stroke are more commonly associated with sickle cell disease rather than sickle cell trait.",9
617,"The clinical presentation suggests septic arthritis of the hip, given the acute onset of fever, refusal to walk, elevated inflammatory markers, and severe pain with hip movement. The widened acetabular space on X-ray indicates joint effusion. In a 2-year-old, the most common organisms causing septic arthritis are Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus species. Immediate management involves both diagnostic and therapeutic joint drainage to relieve pressure and obtain fluid for culture, followed by antibiotic therapy. Synovial fluid drainage is crucial to prevent joint damage. Cefazolin is appropriate for initial empiric coverage against common pathogens in this age group.",9
618,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder, including persistent low mood, weight loss, sleep disturbances, feelings of guilt, and decreased interest in activities. Additionally, he has symptoms of diabetic neuropathy, such as numbness in his extremities and erectile dysfunction. The best medication for treating both depression and diabetic neuropathy is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), such as duloxetine. SNRIs work by inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin, which can help alleviate depressive symptoms and also provide relief for neuropathic pain associated with diabetes.",9
619,"The patient is in hypovolemic shock, as indicated by the low blood pressure and high pulse rate, likely due to significant blood loss from the trauma. In the immediate aftermath of acute hemorrhage, the hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) levels may not yet reflect the blood loss because the body has not had time to equilibrate the fluid shifts. Initially, the Hb and Hct can appear normal or even elevated because the blood volume is reduced, but the concentration of red blood cells remains the same until fluid resuscitation occurs. Therefore, the CBC is most likely to show normal Hb and Hct levels immediately after the trauma, before any fluid replacement has been administered.",9
616,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a seizure, including myoclonic jerking movements, urinary incontinence, and postictal confusion. He also shows signs of neurological and systemic effects such as dry oral mucosa, muscle fasciculations, hand tremors, slow speech, and disorientation. These symptoms are consistent with lithium toxicity, which can occur when lithium is used for bipolar disorder and interacts with other medications or conditions that affect its clearance. The key here is identifying a medication that could have precipitated lithium toxicity. 

- **Valproic acid** is used in bipolar disorder but does not typically cause lithium toxicity.
- **Theophylline** is a bronchodilator that can cause neurological symptoms but is not typically associated with lithium toxicity.
- **Celecoxib** is a COX-2 inhibitor NSAID that can decrease renal clearance of lithium, leading to increased lithium levels and toxicity.
- **Metoprolol** is a beta-blocker that does not typically affect lithium levels.

Given the patient's history of bipolar disorder and the introduction of a new medication, celecoxib is the most likely to have interacted with lithium, causing toxicity and precipitating the seizure.",9
614,"The patient presents with a neck mass, weight loss, night sweats, and fever, which are suggestive of a lymphoma. The biopsy findings of large cells with a bilobed nucleus that are CD15- and CD30-positive are characteristic of Reed-Sternberg cells, indicating Hodgkin lymphoma. The laboratory findings show hypercalcemia with a calcium level of 14.5 mg/dL and a parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of 40 pg/mL. The PTH level is within the normal range, which suggests that the hypercalcemia is not due to primary hyperparathyroidism. In the context of malignancy, hypercalcemia can occur due to osteolytic metastasis or ectopic production of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), but PTHrP is not mentioned here. Hodgkin lymphoma can cause hypercalcemia through the production of calcitriol (active vitamin D) by macrophages, leading to increased intestinal absorption of calcium. This is consistent with ectopic vitamin D production causing hypercalcemia in this patient.",9
623,"The patient presents with hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis, which are suggestive of primary hyperaldosteronism. The elevated PAC:PRA ratio and lack of aldosterone suppression after salt loading confirm the diagnosis. The CT scan shows a 2 cm adrenal mass, likely an aldosterone-producing adenoma. Before proceeding with surgical intervention, it is important to confirm that the mass is the source of excess aldosterone production. Adrenal venous sampling is the best next step to differentiate between unilateral and bilateral aldosterone production, ensuring that the mass is responsible for the hyperaldosteronism and that surgery is appropriate.",9
621,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis), characterized by headache, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, and visual disturbances. The elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and thrombocytosis support this diagnosis. Polymyalgia rheumatica is a condition that commonly coexists with giant cell arteritis, presenting with proximal muscle pain and stiffness, particularly in the shoulders and hips. The other conditions listed do not have a strong association with giant cell arteritis.",9
638,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest trichinosis, a parasitic disease caused by Trichinella spiralis. This condition is associated with consuming undercooked or raw meat, particularly pork or wild game, which aligns with the patient's recent hunting trip to eastern Europe. The key symptoms include muscle pain, periorbital edema, fever, and eosinophilia. The elevated creatine kinase indicates muscle damage, which is consistent with trichinosis. Cooking meat to a safe temperature, such as 71°C (160°F), kills the Trichinella larvae and prevents infection. Therefore, cooking meat properly would have prevented this condition.",9
636,"After a meal, gastric acid secretion is stimulated to aid in digestion. The primary mediators of gastric acid secretion include acetylcholine, gastrin, and histamine. Acetylcholine is released from vagal nerve endings and stimulates parietal cells directly as well as indirectly by promoting gastrin and histamine release. At point A, which is likely shortly after the meal, the stomach is actively secreting acid to digest the food. Acetylcholine is a key mediator in this process, as it is involved in the cephalic and gastric phases of digestion, enhancing acid secretion. Prostaglandins and somatostatin are more involved in inhibiting acid secretion, while glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide is more related to insulin release in response to glucose. Therefore, acetylcholine is the most active mediator at this point.",9
631,"The infant presented with a high fever followed by a generalized rash. The key points in the history are the high fever (40.5°C) and the generalized tonic-clonic seizure, which are characteristic of febrile seizures. The fever resolved before the rash appeared, which is a classic presentation of Roseola infantum (also known as exanthem subitum or sixth disease). Roseola is caused by human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and typically affects children under 2 years of age. The rash in Roseola is maculopapular and blanches on pressure, as described. Posterior auricular lymphadenopathy is more commonly associated with rubella, but the sequence of high fever followed by rash is more indicative of Roseola. Kawasaki disease typically presents with prolonged fever, conjunctivitis, and other symptoms, while impetigo is a bacterial skin infection with crusted lesions. Rubella usually presents with a rash and lymphadenopathy but not with the high fever and seizure seen here.",9
628,"The patient is an HIV-positive individual with a CD4+ count of 250/mm3, indicating immunosuppression. She presents with symptoms of headache, confusion, and papilledema, along with CSF findings of elevated opening pressure, low glucose, elevated protein, and a mild lymphocytic pleocytosis. These findings are suggestive of a central nervous system infection. 

Given the patient's immunocompromised status and the CSF profile, cryptococcal meningitis is a strong consideration. Cryptococcus neoformans is a common cause of meningitis in HIV patients with CD4 counts below 350/mm3. The India ink stain of the CSF is a classic test for identifying Cryptococcus, as it reveals encapsulated yeast cells.

Other options are less likely: 
- A positive acid-fast bacillus stain would suggest tuberculosis, which is less common with these specific CSF findings.
- Gram-negative diplococci would suggest Neisseria meningitidis, which typically presents with a more acute onset and a different CSF profile.
- Multiple ring-enhancing lesions on CT are more indicative of cerebral toxoplasmosis or other space-occupying lesions, not consistent with the CSF findings here.

Therefore, the most likely additional finding is encapsulated yeast cells on an India ink stain of the CSF.",9
644,"The patient presents with multiple, nontender, round, white macules on the chest and trunk, with fine scaling when scraped. This presentation is consistent with tinea versicolor, a common fungal infection caused by Malassezia species, particularly Malassezia globosa. The key features are the hypopigmented macules and fine scaling, which are characteristic of this condition. The recent trip to the Caribbean, a warm and humid environment, could have facilitated the growth of this yeast. The other options do not fit the clinical picture: autoimmune destruction of melanocytes would suggest vitiligo, increased sebum production is related to acne, and human herpes virus 7 is associated with roseola, which presents differently.",9
646,"The patient has already tried first-line treatments for nicotine dependence, including nicotine replacement therapy and varenicline, as well as antidepressants and talk therapy. The psychiatrist is considering a second-line medication for non-nicotine pharmacotherapy. Among the options provided, clonidine is known to be used as a second-line treatment for nicotine dependence. Buprenorphine is used for opioid dependence, lorazepam is a benzodiazepine used for anxiety, and topiramate is an anticonvulsant that is not typically used for nicotine dependence. Therefore, clonidine is the most appropriate choice for this scenario.",9
647,"The physician is identifying patients with a specific condition (cirrhosis) and comparing them to patients without the condition to assess prior exposures. This is characteristic of a case-control study, where cases (patients with the condition) are compared to controls (patients without the condition) to identify factors that may have contributed to the condition. The study looks retrospectively at exposures, which aligns with the case-control design.",9
651,"The scenario describes a situation where individuals with a history of trauma are more likely to undergo X-ray imaging, which increases the likelihood of diagnosing spondyloarthritis. This is an example of detection bias, where the likelihood of detecting the disease is influenced by the exposure (history of trauma) rather than the disease itself. Detection bias can lead to an overestimation of the association between the exposure and the outcome.

To minimize detection bias, the outcome should be assessed in a way that is independent of the exposure status. Options B, C, and D describe methods that help reduce bias by ensuring that the outcome assessment is not influenced by knowledge of the exposure status.

- Option A: If the outcome is ascertained through electronic health records, there is a risk that individuals with a history of trauma might have more detailed records or more frequent imaging, leading to detection bias.
- Option B: Systematic assessment regardless of exposure helps reduce bias.
- Option C: Masking the exposure status during outcome assessment helps prevent bias.
- Option D: Subjecting all participants to identical tests reduces bias.

Therefore, the bias is more likely to occur if the outcome is ascertained through electronic health records, as this method does not inherently control for differential detection based on exposure.",9
652,"The patient presents with acute urinary retention, which is characterized by the sudden inability to urinate, suprapubic tenderness, and a large volume of urine in the bladder. He has a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which can cause urinary retention, but the sudden onset of symptoms suggests an acute exacerbation rather than gradual worsening of BPH. The key detail is that the patient recently started taking phenylephrine, a medication known to cause urinary retention by stimulating alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, leading to contraction of the smooth muscle in the bladder neck and prostate. This is a common side effect in patients with BPH. Therefore, the most likely etiology of the patient's symptoms is medication-induced urinary retention due to phenylephrine.",9
656,"The patient has hyponatremia with a plasma sodium concentration of 126 mg/dL. The urinalysis shows a high urine osmolality of 1085 mOsm/L, indicating that the kidneys are concentrating urine despite the low plasma sodium. This suggests the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), where there is excessive release of ADH (vasopressin) leading to water retention and dilutional hyponatremia. SIADH can be caused by certain medications, including some antidepressants. The cell bodies responsible for the production of ADH are located in the hypothalamus, specifically in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei. These neurons then transport ADH to the posterior pituitary for release into the bloodstream.",9
655,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of Cushing's syndrome, including elevated cortisol levels and elevated ACTH levels. The elevated ACTH indicates ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome, which could be due to a pituitary adenoma (Cushing's disease) or ectopic ACTH production. The next step is to differentiate between these two possibilities. A high-dose dexamethasone suppression test is used to distinguish between pituitary and ectopic sources of ACTH. In Cushing's disease, cortisol production is suppressed by high-dose dexamethasone, whereas ectopic ACTH production is not suppressed.",9
649,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of vitamin B12 deficiency, including fatigue, numbness, glossitis, and neurological deficits such as absent vibration and position sense, broad-based gait, and positive Romberg sign. The history of partial gastrectomy suggests impaired absorption of vitamin B12 due to loss of intrinsic factor-producing gastric parietal cells. The laboratory findings of anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia are consistent with pancytopenia seen in vitamin B12 deficiency. Elevated methylmalonic acid levels are indicative of vitamin B12 deficiency, as B12 is required for the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. Therefore, the most likely laboratory finding in this patient is elevated methylmalonic acid levels.",9
657,"The patient has an irregularly enlarged uterus and a 4 cm hypoechoic mass inside the myometrial wall. This presentation is most consistent with a leiomyoma, also known as a fibroid, which is a benign smooth muscle tumor of the uterus. Leiomyomas are common in women of reproductive age and can cause an irregularly enlarged uterus. The hypoechoic nature of the mass on ultrasound is typical for leiomyomas. Endometrial cancer and hyperplasia typically involve the endometrial lining rather than the myometrium. Uterine leiomyosarcoma is a rare malignant tumor that would be less likely given the patient's presentation and the commonality of leiomyomas.",9
660,"The patient has a pulsatile mass with a thrill and bruit over the left anterior thigh, indicating the presence of an arteriovenous (AV) fistula due to the stab wound. An AV fistula can lead to high-output cardiac failure because the abnormal connection between the artery and vein allows blood to bypass the capillary system, increasing venous return to the heart. This increased preload can eventually overwhelm the heart's ability to compensate, leading to high-output cardiac failure. The other options are less likely: pudendal nerve compression is not related to this presentation, an iliac artery aneurysm is not indicated by the symptoms, and femoral head necrosis is not a direct risk from an AV fistula.",9
664,"The patient presents with symptoms and history suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB): chronic cough with sputum production, fever, weight loss, and a history of emigration from a region where TB is more prevalent. The laboratory findings show an elevated leukocyte count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which are consistent with an inflammatory process. Given the clinical suspicion of TB, the most appropriate next step is to confirm the diagnosis. Collecting sputum specimens for acid-fast bacilli smear microscopy, culture, and nucleic acid amplification is the standard approach to diagnose active pulmonary TB. This method allows for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is crucial for initiating appropriate treatment. Other options, such as a CT scan or biopsy, are not first-line diagnostic steps for suspected TB.",9
661,"The patient's symptoms and history provide important clues. He experiences joint pain that worsens with activity and improves with rest, which is characteristic of osteoarthritis. The pain is primarily in weight-bearing joints such as the hips and knees, and also in the left great toe. The presence of crepitus in the hip further supports degenerative joint disease. His risk factors include obesity and age, which are common for osteoarthritis. Although he has a history of heavy alcohol use and hypertension, which are risk factors for gout, the presentation of pain with activity and improvement with rest is more indicative of osteoarthritis rather than the acute, severe pain of gout. Infectious arthritis is less likely given the chronic nature of the symptoms and lack of systemic signs of infection. Pseudogout typically affects the knees and presents with acute attacks, which does not match this patient's chronic symptomatology. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is osteoarthritis.",9
676,"The patient is experiencing urinary retention, a common postoperative complication, especially after surgeries involving anesthesia. The bladder scan shows 450cc of urine, indicating significant retention. The most immediate and effective way to relieve her symptoms and prevent further complications, such as bladder overdistension or infection, is to perform catheterization to drain the bladder. Other options like oral bethanechol or intravenous neostigmine are not immediate solutions and are typically considered if retention persists after initial management. Intravenous furosemide is not appropriate as it would increase urine production, potentially worsening the retention.",9
673,"The patient presents with symptoms of bowel obstruction, including severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and abdominal distention. The examination reveals diffuse tenderness and hypoactive bowel sounds, which are consistent with an obstruction. The history of an ectopic pregnancy suggests the possibility of prior abdominal surgery or inflammation, which can lead to the formation of adhesions. Adhesions are the most common cause of small bowel obstruction, especially in patients with a history of abdominal surgery. The other options are less likely: hernias would typically present with a palpable mass, enlarged Peyer’s patches are associated with intussusception in children, and gastrointestinal malignancy is less common in this age group and would likely present with additional systemic symptoms.",9
675,"The newborn presents with conjunctivitis characterized by mucopurulent discharge and mild eyelid swelling at 2 weeks of age. The PCR assay confirms the diagnosis, which is likely Chlamydia trachomatis conjunctivitis, a common cause of neonatal conjunctivitis occurring between 5 and 14 days after birth. The appropriate treatment for Chlamydial conjunctivitis in neonates is oral erythromycin, as it effectively treats the infection and prevents complications such as pneumonia.",9
666,"The patient is at 37 weeks' gestation and in active labor. She has not been tested for GBS colonization during this pregnancy, and her previous child had a GBS infection leading to sepsis. According to guidelines, if a woman has a history of a previous infant with invasive GBS disease, she should receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis regardless of her current GBS colonization status. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to administer intrapartum intravenous penicillin to prevent GBS transmission to the newborn.",9
677,"The patient's headache is described as moderate, throbbing, and located in the occipital region bilaterally, with tenderness over the cervical muscles. She denies visual or auditory disturbances, nausea, or vomiting, which makes migraine less likely. The headache is associated with mild photophobia, but this can occur in tension-type headaches as well. The occipital location and muscle tenderness suggest a tension-type headache, possibly related to stress from her job as a corporate attorney. There are no red flags such as neurological deficits or sudden onset that would necessitate immediate imaging. Therefore, the next best step is to address potential triggers and provide non-pharmacological management, such as lifestyle changes, relaxation techniques, and massage therapy, which are appropriate for tension-type headaches.",9
679,"The patient is a 15-year-old girl with a 2-year history of irregular menstrual cycles occurring every 45 to 60 days since menarche. Her last period was 5 weeks ago, lasted 7 days, and was heavy but without cramping. She is not sexually active, and her pregnancy test is negative. Her physical examination is normal, and her BMI is within the normal range.

In adolescents, irregular menstrual cycles are often due to anovulation, which is common in the first few years after menarche as the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis matures. Anovulation leads to irregular shedding of the endometrium, resulting in irregular and sometimes heavy menstrual bleeding.

Pituitary adenoma is less likely given the lack of other symptoms such as galactorrhea or visual changes. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) typically presents with additional symptoms such as hirsutism, acne, and obesity, which are not present in this patient. Ovarian insufficiency would be unusual in someone so young and would typically present with symptoms of estrogen deficiency, such as hot flashes or vaginal dryness, which are not described here.

Therefore, the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms is anovulation due to the immaturity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis.",9
681,"The patient presents with a history of easy bruising and persistent bleeding after dental surgery, along with a family history of similar bleeding issues. The laboratory findings show a normal platelet count and normal bleeding time, but a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT). This pattern suggests a defect in the intrinsic coagulation pathway, which is consistent with hemophilia. Hemophilia is an X-linked recessive disorder, which explains the family history of bleeding problems in male relatives. The normal platelet count and bleeding time rule out platelet function disorders like Glanzmann thrombasthenia and Bernard-Soulier syndrome. Immune thrombocytopenia would present with a low platelet count, which is not the case here. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is hemophilia.",9
678,"The patient was started on paroxetine for a major depressive episode and is now feeling much better after 6 weeks of treatment. He has a history of recurrent depressive episodes, as indicated by the two episodes last year. In cases of recurrent major depressive disorder, it is recommended to continue antidepressant therapy for at least 1-3 years to prevent relapse. Discontinuing the medication too early could lead to a relapse of symptoms. Switching to lithium is not indicated as there is no evidence of bipolar disorder. Continuing therapy for only 6 months is typically recommended for a single episode of depression, not recurrent episodes. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to continue paroxetine therapy for 2 years to prevent relapse.",9
682,"The patient's symptoms and lab findings suggest hemochromatosis, a condition characterized by iron overload. This condition can lead to organ damage due to iron deposition. 

- Option A: Hemochromatosis can lead to cardiac issues such as cardiomyopathy due to iron deposition in the heart, so this statement is true.
- Option B: Hemochromatosis is treated with phlebotomy or iron chelators like deferoxamine, not calcium chelators. Therefore, this statement is false.
- Option C: There is an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma due to liver damage from iron overload, so this statement is true.
- Option D: Skin bronzing is a classic symptom of hemochromatosis due to iron deposition in the skin, so this statement is true.

Thus, the statement that is not true regarding this patient's condition is option B.",9
683,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a subdural hematoma. The key points include his recent falls, behavioral changes, headaches, and focal neurological deficits such as decreased grip strength. These symptoms are consistent with a subdural hematoma, which often occurs due to tearing of bridging veins, especially in older adults who have experienced head trauma. The gradual onset of symptoms over weeks aligns with a chronic subdural hematoma, which is common in this age group and with this mechanism of injury.",9
689,"The scenario describes a classic presentation of Tetralogy of Fallot, a congenital heart defect. The key features include a boot-shaped heart on X-ray and cyanotic spells that improve with knee-chest positioning. The condition is caused by an anterosuperior displacement of the infundibular septum. The four characteristic features of Tetralogy of Fallot are: pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, ventricular septal defect, and an overriding aorta.",10
701,"The patient's symptoms and findings suggest primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome), likely due to an adrenal adenoma. The key features of primary hyperaldosteronism include hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. Aldosterone causes sodium retention (leading to hypernatremia), potassium excretion (leading to hypokalemia), and hydrogen ion excretion (leading to metabolic alkalosis). The presence of an adrenal mass supports the diagnosis of an aldosterone-producing adenoma. Therefore, the laboratory findings would most likely show metabolic alkalosis, hypernatremia, and hypokalemia.",9
698,"The question describes a synaptic transmission involving small vesicles with dense cores, which is characteristic of catecholamine neurotransmitters. These dense-core vesicles are typically associated with the storage and release of neurotransmitters like norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine. Among the options provided, epinephrine is a catecholamine and is stored in dense-core vesicles. GABA and glutamate are amino acid neurotransmitters and are not typically stored in dense-core vesicles. Follicle stimulating hormone is a peptide hormone, not a neurotransmitter. Therefore, the neurotransmitter most likely released from small vesicles with dense cores in this context is epinephrine.",9
705,"The patient has developed inflammation and fibrosis in the terminal bronchioles 3 years after a lung transplant, which is indicative of chronic rejection. Chronic rejection in lung transplants is characterized by bronchiolitis obliterans, which involves lymphocytic inflammation and fibrosis of the bronchioles. This is due to a chronic immune response against the transplanted tissue, leading to progressive narrowing and obliteration of the small airways. The correct pathophysiological mechanism is lymphocytic inflammation of the bronchiolar wall, which corresponds to option B.",9
714,"The patient's symptoms and presentation are suggestive of Wilson's disease, a disorder characterized by copper accumulation in the body, particularly affecting the liver and brain. The key symptoms include neurological changes such as tremors, dystonia, incoordination, psychiatric symptoms like depression and behavioral changes, and hepatic dysfunction. The mention of the patient's eye likely refers to Kayser-Fleischer rings, which are deposits of copper in the cornea. Wilson's disease is due to a genetic defect leading to impaired copper excretion, resulting in copper accumulation, particularly in the basal ganglia, which explains the neurological symptoms. Therefore, the etiology of this illness is mineral accumulation in the basal ganglia.",9
704,"The patient's symptoms and the description of the organism suggest an infection with Vibrio cholerae. The key features include severe watery diarrhea, dehydration (evidenced by decreased skin turgor and hypotension), and the identification of a gram-negative, comma-shaped organism. Vibrio cholerae produces cholera toxin, which is known to increase adenylyl cyclase activity. This toxin ADP-ribosylates the Gs protein, leading to persistent activation of adenylyl cyclase, resulting in increased levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP). The elevated cAMP levels cause increased secretion of chloride ions into the intestinal lumen, followed by water, leading to the characteristic watery diarrhea. Therefore, the action of the toxin most likely involved in this patient's symptoms is increased adenylyl cyclase activity.",9
710,"The patient is presenting with signs of hypovolemic shock, likely due to intra-abdominal bleeding from the trauma, as indicated by hypotension, tachycardia, and abdominal tenderness with bruising. In hypovolemic shock, there is a loss of blood volume leading to decreased preload and cardiac output. This results in compensatory mechanisms such as increased systemic vascular resistance to maintain blood pressure. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) is a reflection of left atrial pressure and is typically decreased in hypovolemic shock due to reduced blood volume. Mixed venous oxygen saturation is usually decreased due to increased oxygen extraction by tissues. Right atrial pressure is also decreased due to reduced venous return. Therefore, the parameter most likely to be seen in this patient is decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.",9
719,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of central cord syndrome, which is characterized by weakness and sensory deficits more pronounced in the upper extremities than the lower extremities. This condition often occurs in older individuals with cervical spondylosis who experience hyperextension injuries. The best imaging modality to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of spinal cord injury is an MRI of the cervical spine. MRI provides detailed images of the spinal cord, intervertebral discs, and surrounding soft tissues, which are crucial for diagnosing central cord syndrome.",9
721,"The patient is a chronic alcoholic with hypoglycemia and a high blood alcohol level. Chronic alcohol use can lead to nutritional deficiencies, particularly of folate and vitamin B12, which can cause macrocytic anemia. This is characterized by an increased mean corpuscular volume (MCV) greater than 100 fL. The administration of thiamine is also indicative of concern for Wernicke's encephalopathy, which is associated with thiamine deficiency in alcoholics. While hypersegmented neutrophils can be seen in megaloblastic anemia due to folate or B12 deficiency, the most direct laboratory finding related to chronic alcohol use is macrocytosis. Sickle cells and Howell-Jolly bodies are not related to alcohol use. Therefore, the most likely laboratory finding in this patient is macrocytosis.",9
722,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs consistent with peripheral artery disease (PAD), including claudication, shiny skin, reduced hair, and diminished pulses. The ABI values of 0.5 and 0.6 confirm significant PAD. The most appropriate initial management for claudication due to PAD is lifestyle modification, particularly smoking cessation and a structured exercise program. Graded exercise therapy is recommended as it improves symptoms and walking distance in patients with claudication. Other options like propranolol, spinal cord stimulation, and vascular bypass surgery are not first-line treatments for claudication.",9
684,"The patient is in the second stage of labor, which is the time from full cervical dilation to the delivery of the baby. The second stage can be prolonged if there is inadequate fetal descent. In this case, the cervix is fully dilated, but the fetal vertex remains at -1 station for two hours despite adequate contractions. This suggests a possible arrest of descent. The fetal heart rate is reassuring, and the mother is coping well without epidural anesthesia. Since the contractions are adequate and the fetal heart rate is stable, observation for another hour is reasonable to allow more time for descent before considering operative interventions. Cesarean section and vacuum-assisted delivery are more invasive and are generally considered if there is no progress after a reasonable period of observation or if there are signs of fetal distress, which are not present here.",9
723,"The patient's history and symptoms suggest a sexually transmitted infection. The initial painless ulceration on the penis that resolved spontaneously is characteristic of a primary syphilis chancre caused by Treponema pallidum. However, the current symptoms of tender nodules with purulent discharge in the groin are more indicative of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), which is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (serovars L1, L2, or L3). LGV typically presents with a painless ulcer followed by painful inguinal lymphadenopathy and possible suppuration. The patient's sexual history and lack of condom use increase the likelihood of a sexually transmitted infection like LGV. Bartonella henselae is associated with cat scratch disease, which doesn't fit the presentation, and Haemophilus ducreyi causes painful chancroid ulcers, not painless ones. Therefore, the most likely causal pathogen is Chlamydia trachomatis.",9
724,"The patient presents with numbness, burning sensation, and decreased muscle strength in the lower extremities, along with decreased sensation to pain, vibration, and position. These symptoms are consistent with peripheral neuropathy. The patient is undergoing chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma and is receiving a regimen that includes vincristine. Vincristine is known to cause peripheral neuropathy as a common adverse effect due to its neurotoxic properties. The timing of the symptoms, occurring after several cycles of chemotherapy, aligns with the cumulative neurotoxic effects of vincristine. Other options such as spinal cord compression, paraneoplastic autoantibodies, and Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease are less likely given the context and specific presentation. Spinal cord compression would likely present with more acute and severe motor deficits and possibly bowel or bladder dysfunction. Paraneoplastic syndromes are less common and would not typically present with the specific pattern seen here. Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease is a hereditary condition and would not present acutely in this manner in a 67-year-old man.",9
733,"Methylphenidate is a stimulant medication commonly used to treat ADHD. One of the known side effects of stimulant medications is an increase in heart rate and blood pressure. Therefore, it is important to assess any cardiovascular history before starting the medication. A past history of Kawasaki disease is relevant because it can lead to coronary artery aneurysms and other cardiovascular complications. Thus, obtaining a cardiovascular history is crucial to ensure the safe use of methylphenidate in this patient.",9
735,"The patient's symptoms and esophagogram findings suggest diffuse esophageal spasm (DES). This condition is characterized by uncoordinated contractions of the esophagus, which can cause chest pain that mimics angina. The relief of pain with nitrates, which relax smooth muscle, supports this diagnosis. In DES, esophageal manometry typically shows simultaneous contractions that are uncoordinated and can have multiple peaks. This corresponds to option A. Option B would suggest esophagitis, option C would indicate myocardial injury, and option D describes nutcracker esophagus, which is characterized by high-amplitude peristaltic contractions rather than uncoordinated ones.",9
730,"The patient presents with jaundice, pruritus, pale stools, and dark urine, indicating obstructive jaundice. The lab results show elevated direct bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, which are consistent with cholestasis. The ultrasound reveals a cystic mass in the subhepatic region and bile duct dilation. The palpable mass in the right upper quadrant is likely Courvoisier's sign, which suggests a non-gallstone cause of bile duct obstruction, such as a pancreatic or biliary tumor. The history of smoking and weight loss further supports a malignancy. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, particularly at the head of the pancreas, can cause bile duct obstruction and Courvoisier's sign. Choledocholithiasis would not typically present with a cystic mass, and alcoholic hepatitis and cholecystitis do not match the clinical picture of bile duct obstruction with a cystic mass.",9
737,"The patient presents with primary amenorrhea, breast development, and a blind vaginal pouch, which suggests androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). In AIS, individuals have a 46,XY karyotype but are phenotypically female due to androgen receptor dysfunction. The presence of Tanner IV breasts indicates estrogen production, likely from aromatization of testosterone. The absence of pubic and axillary hair is consistent with androgen insensitivity. The best next step in management for AIS, after confirming the diagnosis with genetic testing, is gonadectomy. This is because individuals with AIS have undescended testes, which have a risk of malignant transformation if left in situ. Therefore, the best next step is to perform a gonadectomy to prevent this risk.",9
738,"The patient is a 60-year-old man with symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), such as urinary frequency and a symmetrically enlarged prostate on digital rectal examination. There are no signs of infection (e.g., fever, burning pain on urination) or malignancy (e.g., nodules on prostate exam, hematuria). The most appropriate next step in management is to perform a urinalysis. This test will help rule out urinary tract infection or hematuria, which could contribute to his symptoms. Other options like urine cytology, serum PSA, and uroflowmetry are not immediately necessary without further indication of malignancy or obstruction.",9
744,"The patient's symptoms of tremors, weight loss, increased sweating, and the presence of a diffuse goiter suggest hyperthyroidism. In hyperthyroidism, the thyroid gland is overactive, producing excessive amounts of thyroid hormones (T4 and T3), which leads to a decrease in TSH due to negative feedback on the pituitary gland. The patient's past medical history of vitiligo, an autoimmune condition, raises the possibility of Graves' disease, which is a common cause of hyperthyroidism and is also autoimmune in nature. Therefore, the expected hormonal imbalance in this case would be low TSH due to negative feedback from high levels of thyroid hormones, and high free T4 and free T3 levels due to the overactive thyroid gland.",9
743,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of acute cholangitis, characterized by fever, jaundice, and right upper quadrant pain (Charcot's triad). The ultrasound findings of dilated bile ducts and gallstones support this diagnosis. The patient's condition has worsened, indicating possible sepsis due to biliary obstruction and infection. The most appropriate next step in management is to relieve the obstruction and drain the infected bile duct. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the procedure of choice for both diagnosis and therapeutic intervention in acute cholangitis, as it allows for stone removal and bile duct decompression.",9
741,"The patient has undergone a splenectomy, which increases his risk for infections with encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Neisseria meningitidis. To reduce this risk, certain vaccinations are recommended post-splenectomy. The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) is one of the vaccines recommended for asplenic patients to protect against pneumococcal infections. Although the patient was up-to-date on vaccinations prior to the accident, the specific need for pneumococcal vaccination post-splenectomy is critical. The other options, such as the influenza vaccine, MMR vaccine, and tetanus booster, are not specifically indicated due to the splenectomy at this time.",9
747,"The patient is a 13-year-old boy with a subareolar mass in the right breast. He is in Tanner stage 3, indicating he is in the midst of puberty. During puberty, it is common for boys to develop gynecomastia due to hormonal changes, specifically an imbalance between estrogen and testosterone. This condition is usually benign and self-limiting. The mass is described as mildly tender and firm, which is consistent with pubertal gynecomastia. The other options are less likely: a Leydig cell tumor would present with other symptoms and is rare; cetirizine is not known to cause gynecomastia; invasive ductal carcinoma is extremely rare in males, especially at this age. Therefore, the most likely explanation is normal development due to pubertal changes.",9
755,"The patient's symptoms and clinical findings suggest a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis. She has stiffness and pain in multiple joints, particularly in the fingers, which is characteristic of psoriatic arthritis. The presence of well-demarcated red plaques with silvery-white scales on the skin is indicative of psoriasis. Additionally, the nail changes described, such as nails that break easily and look spotty, are consistent with nail psoriasis, which is often associated with psoriatic arthritis. The negative rheumatoid factor and ANA help rule out rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, respectively. Secondary syphilis can cause a rash and joint pain, but the specific skin and nail findings, along with the joint involvement, are more characteristic of psoriatic arthritis. Ankylosing spondylitis typically presents with back pain and stiffness, but it does not usually involve the skin and nails in this manner.",9
762,"The patient presents with severe hyponatremia (sodium level of 111 mEq/L) and confusion, likely due to his chronic alcoholism and recent increase in alcohol consumption. In cases of severe hyponatremia, especially when symptomatic, urgent treatment is often required. The rapid correction of hyponatremia, particularly if done too quickly, can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS), also known as central pontine myelinolysis. This condition occurs because rapid shifts in sodium levels can cause damage to the myelin sheath of neurons, particularly in the pons. Therefore, the urgent treatment of this patient's severe hyponatremia increases the risk of osmotic myelinolysis.",9
728,"The patient presents with hyperkalemia (potassium 5.7 mEq/L) and a metabolic acidosis (bicarbonate 18 mEq/L). His elevated creatinine (2.1 mg/dL) and BUN (29 mg/dL) suggest decreased renal function. The presence of hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis with preserved renal function indicates a potential renal tubular acidosis (RTA). Chronic renal failure would also cause hyperkalemia and acidosis, but the creatinine level is not extremely high, suggesting some preserved renal function. Furosemide typically causes hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, not the observed hyperkalemia and acidosis. Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, does not typically cause these specific electrolyte or acid-base disturbances. Given the combination of hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and relatively mild renal impairment, renal tubular acidosis is the most likely cause.",9
766,"In the context of preventing vertical transmission of HIV, the key factor is the maternal viral load. For women with an HIV viral load greater than 1,000 copies/mL near the time of delivery, a cesarean section is recommended to reduce the risk of transmission. This patient's viral load is 1,400 copies/mL, which is above the threshold where cesarean delivery is advised to minimize the risk of transmission to the newborn. Increasing the AZT dose or adding nevirapine would not be the immediate step in labor, and treating the newborn with AZT is done after delivery, not as a preventive measure during labor.",9
767,"The patient's presentation is consistent with pseudogout, also known as calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition disease. This is suggested by the presence of rhomboid-shaped, weakly positively birefringent crystals in the synovial fluid. Pseudogout is associated with several metabolic conditions, one of which is hyperparathyroidism. Hyperparathyroidism can lead to increased calcium levels, which predispose to the formation of CPPD crystals. The other options, such as dyslipidemia, local skin abrasion, and recent gastrointestinal infection, are not known to be strong predisposing factors for pseudogout.",9
764,"The clinical presentation of fever, sore throat, and a whitish membrane on the tonsil, along with tender cervical lymphadenopathy, suggests a bacterial pharyngitis, likely caused by Group A Streptococcus (GAS). The patient has a history of an allergic reaction to amoxicillin, which is a penicillin derivative, indicated by the rash and facial swelling. Therefore, penicillin V (option A) is not appropriate due to the risk of cross-reactivity in penicillin-allergic patients. Total tonsillectomy (option B) is not indicated for an acute infection and is generally reserved for recurrent or chronic tonsillitis. Fluconazole (option C) is an antifungal and not appropriate for bacterial infections. Erythromycin (option D) is a macrolide antibiotic that can be used as an alternative in patients with penicillin allergy for treating streptococcal pharyngitis. Therefore, the next most appropriate step in management is to prescribe erythromycin.",9
769,"The patient presents with signs of sepsis, likely due to pneumonia, given the fever, cough, shortness of breath, and lung findings. The hypotension and tachycardia suggest septic shock. After inserting a central venous catheter, it is crucial to confirm its placement to avoid complications such as pneumothorax, especially since the procedure was performed in an emergency setting. A chest X-ray is the most appropriate next step to confirm the position of the central line and check for any immediate complications like pneumothorax.",9
773,"The patient's symptoms include impaired flexion of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints while flexion of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints remains intact. The flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) is responsible for flexing the PIP joints, while the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) flexes the DIP joints. Since the PIP joint flexion is impaired but the DIP joint flexion is intact, this suggests an injury to the FDS muscle. The other muscles listed (flexor carpi radialis and flexor carpi ulnaris) are involved in wrist flexion and do not directly affect finger joint flexion.",9
781,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI), including dysuria, fever, and chills. The right lower quadrant and flank pain, along with fever and tachycardia, suggest the possibility of pyelonephritis, which is a kidney infection often resulting from an ascending UTI. The history of ovarian cysts is likely incidental and not related to the current symptoms. The presence of nausea and the location of the pain further support the diagnosis of pyelonephritis. Therefore, the most likely pathophysiology is an ascending infection of the urinary tract leading to kidney involvement.",9
771,"In clinical trials, the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis is the most appropriate method to use when there is a significant number of patients lost to follow-up or who do not adhere to the assigned treatment. ITT includes all randomized participants in the groups to which they were originally assigned, regardless of whether they completed the treatment, adhered to the protocol, or were lost to follow-up. This approach preserves the benefits of randomization and provides an unbiased estimate of the treatment effect. 

Per-protocol analysis, on the other hand, only includes participants who completed the study according to the protocol, which can introduce bias and overestimate the treatment effect, especially if there is a significant dropout rate.

Sub-group analysis focuses on specific subsets of participants, which can lead to misleading conclusions if not pre-specified and properly powered.

Non-inferiority analysis is used to demonstrate that a new treatment is not worse than an existing treatment by a specified margin, which is not the goal in this scenario.

Therefore, the most appropriate technique to attempt to prove the superiority of Aclotsaban, while accounting for the issues with follow-up and adherence, is the intention-to-treat analysis.",9
784,"The patient is taking phenelzine, which is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). MAOIs can cause hypertensive crises when foods or drinks containing tyramine, such as wine, are consumed. The symptoms of a hypertensive crisis include severe headache, nausea, vomiting, sweating, and dilated pupils, all of which are present in this patient. Therefore, the most likely elevated parameter in this patient is blood pressure due to the hypertensive crisis triggered by the interaction between phenelzine and tyramine-containing wine.",9
786,"The patient presents with symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, hypernatremia, and low urine osmolality, which are suggestive of diabetes insipidus. The elevated antidiuretic hormone (ADH) level indicates that the kidneys are not responding to ADH, pointing towards nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Given her history of bipolar disorder, it is likely she is on lithium, a common mood stabilizer known to cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus by reducing the kidney's response to ADH. This explains her symptoms of excessive thirst, urination, and the laboratory findings.",9
787,"The patient's symptoms and coronary angiography findings are consistent with coronary artery disease due to atherosclerosis. In atherosclerosis, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of the disease. PDGF is known to stimulate the migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells from the media to the intima of the blood vessel wall. This migration and proliferation contribute to the formation of the fibrous cap of the atherosclerotic plaque. Therefore, the most likely effect of increased levels of PDGF in the atherosclerotic lesion is the intimal migration of smooth muscle cells.",9
778,"The patient's symptoms include fatigue, palpitations, and pallor, which suggest anemia. The joint pain that was worse in the morning and self-resolved, along with the runny nose and congestion, could indicate a recent viral infection. The presence of splenomegaly and the acute onset of symptoms are key clues. These symptoms are consistent with parvovirus B19 infection, which can cause transient aplastic crisis, especially in individuals with underlying conditions like hereditary spherocytosis. The mutation of ankyrin is associated with hereditary spherocytosis, which can lead to splenomegaly and anemia. The acute presentation of anemia in this context is most likely due to a transient aplastic crisis triggered by parvovirus B19 infection in a patient with hereditary spherocytosis. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms is a mutation of ankyrin causing hereditary spherocytosis, exacerbated by a recent parvovirus B19 infection.",9
790,"The patient is at 33 weeks' gestation with a history of oligohydramnios in a previous pregnancy and currently presents with a small uterine size for dates, an estimated fetal weight below the 10th percentile, and decreased amniotic fluid volume. These findings suggest intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and oligohydramnios. In such cases, close fetal monitoring is essential to assess fetal well-being and decide on the timing of delivery. Serial nonstress tests (NSTs) are a non-invasive way to monitor fetal heart rate patterns and assess fetal well-being. This approach allows for regular assessment of the fetus's condition, which is crucial given the risk factors present. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to initiate serial nonstress tests.",9
792,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with peripheral neuropathy, characterized by numbness, tingling, weakness, and absent deep tendon reflexes. The presence of bilateral ptosis, facial weakness, and foot drop further supports this diagnosis. Among the chemotherapeutic agents listed, vincristine is well-known for causing peripheral neuropathy as a common adverse effect. Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone do not typically cause this type of neuropathy. Therefore, the symptoms are most likely due to vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy.",9
804,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of infective endocarditis, particularly given his history of IV drug use and the presence of a murmur. Blood cultures have identified MRSA, a common cause of endocarditis in IV drug users. Despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, the patient's symptoms are not improving, which raises concern for complications such as abscess formation or inadequate source control. A transthoracic echocardiogram may have been done initially, but a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is more sensitive for detecting vegetations, abscesses, or other complications of endocarditis. Therefore, the best next step is to perform a TEE to better evaluate the heart valves and structures for any complications that might explain the lack of clinical improvement.",9
802,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of scleroderma renal crisis, which is characterized by acute renal failure, hypertension, and hyperkalemia. The chronic diarrhea and gastroesophageal reflux disease, along with the hand pain and mobility issues, suggest systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). In scleroderma renal crisis, the most appropriate treatment is an ACE inhibitor, such as captopril, which helps control the hypertension and renal involvement by reducing the effects of angiotensin II and decreasing the pressure in the renal arterioles. Other options like furosemide, labetalol, and nifedipine do not address the underlying pathophysiology of scleroderma renal crisis as effectively as an ACE inhibitor.",9
813,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) with associated giant cell arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis. The key features include the age of the patient (over 50), the presence of headache, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and symptoms of PMR such as pain and stiffness in the shoulders and hips. The headache, fever, and elevated ESR are indicative of GCA, a large-vessel vasculitis. The normal creatine kinase level helps differentiate PMR from other myopathies. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of the headache is large-vessel vasculitis.",9
812,"The patient is undergoing an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) which is used to screen for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The abnormal result indicates that she may have GDM. Risk factors for GDM include obesity, advanced maternal age, family history of diabetes, and previous history of GDM or large-for-gestational-age babies. In this case, the patient's pre-pregnancy BMI can be calculated using her weight and height. Her pre-pregnancy weight was 73 kg and her height is 155 cm, which gives a BMI of approximately 30.4 kg/m², classifying her as obese. Obesity is a known risk factor for gestational diabetes. The other options, such as age, history of pre-eclampsia, and history of a small-for-gestational-age baby, are not direct risk factors for GDM.",9
807,"The histologic appearance described in the biopsy specimen is consistent with proliferative endometrium. This phase is characterized by straight, tubular glands lined with pseudostratified columnar epithelial cells and high mitotic activity, which is typical of the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle. This phase is driven by estrogen, which stimulates the proliferation of the endometrial lining. Aromatase is the enzyme responsible for converting androgens to estrogens, thereby increasing estrogen levels. Therefore, increased activity of aromatase would lead to increased estrogen production, which is directly responsible for the proliferative changes seen in the endometrium.",9
810,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of cutaneous anthrax, which is caused by Bacillus anthracis. The key features include painless, pruritic lesions that progress from papules to vesicles to ulcers with surrounding edema, and associated lymphadenopathy. The fever and headache are systemic symptoms. The greatest risk factor for cutaneous anthrax is exposure to animal products, particularly wool, hides, or hair from infected animals, which is known as ""wool sorter's disease."" Therefore, handling wool is the most relevant risk factor in this context.",9
819,"The patient presents with irregular menstrual cycles, acne, hirsutism, and hyperpigmentation, along with elevated fasting glucose, suggesting insulin resistance. The laboratory findings show elevated LH and FSH levels, with a significantly elevated LH:FSH ratio, and elevated testosterone levels. These findings are consistent with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), which is characterized by hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction. The elevated fasting glucose and acanthosis nigricans (hyperpigmentation) further support insulin resistance, commonly associated with PCOS. 

The best initial treatment for managing irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenic symptoms in PCOS is oral contraceptives. They help regulate menstrual cycles, reduce androgen levels, and improve acne and hirsutism. Clomiphene and letrozole are used for ovulation induction in patients desiring pregnancy, which is not the case here. Goserelin, a GnRH agonist, is not typically used for PCOS management.",9
820,"The patient's presentation is classic for gout, which is characterized by the sudden onset of pain, swelling, and redness in a joint, often the big toe (podagra). The risk factors include alcohol consumption and chronic kidney disease, both of which can lead to increased uric acid levels. In gout, joint fluid analysis typically shows negatively birefringent monosodium urate crystals under polarized light microscopy. This is in contrast to pseudogout, which would show positively birefringent calcium pyrophosphate crystals. The other options, such as low glucose or normal findings, are not consistent with the acute inflammatory presentation described.",9
821,"The patient presents with symptoms and findings suggestive of a gastrinoma (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome), which is characterized by peptic ulcers, especially in unusual locations like the jejunum, and symptoms that improve with acid suppression (ranitidine). The presence of hypercalcemia (Ca2+: 13.5 mg/dL) and bilateral hemianopsia suggests a possible pituitary adenoma, which, along with gynecomastia, could indicate a prolactinoma. These findings are consistent with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), which involves tumors of the parathyroid glands, pituitary gland, and pancreas (gastrinoma). The mutation of the MEN1 gene is responsible for this syndrome. The other options do not explain the combination of symptoms and findings: Helicobacter pylori infection typically causes gastric ulcers, not hypercalcemia or pituitary issues; APC gene mutations are associated with familial adenomatous polyposis, not these endocrine findings; RET gene mutations are associated with MEN2, which involves medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and hyperparathyroidism, but not gastrinomas or pituitary tumors.",9
823,"The patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of ""locked-in syndrome,"" which is characterized by quadriplegia and anarthria with preserved consciousness and vertical eye movements. This condition is typically caused by an occlusion of the basilar artery, which supplies the pons. The pons is responsible for motor control, and its damage can lead to paralysis of all voluntary muscles except for those controlling eye movements, particularly vertical eye movements. Therefore, the most likely vessel occluded in this scenario is the basilar artery.",9
825,"The infant presents with features suggestive of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which include microcephaly, facial abnormalities (such as thin lips and a smooth philtrum), and developmental issues. The presence of a systolic murmur could indicate a congenital heart defect, which is also associated with FAS. These features are consistent with prenatal alcohol exposure. Identifying and preventing alcohol consumption early in pregnancy can prevent the development of fetal alcohol syndrome. Other options, such as phenytoin usage, maternal toxoplasmosis, and maternal hypothyroidism, are associated with different sets of congenital issues and do not match the clinical presentation as closely as alcohol consumption does.",9
829,"The patient has developed an intra-abdominal abscess following bowel surgery, which is a common complication due to bacterial contamination. The CT scan confirms the presence of an abscess. Intra-abdominal abscesses following bowel surgery are often polymicrobial, but the most common anaerobic organism involved is Bacteroides fragilis, which is part of the normal flora of the colon. Salmonella enteritidis is typically associated with gastroenteritis and not abscess formation. Enterococcus species and Streptococcus bovis are less commonly associated with abscesses in this context compared to Bacteroides fragilis.",9
795,"The patient's symptoms are characteristic of plantar fasciitis, which typically presents with heel pain that is worse with the first steps in the morning or after a period of rest, and improves with activity but may worsen with prolonged activity (such as dancing). Examination findings often reveal tenderness on the plantar aspect of the heel, especially with dorsiflexion of the foot. The best initial management for plantar fasciitis involves conservative measures, specifically resting the foot. This allows the inflamed plantar fascia to heal. Other conservative treatments may include stretching exercises, ice application, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).",9
828,"The patient presents with a single, red, crusty lesion on the shaft of his penis and a similar lesion on his finger. The lesions are painless, and previous treatments for syphilis and eczema were ineffective. The biopsy shows nuclear hyperchromasia, multinucleation, and increased mitotic figures, which are indicative of dysplastic or neoplastic changes.

Bowenoid papulosis (A) typically presents as multiple papules rather than a single lesion and is associated with HPV, often in younger individuals.

Lichen sclerosus (B) is a chronic inflammatory condition that presents with white, atrophic plaques, not red, crusty lesions.

Bowen's disease (C) is a form of squamous cell carcinoma in situ that can present as a red, scaly plaque on the skin, including the genital area. It can occur on non-genital skin as well, which fits the presentation of a similar lesion on the finger.

Erythroplasia of Queyrat (D) is a term used specifically for Bowen's disease of the glans penis, presenting as a red, velvety plaque. However, the lesion is on the shaft, not the glans, and there is a similar lesion on the finger.

Given the presentation of a red, crusty lesion on both the penile shaft and finger, and the biopsy findings, Bowen's disease (C) is the most likely diagnosis.",9
835,"The patient's murmur is a holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border that increases with inspiration, which is characteristic of tricuspid regurgitation. During inspiration, intrathoracic pressure decreases, leading to increased venous return to the right side of the heart. This results in increased right ventricular stroke volume, which in turn increases the intensity of the tricuspid regurgitation murmur. Therefore, the hemodynamic change responsible for the increase in the murmur is increased right ventricular stroke volume.",10
832,"The patient has a history of antiphospholipid syndrome and presents with symptoms and findings suggestive of pulmonary hypertension (PH), as indicated by the elevated mean pulmonary arterial pressure (30 mm Hg) and normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (10 mm Hg). This suggests pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension, likely due to chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), which is a known complication of antiphospholipid syndrome due to recurrent pulmonary emboli.

In CTEPH, the obstruction of pulmonary arteries leads to increased pressure in the pulmonary circulation, causing right heart strain and jugular venous distention. Over time, this can lead to right heart failure, but it does not directly affect the left heart or cause left-sided heart failure symptoms such as pulmonary edema.

Hemosiderin-laden macrophages (also known as ""heart failure cells"") are typically found in the lungs in cases of pulmonary congestion due to left-sided heart failure, where increased pulmonary venous pressure leads to extravasation of red blood cells into the alveoli, which are then phagocytosed by macrophages. However, in this case, the normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure indicates that left-sided heart failure is not present.

Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient, given the context of pulmonary hypertension due to antiphospholipid syndrome, would be dilation of the coronary sinus due to increased right atrial pressure, which is a consequence of elevated pulmonary artery pressure and right heart strain.",9
839,"The patient is experiencing withdrawal symptoms after being administered an opioid in the hospital. This suggests that the opioid given is acting as a partial agonist or antagonist at the opioid receptors, precipitating withdrawal in someone who is opioid-dependent. Butorphanol is a mixed agonist-antagonist opioid, which can precipitate withdrawal symptoms in patients who are dependent on full agonists like opium. The other options (hydrocodone, fentanyl, oxycodone) are full agonists and would not typically cause withdrawal symptoms in an opioid-dependent patient.",9
853,"The patient is experiencing symptoms consistent with dehydration, likely due to diarrhea from a recent trip to South America. Dehydration leads to decreased urine volume and increased urine concentration, which is reflected in the yellow color of the urine. The nephron segment primarily responsible for concentrating urine is the Loop of Henle. The Loop of Henle, particularly the thick ascending limb, plays a crucial role in creating a hyperosmotic medullary interstitium, which is essential for water reabsorption in the collecting ducts. This process is critical for concentrating urine and conserving water during states of dehydration.",9
852,"The clinical presentation of the 3-year-old boy includes developmental delay, self-mutilating behavior (head banging, lip and tongue lacerations, finger wounds), and neurological findings such as increased muscle tone. Laboratory findings show macrocytic anemia (elevated MCV), elevated creatinine, and significantly elevated uric acid levels. These findings are characteristic of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, which is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). This enzyme deficiency leads to an overproduction of uric acid, resulting in hyperuricemia, and is associated with neurological and behavioral abnormalities, including self-mutilation. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's findings is hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency.",9
858,"The patient's presentation of multiple colorectal adenomas and a family history of colorectal cancer suggests a hereditary condition. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is characterized by the development of numerous adenomatous polyps in the colon and rectum, often leading to colorectal cancer if untreated. FAP is caused by mutations in the APC gene. The other genes listed are associated with different conditions: RAS is involved in various cancers, TP53 is a tumor suppressor gene involved in many cancers, and hMLH1 is associated with Lynch syndrome, which typically presents with fewer polyps. Therefore, the gene most likely affected in this patient is APC.",9
859,"In a patient with a high-energy trauma such as jumping from a building, it is crucial to assess for potential injuries beyond the obvious fractures. The patient has bilateral femur fractures and hip pain, suggesting possible pelvic or hip injuries. However, the cervical spine has not been evaluated, which is critical in trauma cases to rule out any cervical spine injuries. Therefore, imaging should include the cervical spine, hips, and potentially other areas that might be affected by the trauma. Option C, which includes AP and lateral radiographs of the hips, knees, lumbar, and cervical area, provides a comprehensive assessment of the areas most likely to be injured in such a fall, including the crucial cervical spine.",9
865,"The child presents with severe burns on sun-exposed areas, and the parents mention that they rarely apply sunscreen. This suggests that the burns are likely due to sun exposure. UV-B radiation is known to cause sunburns, especially in individuals with fair skin who are more susceptible to UV damage. Infrared radiation is associated with heat but not typically with causing burns in this context. Child abuse is unlikely given the specific pattern of sun-exposed areas being affected. Ionizing radiation is not relevant in this scenario. Therefore, UV-B radiation is the most likely cause of the burns.",9
866,"The patient presents with fever, abdominal pain, leukocytosis, and altered mental status three days post-surgery. The abdominal incision appears dry and non-erythematous, making wound contamination less likely. The presence of wheezing suggests COPD exacerbation, but the primary symptoms are abdominal. The urine analysis shows significant pyuria (WBC 32–38/hpf), indicating a urinary tract infection, likely due to bladder outlet obstruction, especially given the patient's history of benign prostatic hyperplasia. This obstruction can lead to urinary stasis and infection, explaining the fever, leukocytosis, and altered mental status (possibly due to urosepsis).",9
868,"The patient presents with symptoms of heart failure, including shortness of breath at rest and with exertion, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. These symptoms, along with the history of a recent myocardial infarction and the echocardiogram showing a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (33%), suggest systolic heart failure. In this context, the appropriate management includes medications that improve survival and symptoms in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). 

ACE inhibitors, such as captopril, are a cornerstone of therapy for HFrEF. They help reduce mortality, improve symptoms, and prevent disease progression. Verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, is not indicated in systolic heart failure as it can worsen heart failure. Levofloxacin is an antibiotic and not relevant to this case. Nitroglycerin is used for symptomatic relief of angina or acute heart failure but does not address the underlying heart failure management.

Therefore, the best choice for starting treatment in this patient is an ACE inhibitor like captopril.",9

870,"The patient's symptoms and findings are suggestive of a fungal infection. The chest x-ray shows hilar lymphadenopathy and nodules with central calcifications, which are characteristic of histoplasmosis. The urine studies showing a polysaccharide antigen and the biopsy findings of cells with basophilic, crescent-shaped nuclei and pericellular halos within macrophages further support this diagnosis. Histoplasmosis is commonly associated with exposure to bat droppings or bird droppings, particularly in endemic areas like the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys. Therefore, the patient's history is most likely to show exposure to bat droppings.",9
876,"The patient presents with signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease, including jaundice, ascites, and gynecomastia. The laboratory findings show a low platelet count, elevated AST and ALT with AST > ALT, and elevated GGT, which are suggestive of liver dysfunction. The history of heavy alcohol consumption is a significant clue. The AST to ALT ratio greater than 2:1 is characteristic of alcoholic liver disease. The presence of gynecomastia and ascites further supports liver cirrhosis, likely due to alcohol. The transferrin saturation and ferritin levels are not markedly elevated, making hemochromatosis less likely. Chronic viral hepatitis would typically present with different transaminase patterns and history. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is less likely given the alcohol history and lab findings.",9
817,,0
878,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, which is a tumor of the adrenal gland that secretes catecholamines, leading to symptoms such as headaches, palpitations, and sweating. The elevated serum metanephrines and normetanephrines support this diagnosis. The family history of thyroid cancer and the patient's symptoms suggest a possible genetic syndrome. Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) is associated with medullary thyroid cancer and pheochromocytoma. MEN 2 is caused by mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. Therefore, the mutation responsible for this patient's condition is likely in the RET proto-oncogene.",9
882,"During fasting, muscle proteins are broken down into amino acids, which are then used for gluconeogenesis in the liver. The nitrogen from these amino acids needs to be transported to the liver for conversion into urea. Alanine is the primary amino acid that transports nitrogen from muscle to the liver. In the liver, alanine is converted to pyruvate, and the nitrogen is transferred to the urea cycle. This process is known as the glucose-alanine cycle.",9
883,"The patient has developed acute kidney injury (AKI) following an acute myocardial infarction, as indicated by oliguria and elevated BUN and creatinine levels. The renal biopsy shows necrosis of the proximal tubules and thick ascending limb of Henle's loop, which is characteristic of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). In ATN, the most common urinary finding is the presence of muddy brown casts, which are granular casts formed from the necrotic tubular epithelial cells. These casts are indicative of tubular damage and are a hallmark of ATN.",9
885,"The patient has a fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus, which commonly affects the axillary nerve. The axillary nerve innervates the deltoid and teres minor muscles. The loss of sensation over the upper lateral aspect of the arm and shoulder also suggests axillary nerve involvement, as this nerve provides sensory innervation to this area. Among the options given, teres minor is the muscle supplied by the axillary nerve.",9
864,,0
880,"The patient presents with bilateral eye pain, redness, blurry vision, and photophobia, along with leukocytes in the anterior chamber (indicative of anterior uveitis or iritis). The history of eye surgery following trauma suggests a possible autoimmune reaction. Sympathetic ophthalmia is a condition where trauma to one eye leads to an autoimmune response affecting both eyes, often due to exposure to retinal antigens. This fits the presentation of bilateral uveitis following previous eye trauma and surgery.",9
887,"The clinical presentation suggests a condition associated with bone marrow failure and physical anomalies. The recurrent nosebleeds, low platelet count, anemia, and leukopenia indicate pancytopenia. The presence of hyperpigmented macules and growth retardation, along with the hematologic findings, are characteristic of Fanconi anemia. Fanconi anemia is caused by a defect in DNA repair, specifically in the repair of DNA crosslinks. The bilateral esotropia and history of recurrent infections further support a diagnosis of Fanconi anemia, which is associated with congenital anomalies and increased susceptibility to infections due to bone marrow failure.",9
890,"The artery in question is the superior thyroid artery, which is known to travel with the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. The superior thyroid artery is a branch of the external carotid artery. During parathyroidectomy, injury to this artery can occur, especially if there is bleeding that needs to be controlled. The superior thyroid artery originates from the external carotid artery, making option C the correct choice.",9
891,"The patient is experiencing an asthma exacerbation with symptoms such as cough, wheezing, and chest tightness. His oxygen saturation is 92%, indicating moderate hypoxemia. The question asks for a feature that categorizes the condition as life-threatening. Life-threatening asthma is characterized by severe symptoms that can include altered mental status, silent chest, cyanosis, or respiratory failure. Respiratory acidosis indicates hypoventilation and CO2 retention, which is a sign of respiratory failure and a life-threatening condition. The other options do not indicate life-threatening status: PEFR >70% suggests mild obstruction, dyspnea limiting activity is common in severe but not necessarily life-threatening asthma, and symptoms lasting >3 days do not indicate immediate life-threatening status.",9
898,"The patient is 16 years old and sexually active. Current guidelines recommend starting cervical cancer screening at age 21, regardless of sexual activity. Therefore, cytology (Pap smear) and HPV testing are not indicated at this age. However, the HPV vaccine is recommended for individuals starting at age 11-12, and catch-up vaccination is recommended up to age 26. Since the patient has not received the HPV vaccine, administering it is appropriate. Thus, the best next step is to administer the HPV vaccine and not perform any HPV-related screening at this time.",9
893,"The symptoms described in the vignette are consistent with mild intermittent asthma. The boy experiences wheezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing, particularly during physical activity and in certain seasons, which are common triggers for asthma. His symptoms occur about once a week but do not affect his sleep or limit his daily activities, suggesting a mild form of asthma. The expiratory flow rate is around 85%, which is relatively normal, indicating that his lung function is not severely compromised. For mild intermittent asthma, the recommended treatment is a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) for quick relief of symptoms. Inhaled albuterol is a SABA and is the appropriate choice for managing acute asthma symptoms in this scenario.",9
899,"The boy has beta thalassemia, which is a disorder caused by mutations affecting the beta-globin gene. The key finding here is that the protein is longer than normal, with 160 amino acids instead of the usual 146. This suggests that the mutation has led to the addition of extra amino acids. A frameshift mutation, caused by insertions or deletions that are not in multiples of three, would typically result in a completely different and often nonfunctional protein, but it could also lead to a longer protein if it causes a shift in the reading frame that bypasses the normal stop codon. A missense mutation results in a single amino acid change and would not typically change the length of the protein. A nonsense mutation introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a shorter protein. A splice site mutation can lead to abnormal splicing, potentially resulting in an elongated protein if intronic sequences are included in the mRNA. Given the information, a splice site mutation is the most likely cause of the elongated protein.",9
900,"The patient's symptoms include infertility, pelvic and back pain, and painful diarrhea, which are cyclical and occur monthly. These symptoms are suggestive of endometriosis, a condition where endometrial tissue is found outside the uterine cavity. The pain associated with endometriosis is often related to the menstrual cycle, and the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus can lead to inflammation and scarring, contributing to infertility. The unremarkable hysterosalpingogram suggests that there is no significant scarring or blockage in the fallopian tubes, which makes scarring of the fallopian tubes less likely. The regular menstrual cycles and the absence of abnormalities on examination also make primary ovarian failure and a smooth muscle tumor (such as a fibroid) less likely. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity.",9
905,"The patient presents with confusion, agitation, fever, tachycardia, hyperreflexia, and clonus. These symptoms are suggestive of serotonin syndrome, a condition that can occur due to an excess of serotonin in the central nervous system. The patient's medication regimen includes fluoxetine (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) and selegiline (a monoamine oxidase inhibitor), both of which increase serotonin levels. The recent addition of selegiline likely led to an excessive increase in serotonin, causing serotonin syndrome. The absence of oxycodone and clonazepam withdrawal symptoms, such as seizures or severe anxiety, makes withdrawal less likely. The fever and autonomic instability are not typical of a bacterial or viral infection without other specific signs. Electrolyte abnormalities would not typically cause hyperreflexia and clonus. Therefore, the most likely etiology is a medication complication due to the interaction between fluoxetine and selegiline.",9
908,"The patient's symptoms are suggestive of neurogenic claudication, which is often due to lumbar spinal stenosis. The key features include back pain that worsens with standing and improves with sitting. The normal neurologic exam and strong peripheral pulses make vascular claudication less likely. Ankle-brachial index is used to assess peripheral artery disease, which is not indicated here given the normal pulses and symptom pattern. Radiography of the lumbosacral spine is not the best initial test for suspected spinal stenosis. MRI of the lumbosacral spine is the most appropriate next step to evaluate for spinal stenosis. Naproxen is a symptomatic treatment but does not address the underlying issue.",9
907,"The scenario describes twins with significant differences in size and hematocrit levels, suggesting twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), which occurs in monochorionic pregnancies. TTTS is characterized by one twin (the donor) being smaller and anemic, while the other twin (the recipient) is larger and polycythemic. The presence of TTTS indicates a shared placenta, which is a feature of monochorionic twins. Among the options, only B and D are monochorionic. However, monochorionic-monoamniotic twins (option D) are rare and typically have more severe complications. The description fits monochorionic-diamniotic twins (option B), which are more common and can present with TTTS.",9
914,"The clinical scenario describes an incidental finding of a mass of tissue joining the inferior poles of both kidneys, which is characteristic of a horseshoe kidney. In horseshoe kidney, the inferior poles of the kidneys are fused, and the kidneys are located lower in the abdomen because their ascent is limited by the inferior mesenteric artery. This condition is associated with an increased risk of ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) due to the abnormal position and structure of the kidneys. The other options do not accurately describe the typical characteristics or complications associated with horseshoe kidney. Therefore, the best description of this renal anomaly is its association with UPJO.",9
919,"The symptoms described in the vignette suggest a condition related to defective absorption of a vitamin, leading to photosensitivity, skin changes, and neurological symptoms. The combination of sun sensitivity, skin rash, and neurological issues points towards Hartnup disease, a disorder affecting the absorption of tryptophan. Tryptophan is a precursor for niacin (Vitamin B3). In Hartnup disease, due to defective absorption of tryptophan, there is a deficiency in niacin, leading to pellagra-like symptoms: dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia. Therefore, the vitamin likely to be low in this patient is niacin.",9
912,"The patient's symptoms include aggressive behavior, irritability, tachycardia, hypertension, dilated pupils, diaphoresis, and rapid speech. These symptoms are consistent with a sympathomimetic toxidrome, which can be caused by substances like cocaine or amphetamines. The rapid resolution of symptoms after sedation and the context of stress and reclusiveness suggest a stimulant use. 

Caffeine intoxication is unlikely to cause such severe symptoms, especially the aggressive behavior and significant autonomic instability. Phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication often presents with nystagmus, hallucinations, and can cause severe agitation, but the rapid resolution of symptoms is less typical. 

Cocaine intoxication is characterized by similar symptoms, but the context of the scenario and the rapid resolution after sedation suggest a longer-acting stimulant like an amphetamine. Lisdexamfetamine, an amphetamine, fits the profile of causing prolonged sympathomimetic effects and behavioral changes, which resolve with treatment.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Lisdexamfetamine intoxication.",9
921,"The patient's symptoms include worsening shortness of breath, cough, and weight loss, along with a significant smoking history. The physical examination shows decreased breath sounds, and the oxygen saturation is slightly low at 93%. These findings are consistent with a chronic lung condition. The flow-volume loop, although not visible here, would typically show an obstructive pattern in cases of COPD, characterized by a scooped-out appearance on the expiratory limb. Given the patient's long smoking history and the presentation of symptoms, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the most likely cause. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis would present with restrictive lung disease patterns and crackles on examination, while an endotracheal neoplasm or unilateral mainstem obstruction would likely cause more localized findings and possibly stridor or wheezing.",9
924,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are suggestive of an infection in the pelvic region. She has lower abdominal pain, fever, and cervical motion tenderness, which are classic signs of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The purulent cervical discharge and the history of inconsistent condom use with a sexual partner increase the likelihood of a sexually transmitted infection, which is a common cause of PID. The elevated leukocyte count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate further support an inflammatory process. Pyelonephritis typically presents with flank pain and urinary symptoms, which are not the primary complaints here. An ectopic pregnancy would be considered if there were signs of pregnancy or a missed period, but her last menstrual period was 3 weeks ago, making this less likely. Appendicitis usually presents with right lower quadrant pain and does not typically cause cervical motion tenderness or purulent discharge. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is pelvic inflammatory disease.",9
922,"The patient is a 17-year-old girl with primary amenorrhea, normal secondary sexual characteristics (Tanner V breast and pubic hair development), and a shortened vagina with no visible cervix on examination. These findings suggest a condition where there is normal ovarian function (as evidenced by normal secondary sexual characteristics) but an absence of the uterus and upper two-thirds of the vagina. This is consistent with Müllerian agenesis (Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome), where the Müllerian ducts fail to develop, leading to the absence of the uterus and upper vagina. Normal hormone levels and karyotype further support this diagnosis, as individuals with Müllerian agenesis typically have a normal 46,XX karyotype and normal ovarian function.",9
925,"The patient's symptoms and findings are suggestive of sarcoidosis, which is characterized by noncaseating granulomas, bilateral hilar adenopathy, and a high CD4:CD8 ratio in bronchoalveolar lavage. Sarcoidosis is more common in African American individuals, making race a significant predisposing factor. While exposure to beryllium can cause a similar condition (berylliosis), the strongest predisposing factor for sarcoidosis in this case is the patient's race.",9
926,"The patient's family history and the findings from the colonoscopy suggest a hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome. The presence of nonpolyposis colorectal cancer in multiple family members, especially at relatively young ages, is indicative of Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, HNPCC). Lynch syndrome is characterized by microsatellite instability (MSI) due to defects in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system. This leads to an increased risk of colorectal cancer and other cancers. The right-sided location of the adenoma and the histopathological findings further support this diagnosis. Therefore, the condition of this patient is best explained by microsatellite instability.",9
931,"The patient experienced hypotension and tachycardia shortly after the initiation of a continuous infusion of bupivacaine via an epidural catheter. This is a common occurrence due to sympathetic blockade caused by the local anesthetic. Epidural anesthesia can block sympathetic nerve fibers, leading to vasodilation and decreased systemic vascular resistance, which results in hypotension. The compensatory tachycardia is a response to maintain cardiac output. The fact that the patient is asymptomatic and the fetal heart rate is stable supports this explanation. Intrathecal infiltration would likely cause more profound motor block and possibly more severe hypotension. Local anesthetic systemic toxicity would present with neurological or cardiac symptoms, which are not present here. The Bainbridge reflex is not relevant in this context.",9
933,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of an ovarian mass, including increased abdominal girth, weight loss, and ascites (indicated by shifting dullness). The presence of a left adnexal mass on bimanual examination further supports this. Given her age and the presentation, ovarian cancer is a strong consideration. CA-125 is a tumor marker that is often elevated in ovarian cancer, particularly epithelial ovarian cancer, which is common in postmenopausal women. The other options are less likely: endometrial proliferation is not directly related to her symptoms, a chocolate cyst is associated with endometriosis (less likely given her age and presentation), and cervical dysplasia is unlikely given her negative HPV test and the current presentation focused on an adnexal mass.",9
929,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with anticholinergic toxicity, likely due to the ingestion of wild berries containing anticholinergic compounds. Symptoms include confusion, agitation, hyperthermia, dry skin, dry mucous membranes, dilated pupils, and decreased bowel sounds. The treatment for anticholinergic toxicity is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that can cross the blood-brain barrier to increase acetylcholine levels and counteract the effects of anticholinergic agents. Physostigmine is a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that can cross the blood-brain barrier, making it effective in treating central and peripheral symptoms of anticholinergic toxicity. Neostigmine does not cross the blood-brain barrier, and scopolamine is an anticholinergic agent, which would worsen the symptoms. Rivastigmine is used for Alzheimer's disease and is not typically used for acute anticholinergic toxicity.",9
928,"The patient is a young Turkish female presenting with fatigue and conjunctival pallor, suggesting anemia. Her lab results show a low hemoglobin level (10.2 g/dL) and low mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 65 µm^3, indicating microcytic anemia. The family history of similar symptoms suggests a hereditary condition. In individuals of Mediterranean descent, such as Turkish people, thalassemia is a common cause of microcytic anemia. Thalassemia is associated with mutations affecting hemoglobin production. Specifically, beta-thalassemia is caused by point mutations on chromosome 11, affecting the beta-globin gene. This aligns with the patient's presentation and lab findings, making option A the most likely cause of her anemia.",9
934,"The patient has a non-displaced fracture of the middle third of the clavicle. Clavicle fractures are common and typically occur in the middle third. Non-displaced fractures are usually managed conservatively. Surgical options like open reduction and internal fixation are generally reserved for displaced fractures or those with complications. A figure-of-eight splint is a traditional method for conservative management, but it can be uncomfortable and is not always necessary. Current practice often favors simple arm slings for comfort and early mobilization. However, the question asks for the most appropriate treatment, and given the options, figure-of-eight splinting is the conservative treatment listed. Mobilization is not appropriate immediately after the injury without initial immobilization to allow for healing.",9
935,"The patient is HIV-positive with a CD4+ count of 480 cells/mm3. Live vaccines are generally contraindicated in patients with CD4+ counts below 200 cells/mm3. However, this patient's CD4+ count is above that threshold, allowing for some live vaccines to be considered. The Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine is not recommended for HIV-positive individuals due to the risk of disseminated BCG infection. The yellow fever vaccine is also a live vaccine and is generally avoided in HIV-positive patients unless the risk of yellow fever is high and the CD4+ count is above 200 cells/mm3. The measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine is a live vaccine, but it is recommended for HIV-positive patients with CD4+ counts above 200 cells/mm3 who do not have evidence of immunity. Since the patient's immunization records are unknown, he may not have received the MMR vaccine or may not be immune. Therefore, the most appropriate recommendation is to administer the MMR vaccine.",9
936,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible foreign body or corneal abrasion due to his occupation and the sudden onset of eye pain while drilling metal. The best initial step in management for suspected corneal abrasion or foreign body is to perform a fluorescein stain. This test will help visualize any corneal abrasions or foreign bodies by highlighting them under a blue light. Other options like orbital MRI or tonometry are not appropriate as initial steps in this scenario, and topical corticosteroids are contraindicated without a clear diagnosis.",9
937,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of a pleural effusion secondary to pneumonia, likely due to aspiration given his history of alcohol use and poor dentition. The loculated pleural effusion and consolidation with air bronchograms on chest x-ray suggest a complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema. In such cases, the pleural fluid is typically exudative, with high protein and LDH levels, and often shows low glucose levels due to the high metabolic activity of bacteria and white blood cells. A glucose level of 30 mg/dL in the pleural fluid is characteristic of empyema or complicated parapneumonic effusion.",9
940,"The symptoms described by the patient, such as increased thirst and urination (polydipsia and polyuria), along with confusion and agitation, are suggestive of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. This condition is a known side effect of lithium therapy. Lithium is commonly used in the treatment of bipolar disorder and can cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus by affecting the kidneys' ability to concentrate urine. The other medications listed, such as amitriptyline, valproic acid, and carbamazepine, do not typically cause these specific symptoms related to increased thirst and urination.",9
939,"The patient's symptoms of agitation, confusion, fever, sore throat, hydrophobia (refusal to drink), drooling, and increased muscle tone suggest a neurological condition. The history of exploring caves is significant because it raises the suspicion of rabies, which can be contracted from bat exposure in caves. Rabies is a viral infection that affects the central nervous system and can lead to encephalitis. The prevention of rabies after potential exposure involves post-exposure prophylaxis, which includes the administration of rabies immunoglobulin and vaccination. This would prevent the onset of the disease if administered promptly after exposure.",9
938,"The patient presented with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), which was confirmed by the presence of leukocyte esterase and nitrites in the urine culture. She was treated with an antibiotic, and now she reports a new rash and increased sensitivity to sunlight, suggesting photosensitivity. Among the antibiotics listed, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (option C) is known to cause photosensitivity reactions. Cephalexin and ceftriaxone are cephalosporins and are not typically associated with photosensitivity. Azithromycin is a macrolide and also not commonly associated with photosensitivity. Therefore, the antibiotic most likely prescribed, which can cause photosensitivity, is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.",9
941,"The patient's symptoms and travel history suggest typhoid fever, caused by Salmonella typhi. The key symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea following constipation, and a characteristic rash (rose spots). The most effective treatment for typhoid fever, especially in regions like India where resistance patterns are known, is a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin. Metronidazole is used for anaerobic infections and protozoal infections, oral vancomycin is used for C. difficile infections, and penicillin is not effective against Salmonella typhi.",9
906,,0
948,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a metabolic myopathy, specifically McArdle disease (glycogen storage disease type V). This condition is characterized by muscle cramps and myoglobinuria after exercise, due to a deficiency in muscle glycogen phosphorylase. The key laboratory finding is the presence of myoglobinuria (indicated by 3+ blood on dipstick without RBCs) and the failure of lactate to rise during ischemic exercise testing, as seen in this patient. The muscle biopsy in McArdle disease typically shows subsarcolemmal glycogen deposits, which are acid-Schiff positive.",9
949,"The patient presents with a painful, burning red rash on his face and hands after brief sun exposure. He is taking demeclocycline, which is known to cause photosensitivity reactions. Photosensitivity reactions can occur with certain medications, leading to exaggerated sunburn-like symptoms even with minimal sun exposure. The timing of the rash (30 minutes after sun exposure) and the areas affected (face and hands) are consistent with a photosensitivity reaction. Uroporphyrin accumulation (A) would suggest porphyria, which typically presents with blistering lesions rather than an immediate burning rash. Systemic lupus erythematosus (B) could cause a photosensitive rash, but there is no mention of other systemic symptoms or a history of lupus. A normal sunburn reaction (D) would not occur so quickly or with such minimal exposure in someone who is accustomed to occasional sunburns. Therefore, the most likely cause of the symptoms is the use of demeclocycline.",9
954,"The newborn in this scenario presents with central cyanosis, a continuous machine-like murmur, and echocardiographic findings consistent with transposition of the great arteries (TGA) with a ventricular septal defect (VSD). The continuous murmur suggests a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), which is common in TGA as it allows some mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. TGA is a congenital heart defect where the aorta and pulmonary artery are switched, leading to parallel rather than series circulation. This condition is associated with maternal diabetes, particularly pregestational diabetes, which can lead to elevated fasting blood glucose levels. Therefore, further evaluation of the mother is most likely to show elevated fasting blood glucose.",9
958,"The clinical presentation suggests a glycogen storage disease. The key features include poor growth, protuberant abdomen, enlarged cheeks, hypoglycemia, elevated blood lactate levels, and no response to glucagon stimulation. These findings are characteristic of Von Gierke's disease (Glycogen Storage Disease Type I), which is caused by a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphatase. This enzyme is responsible for the final step in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, converting glucose-6-phosphate to glucose. Without this enzyme, glucose cannot be released into the bloodstream, leading to hypoglycemia and accumulation of glycogen in the liver, causing hepatomegaly (protuberant abdomen). The elevated lactate levels are due to impaired gluconeogenesis. The lack of response to glucagon is because the pathway to release glucose is blocked at the glucose-6-phosphatase step.",9
962,"The patient is experiencing symptoms consistent with tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), which is a common complication after chemotherapy for cancers with high cell turnover, such as Burkitt’s lymphoma. TLS is characterized by the release of intracellular contents into the bloodstream, leading to hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, and acute kidney injury. The elevated potassium, low calcium, high phosphorus, high uric acid, and acute kidney injury (elevated creatinine) in this patient are indicative of TLS. Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that reduces the production of uric acid, thereby preventing the precipitation of uric acid crystals in the renal tubules and reducing the risk of acute kidney injury. Therefore, administering allopurinol before starting chemotherapy could have prevented the development of TLS in this patient.",9
960,"The patient's symptoms and clinical findings are suggestive of endometriosis. She has recurrent pelvic pain associated with her menstrual cycle, pain during intercourse (dyspareunia), and a tender adnexal mass, which are classic signs of endometriosis. Endometriosis is characterized by the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterine cavity, commonly within the peritoneal cavity. This ectopic endometrial tissue responds to hormonal changes and can cause pain and the formation of masses or cysts, such as endometriomas, which could explain the tender adnexal mass found on examination. The other options do not fit the clinical picture as well:",9
968,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with iron deficiency anemia, which is characterized by microcytic, hypochromic red blood cells. Her history of taking aspirin and omeprazole could contribute to gastrointestinal blood loss or decreased iron absorption, respectively. In iron deficiency anemia, the body lacks sufficient iron to produce hemoglobin, leading to decreased red blood cell production. This results in a low reticulocyte count because the bone marrow is unable to produce new red blood cells effectively due to the lack of iron. Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient is a decrease in her reticulocyte count.",9
967,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder (MDD), including fatigue, difficulty concentrating, anhedonia (loss of interest in activities), and a flat affect. His vital signs and physical examination are normal, and there is no evidence of psychosis or suicidal ideation. The most appropriate treatment for MDD, especially in a young adult, is typically a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) such as escitalopram. Reassurance alone is not sufficient given the duration and impact of symptoms. Diazepam is used for anxiety or muscle relaxation, not depression. Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant, which is not first-line due to its side effect profile.",9
966,"The patient has endometrial hyperplasia with atypia, which is a precancerous condition. Given her desire to preserve fertility, a hysterectomy (options A and B) would not be appropriate as it would eliminate her ability to conceive. Observation with annual biopsies (option D) is not sufficient due to the atypia, which carries a higher risk of progression to cancer. The best approach to manage endometrial hyperplasia with atypia while preserving fertility is to use progestin therapy (option C), which can help reverse the hyperplasia and allow for future pregnancy attempts.",9
973,"The patient has a 4-month history of depressive symptoms, including feeling sad, sleeping and eating very little, and inability to focus. She also has auditory hallucinations, which started 7 months ago. The key points are the duration and the presence of both mood and psychotic symptoms. Schizophrenia requires at least 6 months of symptoms, primarily psychotic. Schizophreniform disorder is similar to schizophrenia but lasts 1-6 months. Schizoaffective disorder involves both mood disorder and psychotic symptoms, with the psychotic symptoms occurring for at least 2 weeks without mood symptoms. Schizotypal personality disorder involves odd beliefs and behaviors but not full-blown psychosis. Given the timeline and the presence of both mood and psychotic symptoms, schizoaffective disorder is the most fitting diagnosis.",9
972,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a tick-borne illness, likely Lyme disease, given his occupation as a forest guide and the presence of a rash. The rash is likely erythema migrans, which is characteristic of early Lyme disease. The standard treatment for early Lyme disease is doxycycline, which is effective against Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium responsible for Lyme disease. Azithromycin is not the first-line treatment for Lyme disease, fluconazole is an antifungal and not relevant here, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is not effective against Borrelia burgdorferi.",9
980,"In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stimulation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors leads to increased mucus secretion, smooth muscle contraction, and bronchoconstriction, which increases airway resistance. To counteract this, a pharmacologic agent that blocks muscarinic receptors would be effective. Ipratropium is an anticholinergic agent that acts as a muscarinic receptor antagonist. By blocking these receptors, ipratropium reduces bronchoconstriction and mucus secretion, thereby decreasing airway resistance. Other options like epinephrine, theophylline, and metoprolol do not directly block muscarinic receptors. Epinephrine is a non-selective adrenergic agonist, theophylline is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and metoprolol is a beta-blocker, none of which directly interfere with muscarinic receptor pathways.",9
981,"The patient is in active labor, as indicated by the cervical dilation from 3 cm to 6 cm over 4 hours. The presence of clear fluid suggests rupture of membranes. The fetal heart rate is reassuring, but the position of the fetal head is inconclusive on pelvic examination. In this scenario, determining the fetal position is crucial to guide further management. Ultrasonography is the most appropriate next step to assess the fetal position and presentation, ensuring that the labor can proceed safely. External cephalic version is not indicated during active labor, and administering misoprostol or oxytocin is not appropriate without confirming fetal position and presentation.",9
950,"This patient fell from a height and presents with multiple injuries, including a swollen and tender right wrist, rib tenderness, and a scalp laceration. The cervical collar indicates a concern for potential cervical spine injury, which is common in falls. The most critical initial concern is to rule out any life-threatening or serious injuries, particularly to the cervical spine, given the mechanism of injury. Although the patient has no midline cervical spine tenderness, he is wearing a cervical collar, suggesting the need for cervical spine evaluation. 

In trauma cases where there is a suspicion of cervical spine injury, a CT scan of the cervical spine is preferred over an X-ray due to its superior sensitivity and ability to detect fractures or dislocations. While the wrist injury and potential rib fractures are relevant, they are less immediately life-threatening than a cervical spine injury. 

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform a CT scan of the cervical spine to rule out any significant injury.",9
983,"The patient presents with a swollen, hot, and tender knee, frequent nosebleeds, and a family history of bleeding disorders. The hematologic panel shows an increased bleeding time and an increased partial thromboplastin time (PTT), which corrects after a mixing study. This suggests a deficiency in a clotting factor rather than the presence of an inhibitor. The normal prothrombin time indicates that the extrinsic pathway is not affected. The increased bleeding time suggests a platelet function issue, but the correction of PTT with mixing points towards a factor deficiency, likely in the intrinsic pathway. Given the family history and the correction with mixing, hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) is likely. The mutation in the carrying protein (factor VIII) explains the abnormal PTT.",9
985,"The patient presents with confusion, slurred speech, headache, muscle pain, and a bruise on his shoulder. He also has a significant weakness in his left arm (1/5 strength). The CT scan shows no abnormalities, ruling out a hemorrhagic stroke. The sudden onset of symptoms and the presence of a bruise suggest a fall, which could be due to a seizure. Seizures can cause postictal confusion and weakness (Todd's paralysis), which aligns with the unilateral weakness observed. The patient's history of alcohol use could also contribute to the risk of seizures. A transient ischemic attack (TIA) could cause similar symptoms but would not typically result in a fall or a bruise. Migraine and syncope are less likely given the presentation and the focal neurological deficit. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of the symptoms is a seizure.",9
989,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a possible ectopic pregnancy, given her positive pregnancy test, right lower abdominal pain, adnexal tenderness, and history of chlamydia, which can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease and increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy. The pooling of blood in the vagina and her last menstrual period being 7 weeks ago further support this suspicion. The most appropriate next step in diagnosis is to confirm the location of the pregnancy. A transvaginal ultrasound is the best choice for early pregnancy evaluation, especially when an ectopic pregnancy is suspected, as it provides better visualization of the adnexa compared to a transabdominal ultrasound.",9
990,"The patient's symptoms and findings are suggestive of dermatomyositis, an inflammatory condition characterized by proximal muscle weakness and skin changes. The skin findings, such as erythema of the upper back, neck, and shoulders, along with the muscle weakness, align with this diagnosis. In dermatomyositis, specific autoantibodies can be present, including anti-Mi-2 antibodies, which are associated with the condition. The other options, such as anti-centromere antibodies, are associated with limited scleroderma (CREST syndrome), anti-La antibodies with Sjögren's syndrome, and anti-Scl-70 antibodies with diffuse scleroderma. Therefore, the antibodies most likely present in this patient are anti-Mi-2 antibodies.",9
996,"The patient's symptoms and history provide important clues. He presents with intense itching and red papules in a linear pattern on his thigh, as well as small rows of bumps on his leg and forearm. The linear pattern of the lesions is particularly suggestive. Cutaneous larva migrans typically presents with serpiginous, linear tracks, but it is more common in areas like the feet and buttocks. Spider bites usually present as single lesions and are not typically linear or in rows. Flea bites often appear as clusters of small, itchy papules, but they are not typically linear. Bed bug bites, however, are known to cause linear patterns of bites, often referred to as ""breakfast, lunch, and dinner"" due to their tendency to bite in a line or cluster. The patient's recent travel to a hotel for a conference also raises suspicion for bed bugs, as they are commonly found in such environments.",9
991,"The patient presents with confusion, blurred vision, weakness, gingival bleeding, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. He has a history of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The key findings include the presence of a monoclonal protein spike on serum protein electrophoresis and no abnormalities on urine electrophoresis or skeletal survey.

The symptoms of confusion and blurred vision can be attributed to hyperviscosity syndrome, which is commonly associated with Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia due to the production of IgM, a large pentameric immunoglobulin that increases blood viscosity. The presence of lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly also supports this diagnosis.

Multiple myeloma typically presents with bone lesions, renal failure, anemia, and hypercalcemia, none of which are present here. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma do not typically present with hyperviscosity syndrome or the specific combination of symptoms seen in this patient.

Therefore, the findings are best explained by Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia.",9
1005,"The scenario describes a 4-year-old boy who has difficulty sorting colored balls, suggesting a potential color vision deficiency. The mother mentions a family history of an ""eye condition,"" which could imply a genetic basis. Color blindness, particularly red-green color blindness, is commonly inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. This is because the genes responsible for red and green color vision are located on the X chromosome. In X-linked recessive inheritance, males (who have only one X chromosome) are more frequently affected because they lack a second X chromosome that could carry a normal copy of the gene. Females, having two X chromosomes, are less likely to be affected unless they inherit two defective copies. Given that the patient is a male and the condition is likely color blindness, the most probable mode of inheritance is X-linked recessive.",9
997,"The patient presents with an indurated, non-tender ulcer on the labia, which is characteristic of a chancre caused by primary syphilis. Syphilis is caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. Treponema pallidum is a spirochete, which is a type of motile and helical-shaped bacterium. The other options describe different pathogens: 
- A 'school of fish' appearance is associated with Haemophilus ducreyi, which causes chancroid, a painful ulcer.
- Gram-negative diplococci are characteristic of Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
- Vaginal epithelial cells covered with bacteria describe clue cells seen in bacterial vaginosis caused by Gardnerella vaginalis.
Given the presentation of a non-tender ulcer, the most likely cause is Treponema pallidum, which is motile and helical-shaped.",9
1000,"The patient presents with nephrotic syndrome, as indicated by significant proteinuria (4+), hypoalbuminemia (1.8 g/dL), hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol 475 mg/dL), and edema. The presence of fatty casts in the urine also supports nephrotic syndrome. Additionally, the patient has a history of smoking and a chest CT showing a right upper lobe mass, which raises suspicion for lung cancer, particularly a type associated with paraneoplastic syndromes.

Membranous nephropathy is known to be associated with malignancies, especially solid tumors like lung cancer. The combination of nephrotic syndrome and a lung mass in this patient suggests a paraneoplastic membranous nephropathy.

Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is less commonly associated with malignancies and typically presents with nephrotic syndrome but is not classically linked to lung cancer.

Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) would present with hematuria and rapidly declining renal function, which is not the case here.

Thin basement membrane disease is a benign condition causing hematuria, not nephrotic syndrome.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is membranous nephropathy associated with the lung mass.",9
1006,"The patient has a history of prostatic adenocarcinoma and presents with a blastic and sclerotic lesion in the L5 vertebral body, which is suggestive of metastatic prostate cancer to the bone. Prostate cancer typically causes osteoblastic (sclerotic) bone lesions. These lesions are associated with increased bone formation, which leads to an increase in alkaline phosphatase levels due to increased osteoblastic activity. However, calcium and phosphate levels usually remain normal in osteoblastic metastases because the balance of bone formation and resorption does not significantly alter serum calcium or phosphate levels. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels are also typically normal unless there is a separate parathyroid disorder. Therefore, the most likely serum study findings in this patient would be normal calcium, normal phosphate, increased alkaline phosphatase, and normal parathyroid hormone.",9
1008,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest hemochromatosis, a condition characterized by excessive iron deposition in the body. Key features include joint pain, diabetes (""bronze diabetes""), skin hyperpigmentation (""bronze"" skin), and possible liver involvement. Hemochromatosis increases the risk of liver cirrhosis, which can lead to hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient's joint pain, diabetes, and skin changes align with this diagnosis, making hepatocellular carcinoma the most likely disease he is predisposed to.",9
1010,"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a pleural effusion. The tracheal deviation to the left indicates a shift of mediastinal structures, which can occur with a large pleural effusion on the right side. The decreased resonance on percussion and absence of breath sounds over the right hemithorax are consistent with fluid accumulation in the pleural space. Pneumonia typically presents with fever, cough, and localized crackles or bronchial breath sounds rather than tracheal deviation. Atelectasis usually causes tracheal deviation towards the affected side, not away. Pneumothorax would cause hyperresonance on percussion, not decreased resonance. Given the patient's history of renal cell carcinoma, a malignant pleural effusion is a plausible cause.",9
1009,"The patient has chronic bronchitis and presents with symptoms suggestive of pulmonary hypertension, as indicated by the elevated pulmonary artery pressure and the echocardiographic findings of right ventricular hypertrophy. The significant drop in pulmonary artery pressure after inhaled nitric oxide suggests that the pulmonary hypertension is responsive to vasodilators. In such cases, calcium channel blockers like diltiazem can be used to manage pulmonary hypertension if the patient shows vasoreactivity. Hydralazine and isosorbide mononitrate are not typically used for pulmonary hypertension, and losartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker used for systemic hypertension, not pulmonary hypertension.",9
1012,"The patient's presentation is consistent with adhesive capsulitis, also known as frozen shoulder, which is characterized by progressive stiffness and limited range of motion in the shoulder. This condition often follows a period of pain and is common in individuals with diabetes. The key features here are the gradual onset of stiffness, the previous pain that has subsided, and the limitation in both active and passive range of motion. The atrophy of shoulder muscles is likely due to disuse. 

The management of adhesive capsulitis typically involves non-surgical interventions initially. Physical therapy is the mainstay of treatment to improve range of motion and function. NSAIDs may help with pain but are not indicated here as the pain has subsided. Corticosteroid injections can be used to reduce inflammation and pain but are more beneficial in the earlier painful stage. Arthroscopic capsular release is considered when conservative measures fail.

Given the current stage of the condition, the next best step is to initiate physical therapy to improve shoulder mobility.",9
1016,"The patient is a 75-year-old man who experienced a brief loss of consciousness (syncope) while playing with his granddaughter. He has a history of mild chest pain and abdominal discomfort, particularly during exertion, which suggests angina or exertional symptoms. His blood pressure is relatively low, and he has a late systolic murmur at the right sternal border radiating to the carotids, which is characteristic of aortic stenosis. Aortic stenosis in older adults is commonly due to calcification of the aortic valve. The syncope, exertional symptoms, and characteristic murmur all point towards aortic stenosis as the underlying cause, which is due to calcification of the aortic valve.",9
1020,"The patient's symptoms of eye irritation and a gritty sensation, along with frequent dental caries, suggest dryness of the eyes and mouth. These symptoms are characteristic of Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the exocrine glands, leading to dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca) and dry mouth (xerostomia). Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can have a wide range of symptoms, but dry eyes and mouth are more specifically associated with Sjögren's syndrome. Rheumatoid arthritis can be associated with Sjögren's syndrome, but the primary symptoms here align more directly with Sjögren's. Fibromyalgia is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain and does not typically cause dry eyes or mouth. Therefore, the most likely cause of her symptoms is Sjögren's syndrome.",9
1022,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of biliary colic, including right upper quadrant pain radiating to the shoulder, fever, and leukocytosis. The ultrasound, however, shows normal findings, which can occur in cases of acalculous cholecystitis or when gallstones are not visualized. The elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest an inflammatory process. Cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan) is useful in diagnosing acute cholecystitis, especially when ultrasound findings are inconclusive. It assesses the function of the gallbladder and can identify cystic duct obstruction. Therefore, the best next step is to perform a cholescintigraphy to confirm the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.",9
1024,"The patient's symptoms of dysuria and increased urinary frequency, along with suprapubic tenderness, suggest a urinary tract infection (UTI). The urinalysis shows positive leukocyte esterase, indicating the presence of white blood cells, which is consistent with a UTI. The negative nitrite test suggests that the organism is not a nitrite-producing bacteria, which rules out common nitrite-positive organisms like E. coli. The urine culture shows resistance to novobiocin, which is a key characteristic of Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Staphylococcus saprophyticus is a common cause of UTIs in young sexually active women and is known for being novobiocin-resistant, unlike Staphylococcus epidermidis, which is novobiocin-sensitive. The other organisms listed do not match the novobiocin resistance pattern.",9
1025,"The infant presents with hyperammonemia, low citrulline levels, and elevated orotic acid. These findings suggest a urea cycle disorder, specifically ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency. OTC deficiency is an X-linked disorder that leads to an accumulation of carbamoyl phosphate, which is then converted to orotic acid, explaining the elevated orotic acid levels. The treatment for hyperammonemia in urea cycle disorders often includes agents that help remove excess nitrogen, such as sodium benzoate, which conjugates with glycine to form hippurate, excreted in urine. This helps reduce ammonia levels. Therefore, benzoate administration would be beneficial in this case.",9
1014,"The patient presents with an itchy rash that developed 2 days ago, following the initiation of captopril for hypertension 3 weeks ago. Captopril is an ACE inhibitor, which can lead to increased levels of bradykinin due to impaired degradation. Elevated bradykinin levels can cause angioedema and urticarial rashes. The description of the rash as itchy, nontender, and blanching suggests urticaria, which is consistent with cutaneous mast cell activation due to increased bradykinin. While impaired bradykinin degradation is the underlying cause, the direct mechanism of the rash is related to mast cell activation. Therefore, the most direct explanation for the skin findings is cutaneous mast cell activation.",9
1023,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings are suggestive of a hematologic malignancy. The child has generalized fatigue, easy bruising, fever, severe leg pain, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. The bone marrow aspirate shows immature cells that stain positive for CD10, CD19, and TdT. These markers are characteristic of precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). CD10 and CD19 are markers for B-cell lineage, and TdT is a marker for lymphoid precursors. The high leukocyte count with predominance of immature cells (blasts) further supports the diagnosis of ALL. Hodgkin lymphoma typically presents with painless lymphadenopathy and does not usually involve bone marrow with such markers. Hairy cell leukemia is rare in children and presents with different markers. Aplastic anemia would show pancytopenia without immature cells. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",9
1027,"The clinical presentation and positive interferon-γ release assay suggest tuberculosis (TB) infection. The chest x-ray shows bilateral mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which is consistent with TB. The biopsy likely shows a granuloma, a common finding in TB. Granulomas are primarily composed of macrophages that have transformed into epithelioid cells and multinucleated giant cells. These macrophages are the key cells in forming the granulomatous structure in TB.",9
1015,"The patient presents with back pain that intensified after a fall, but he has no neurological deficits or red flags for serious underlying conditions such as cancer, infection, or fracture. His physical exam shows diffuse tenderness without point tenderness or step-offs, which decreases the likelihood of a fracture. The pain is somewhat relieved by Tylenol, suggesting a musculoskeletal cause. In the absence of red flags, the initial management of acute low back pain typically involves conservative measures such as NSAIDs or acetaminophen and physical activity. Imaging is not immediately necessary unless there are signs of serious underlying conditions or if the pain persists beyond 4-6 weeks. Therefore, the next best step is to continue conservative management with exercise therapy and NSAIDs/acetaminophen.",9
1030,"The patient's presentation of firm, mobile, and nontender nodules on the hands, along with a family history of early myocardial infarction, suggests the presence of xanthomas. Xanthomas are deposits of lipid-laden macrophages in the skin and are associated with hyperlipidemia. The mechanism underlying xanthomas is the extravasation of lipoproteins into the skin, where they are taken up by macrophages, leading to the formation of these nodules. The family history of early myocardial infarction supports a possible genetic lipid disorder, such as familial hypercholesterolemia, which can lead to elevated lipoprotein levels and xanthoma formation.",9
1029,"The question describes an antibiotic that mimics the structure of aminoacyl-tRNA and is incorporated into the growing peptide chain, leading to early termination of protein synthesis. This process involves the peptidyl transferase activity, which is responsible for forming peptide bonds between amino acids during translation. The peptidyl transferase activity is located in the large ribosomal subunit, specifically at the P site, where the growing polypeptide chain is held. The antibiotic is described as being covalently bonded to the growing peptide chain, which occurs at the P site. Therefore, the most likely site where this process occurs is the P site.",9
1037,"The patient presents with hirsutism, which is excessive hair growth in a male pattern distribution, and has a BMI indicating obesity. Her hormone levels are within the reference range, and she is not pregnant. The most common cause of hirsutism in women is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is often associated with obesity and insulin resistance. Oral contraceptives are commonly used to manage hirsutism in PCOS by suppressing ovarian androgen production and increasing sex hormone-binding globulin, which decreases free testosterone levels. Prednisone is a glucocorticoid and not typically used for hirsutism. Leuprolide is a GnRH analog used for conditions like endometriosis or prostate cancer, not hirsutism. Ketoconazole is an antifungal that can inhibit steroid synthesis but is not a first-line treatment for hirsutism. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is an oral contraceptive.",9
1033,"The patient's presentation includes agitation, bizarre behavior, hypertension, tachycardia, nasal mucosa bleeding, and small pupils. These symptoms are consistent with stimulant intoxication. Cocaine is a stimulant that can cause hypertension, tachycardia, agitation, and nasal mucosa damage due to snorting. The small pupils (miosis) are less typical for cocaine, but the other symptoms strongly suggest cocaine use. PCP intoxication usually causes nystagmus and dissociative symptoms, which are not described here. THC intoxication typically causes euphoria and relaxation, not agitation and hypertension. Thyrotoxicosis can cause tachycardia and agitation but not nasal bleeding or the specific behavioral symptoms seen here. Therefore, cocaine intoxication is the most likely cause.",9
1040,"The patient is being started on a diuretic that has a side effect of breast enlargement, which is gynecomastia. Spironolactone is a diuretic known for causing gynecomastia due to its anti-androgen effects. Spironolactone works by antagonizing aldosterone receptors in the collecting duct of the nephron, leading to decreased sodium reabsorption and increased potassium retention. Therefore, the most immediate physiologic effect of spironolactone is decreased sodium reabsorption in the collecting duct.",9
1039,"The patient is exhibiting signs of a serious mental disorder, likely a psychotic disorder, given his delusions and flat affect. He has expressed a specific threat to harm his neighbor, which indicates a duty to protect the potential victim. In such cases, the healthcare provider has a duty to warn the person at risk and inform law enforcement to prevent harm. This is consistent with the Tarasoff ruling, which mandates that mental health professionals have a duty to protect individuals who are being threatened with bodily harm by a patient.",9
1042,"The cough reflex involves sensory and motor components. The sensory component of the cough reflex is mediated by the internal laryngeal nerve, a branch of the superior laryngeal nerve, which provides sensation to the mucosa of the larynx above the vocal cords, including the piriform recess. If the fishbone was lodged in the right piriform recess, it could have damaged the internal laryngeal nerve, impairing the sensory input necessary to trigger the cough reflex. The recurrent laryngeal nerve and inferior laryngeal nerve are primarily involved in motor innervation to the intrinsic muscles of the larynx, and the superior laryngeal nerve also has a motor component to the cricothyroid muscle, but the sensory loss affecting the cough reflex is due to the internal laryngeal nerve.",9
1043,"The clinical presentation suggests a hematological disorder, particularly one involving the spleen and bone marrow. The symptoms of splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis with lymphocytic predominance, along with the inconclusive bone marrow aspiration, point towards a condition like hairy cell leukemia. Hairy cell leukemia is characterized by the presence of hairy cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. The laboratory finding most reliably associated with hairy cell leukemia is the presence of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) positivity. Therefore, the correct answer is TRAP.",9
1038,"The patient was involved in a fire and presents with symptoms that could be consistent with smoke inhalation. The key laboratory findings include a metabolic acidosis (pH 7.30, HCO3- 18 mEq/L) with a normal PCO2, indicating a primary metabolic acidosis. The COHb level is 2%, which is not elevated, ruling out significant carbon monoxide poisoning. The symptoms and the context of a fire suggest possible cyanide poisoning, which can occur due to combustion of materials like plastics and synthetic fibers. Cyanide poisoning can cause metabolic acidosis due to inhibition of cellular respiration. The appropriate treatment for suspected cyanide poisoning is administration of a cyanide antidote, such as intravenous hydroxycobalamin.",9
1047,"The patient presents with symptoms and history suggestive of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), likely chronic bronchitis given her smoking history and chronic cough with sputum production. The arterial blood gas shows respiratory acidosis with partial metabolic compensation, indicated by the elevated PCO2 and decreased pH. In COPD, especially during an exacerbation, the kidneys compensate for respiratory acidosis by increasing bicarbonate reabsorption, which would lead to decreased urinary bicarbonate excretion. This compensation helps to normalize the blood pH over time.",9
1051,"The study initially analyzed 900 patients, but 400 were not included in the analysis. Including these additional participants would increase the sample size, which generally leads to more precise estimates of the effect size. This increased precision typically results in narrower confidence intervals, not wider ones, so option B is incorrect. A larger sample size also increases the power of the study, which is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is truly false. Therefore, option C is correct. The significance level (alpha) is a predetermined threshold and is not affected by sample size, so option A is incorrect. External validity refers to the generalizability of the study results to other populations, which is not directly affected by increasing the sample size within the same study population, so option D is incorrect.",9
1044,"The patient presents with epigastric pain and hematemesis (vomiting blood), following excessive alcohol consumption and NSAID use. The history of alcohol abuse and the pattern of vomiting suggest a possible tear due to forceful vomiting. A transmural tear of the lower esophagus (Boerhaave syndrome) would typically present with severe chest pain and subcutaneous emphysema, which are not described here. Inflammation of the esophageal wall (esophagitis) could cause bleeding but is less likely to present with sudden hematemesis after vomiting. A neoplastic growth would likely present with more chronic symptoms and not acute hematemesis. A mucosal tear at the gastroesophageal junction (Mallory-Weiss tear) is commonly associated with forceful vomiting and alcohol use, leading to hematemesis. This fits the clinical picture of this patient.",9
1053,"The patient presents with symptoms and imaging findings suggestive of a pulmonary infection and a brain lesion. The bronchoalveolar lavage reveals weakly acid-fast, gram-positive bacteria with branching, filamentous shapes, which are characteristic of Nocardia species. Nocardia infections are more common in immunocompromised patients, such as those on immunosuppressive therapy following organ transplantation. The presence of a lung mass with consolidation and a brain lesion with ring enhancement further supports the diagnosis of disseminated nocardiosis. The most appropriate initial treatment for Nocardia infections is trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.",9
1057,"The flow of blood through a vessel is governed by Poiseuille's law, which states that flow (Q) is proportional to the fourth power of the radius (r) of the vessel: Q ∝ r^4. In the case of a 50% stenosis, the radius of the artery is reduced by half. If the original radius is r, the new radius after 50% stenosis is 0.5r. 

The flow through the stenosed artery is proportional to (0.5r)^4 = 0.5^4 * r^4 = 0.0625 * r^4. 

Thus, the flow is reduced by a factor of 0.0625 compared to the original flow, which means the flow is decreased by a factor of 16 (since 1/0.0625 = 16).",10
1058,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of pregnancy, including nausea, malaise, weight gain, breast engorgement, and nipple hyperpigmentation. Her last menstruation was 6 weeks ago, and she has a positive urine beta-hCG test, which strongly indicates pregnancy. The chickenpox (varicella) vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine and is contraindicated during pregnancy due to potential risks to the fetus. Therefore, the proper recommendation is to confirm the pregnancy with a serum beta-hCG test and, if positive, postpone the administration of the vaccine until after the pregnancy is completed.",9
1063,"The Candida skin test is a type of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction, which is used to assess cell-mediated immunity. This reaction is primarily mediated by T-cells, specifically CD4+ T-helper 1 (Th1) cells. When the antigen is injected, these T-cells recognize the antigen and release cytokines that recruit other immune cells to the site, leading to induration and inflammation. The absence of induration in this patient suggests a deficiency in cell-mediated immunity, possibly due to a lack of functional T-cells. Basophils and mast cells are more involved in immediate hypersensitivity reactions, while fibroblasts are involved in tissue repair and not directly in immune responses.",9
1062,"The patient presents with atrial fibrillation, as indicated by the irregularly irregular rhythm and absence of P waves on ECG. In atrial fibrillation, there is an increased risk of thromboembolism, so anticoagulation is often prescribed. Idarucizumab is a reversal agent for dabigatran, which is a direct thrombin inhibitor. Therefore, the prophylactic medication prescribed to this patient is dabigatran, and its beneficial effect is due to the direct inhibition of thrombin.",9
1060,"The patient presents with bilateral lower leg edema, dyspnea on exertion, and a history of myocardial infarction. These symptoms suggest possible heart failure, likely due to left ventricular dysfunction. The presence of an S3 gallop and a soft systolic murmur further supports this suspicion. The edema is worse in the evening and improves with rest, which is typical of cardiac-related edema. Given the history of STEMI and the current symptoms, the most appropriate test to assess cardiac function and evaluate for heart failure is an echocardiogram. This test will provide information on the ejection fraction and any structural abnormalities of the heart that could explain the patient's symptoms.",9
1068,"The patient is experiencing fatigue and worsening shortness of breath on exertion, and she has been taking diethylpropion, an appetite suppressant. Diethylpropion is known to be associated with pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to right heart strain. The loud pulmonary component of the S2 suggests elevated pressure in the pulmonary artery, consistent with pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is often caused by hyperplasia of the pulmonary vascular walls, leading to increased resistance and pressure in the pulmonary circulation. This matches the symptoms and findings in this patient.",9
1079,"The patient's symptoms and physical findings are suggestive of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). She has irregular menses, hirsutism (increased body hair), acne, and obesity. The darkening of the skin in the axilla and neck (acanthosis nigricans) is often associated with insulin resistance. PCOS is commonly associated with insulin resistance, which can lead to hyperinsulinemia and contribute to the symptoms of PCOS. The other options are less likely to be associated with the described clinical picture. Aldosterone hyperproduction would typically cause hypertension and hypokalemia, adrenaline hypersecretion would cause symptoms like palpitations and hypertension, and hypoestrogenism would not typically cause hirsutism or acne.",9
1076,"The patient's symptoms include difficulty walking, dizziness, fatigue, heartburn, diarrhea, foul-smelling stools, and weight loss. These symptoms, along with the presence of ulcers in the gastric antrum and descending duodenum, suggest a malabsorption syndrome. The decreased levels of vitamin E and D indicate fat malabsorption. The wide-based gait and impaired rapid alternating movements suggest neurological involvement, possibly due to vitamin deficiencies.

The presence of ulcers in both the stomach and duodenum is characteristic of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, which is caused by gastrin-secreting tumors (gastrinomas) leading to excessive gastric acid production. This excessive acid can inactivate pancreatic enzymes, leading to malabsorption and the symptoms described.

Option A, inactivation of pancreatic enzymes, is consistent with the findings of ulcers and malabsorption due to excessive gastric acid production in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.",9
1081,"The patient's presentation is consistent with vitiligo, characterized by depigmented patches on the skin. Vitiligo is caused by the autoimmune destruction of melanocytes, the cells responsible for producing melanin, which gives skin its color. The gradual increase in size and lack of symptoms like itchiness or pain further support this diagnosis. The other options are less likely: absence of tyrosinase activity is related to albinism, Mycobacterium leprae infection causes leprosy with sensory loss, and Malassezia globosa is associated with tinea versicolor, which typically presents with scaling.",9
1085,"The patient has a chronic ulcer on his left great toe with exposed bone, indicating osteomyelitis. The bone biopsy shows abundant gram-negative rods that do not ferment lactose, which is characteristic of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pseudomonas is a common cause of infections in diabetic foot ulcers, especially when there is exposed bone. It is also known for causing otitis externa, particularly the severe form known as ""malignant otitis externa,"" which is often seen in diabetic patients. Gastroenteritis is more commonly associated with other bacteria like Salmonella or E. coli, Waterhouse-Friedrichsen syndrome is associated with Neisseria meningitidis, and rheumatic fever is associated with Streptococcus pyogenes. Therefore, the condition strongly associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa is otitis externa.",9
1087,"The patient presents with confusion, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, and vomiting after eating, along with a history of sleeve gastrectomy. Her laboratory values show hypoglycemia (glucose of 41 mg/dL) with a normal C-peptide level, which suggests that the hypoglycemia is not due to endogenous insulin production (as would be seen in insulinoma or sulfonylurea use). The normal C-peptide level indicates that exogenous insulin is likely not the cause, ruling out insulin overdose. Dumping syndrome is a common complication after gastric surgery, characterized by rapid gastric emptying leading to symptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhea, and hypoglycemia after meals. Malnutrition is unlikely to cause acute hypoglycemia and confusion in this context. Propranolol overdose could cause hypoglycemia, but it would also likely cause bradycardia, not tachycardia as seen in this patient. Therefore, the symptoms and lab findings are most consistent with dumping syndrome.",9
1088,"The patient presents with symptoms and ECG findings indicative of an inferior wall myocardial infarction (MI), as evidenced by ST segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. The ECG also shows P waves independent of QRS complexes, suggesting a complete heart block, which is a common complication of inferior MIs. Inferior MIs are most commonly caused by occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA), especially when the RCA supplies the inferior wall of the left ventricle. The presence of jugular venous distention and crackles in the lung fields suggests right heart failure and pulmonary congestion, which can occur due to right ventricular involvement or left-sided heart failure. Given these findings, coronary angiography is most likely to show narrowing of the proximal right coronary artery.",9
1089,"The patient is being treated for cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, which is commonly treated with ganciclovir or valganciclovir. A known side effect of ganciclovir is bone marrow suppression, which can lead to neutropenia. Zidovudine, an antiretroviral medication used in the treatment of HIV, also has bone marrow suppression as a side effect, particularly causing neutropenia and anemia. When ganciclovir is coadministered with zidovudine, the risk of neutropenia is increased due to the additive effects on bone marrow suppression. Foscarnet, efavirenz, and raltegravir do not have the same degree of bone marrow suppression as zidovudine. Therefore, the coadministration of zidovudine with ganciclovir is most likely to precipitate a deficiency of neutrophils in this patient.",9
1091,"The presentation of the rash in this 3-month-old boy is characterized by erythematous patches with greasy yellow scales on the scalp and forehead. This description is classic for seborrheic dermatitis, commonly known as ""cradle cap"" in infants. It typically affects areas with a high density of sebaceous glands, such as the scalp, face, and sometimes the diaper area. The presence of greasy scales and the location of the rash are key features that distinguish seborrheic dermatitis from other conditions. Atopic dermatitis usually presents with dry, itchy skin and is more common in flexural areas. Seborrheic keratosis is a benign skin growth that is not typically seen in infants. Allergic contact dermatitis would be less likely in this age group and would typically present with a more acute reaction to a specific allergen.",9
1103,"The patient presents with nephrotic syndrome, as indicated by significant proteinuria (4.0 g/day), edema, and hypertension. The kidney biopsy shows thickening of the glomerular basement membrane and dense subepithelial deposits on electron microscopy, which are characteristic of membranous nephropathy. Membranous nephropathy is often associated with the presence of anti-phospholipase A2 receptor antibodies, which are found in many cases of primary membranous nephropathy. The other antibodies listed are associated with different conditions: anti-myeloperoxidase antibodies with microscopic polyangiitis, anti-streptolysin O antibodies with post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, and anti-collagen type IV antibodies with Goodpasture syndrome. Therefore, the most likely finding in further evaluation is anti-phospholipase A2 receptor antibodies.",9
1097,"The patient is a 36-year-old woman who smokes one pack of cigarettes daily. Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCs) are contraindicated in women over 35 who smoke due to an increased risk of cardiovascular events, such as thromboembolism and stroke. The diaphragm with spermicide is not contraindicated, although she is allergic to latex, so a non-latex diaphragm would be needed. The progestin-only pill is safe for smokers. The intrauterine device (IUD) is contraindicated if it is a copper IUD due to her copper allergy, but a hormonal IUD could be considered. However, the question asks for the method that is contraindicated, and the most clear contraindication due to her smoking is the combined oral contraceptive pill.",9
1105,"The patient is presenting with signs of respiratory distress and hypoxemia, as indicated by the oxygen saturation of 90%. He also has a narrow-complex tachycardia with irregular P waves and PR intervals, suggesting atrial fibrillation, which can be exacerbated by hypoxia. The immediate priority in managing a patient with respiratory distress and hypoxemia is to ensure adequate oxygenation. Therefore, administering oxygen is the best initial step to improve his oxygen saturation and potentially stabilize his condition. Other interventions, such as addressing the arrhythmia or further diagnostic tests, can be considered after ensuring adequate oxygenation.",9
1107,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, HNPCC), given her family history of colorectal, endometrial, and ovarian cancers. Lynch syndrome is associated with defects in the mismatch repair (MMR) system, which leads to microsatellite instability and an increased risk of certain types of cancer, including colorectal cancer. The presence of a fungating hemorrhagic mass in the ascending colon and the family history of related cancers strongly point towards this genetic condition. Therefore, the impaired process in this patient is mismatch repair.",9
1116,"The physician's publication describes a detailed account of a single patient's unique reaction to a new sunscreen, including symptoms, treatment, and follow-up. This type of publication, focusing on a single patient, is known as a case report. A case series would involve multiple patients with similar presentations. A case scenario is typically a hypothetical situation used for educational purposes, and a case definition is a set of standard criteria for classifying whether a person has a particular disease or condition.",9
1114,"Atorvastatin is a statin that works by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, which decreases hepatic cholesterol synthesis. This reduction in cholesterol synthesis leads to an upregulation of LDL receptors on hepatocytes to increase the clearance of LDL from the bloodstream. Cholestyramine is a bile acid sequestrant that binds bile acids in the intestine, preventing their reabsorption. This also leads to increased conversion of cholesterol to bile acids in the liver, which further decreases hepatic cholesterol levels and upregulates LDL receptor expression to clear more LDL from the blood. Both atorvastatin and cholestyramine ultimately result in increased LDL receptor expression on hepatocytes.",9
1117,"The newborn presents with jaundice that started on the face and spread to the trunk, which is common in neonatal jaundice. The total bilirubin level is 7 mg/dL with a direct bilirubin of 0.6 mg/dL, indicating predominantly unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The reticulocyte count is low at 0.3%, suggesting no significant hemolysis. The mother is blood group A, Rh-negative, and the baby is O, Rh-positive, but there is no evidence of hemolytic disease of the newborn (e.g., elevated reticulocyte count or anemia). The baby is 5 days old, and physiological jaundice typically peaks around 3-5 days of life. The thyroid function test (free T4) is normal, ruling out congenital hypothyroidism. Dubin-Johnson syndrome and biliary atresia would present with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, not unconjugated. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is physiological neonatal jaundice.",9
1118,"The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus and her hemoglobin A1c is 9.8%, indicating poor glycemic control. She has gained weight and reports non-compliance with her metformin regimen. The primary issue here is non-compliance with medication, which is contributing to her poor glycemic control. Adding another medication like glyburide (a sulfonylurea) could potentially improve her blood glucose levels, but it does not address the underlying issue of non-compliance. Referring her to a dietician or an endocrinologist might help with education and management, but the immediate step should focus on improving compliance and monitoring. Scheduling more frequent follow-up visits can help ensure she is taking her medication as prescribed and provide opportunities to address barriers to compliance.",9
1094,"The patient's symptoms are suggestive of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), characterized by an urge to move the legs, often accompanied by uncomfortable sensations, which are relieved by movement. The symptoms are worse at rest and during the evening or night. The patient's pale sclerae suggest anemia, which can be associated with RLS, particularly iron deficiency anemia. The key to identifying the underlying etiology is to investigate for iron deficiency, often done by checking ferritin levels. However, since the question asks for a diagnostic step rather than a lab test, the best choice among the given options is to perform a colonoscopy. This is because the patient has had significant unintentional weight loss and anemia, which could suggest gastrointestinal bleeding or malignancy as a source of iron deficiency, potentially leading to RLS. A colonoscopy can help identify such sources.",9
1120,"The patient's symptoms include inappropriate behavior, disinhibition, changes in eating habits, apathy, and a blunt affect. These are characteristic of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), particularly the behavioral variant. The Mini-Mental State Examination score is relatively high, which is consistent with FTD, as memory and orientation can be preserved in the early stages. The lack of motor symptoms makes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis unlikely. Normal pressure hydrocephalus typically presents with a triad of gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and cognitive dysfunction, which are not present here. Wilson disease would present with liver dysfunction and neurological symptoms, but the patient's normal lab results and lack of liver-related symptoms make this unlikely. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is frontotemporal dementia.",9
1121,"The patient's symptoms and MRI findings are suggestive of bilateral vestibular schwannomas (acoustic neuromas), which are characteristic of Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2). NF2 is associated with the development of multiple tumors, including vestibular schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas. Given the presence of bilateral cerebellopontine angle tumors, meningiomas are a common associated tumor in NF2. Therefore, this patient is most likely to develop meningiomas in the future.",9
1126,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of pharyngitis, including sore throat, anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and tonsillar swelling. The absence of cough, nasal congestion, or rhinorrhea makes a viral etiology less likely and suggests a possible bacterial cause, such as Group A Streptococcus (GAS). The Centor criteria can be used to assess the likelihood of streptococcal pharyngitis, which includes fever, absence of cough, tonsillar exudates, and tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy. Although the patient does not have tonsillar exudates, she has other signs that could suggest streptococcal pharyngitis. The next best step is to confirm the diagnosis with a rapid strep test before initiating treatment, as unnecessary antibiotic use should be avoided.",9
1132,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest hemolytic anemia. The patient has scleral icterus, elevated indirect bilirubin, low haptoglobin, and a high reticulocyte count, all indicative of hemolysis. The history of hand and foot swelling (dactylitis) and the patient's origin from Sudan suggest sickle cell disease, a common hemolytic anemia in individuals of African descent. In sickle cell disease, the spleen is often enlarged due to sequestration of sickled red blood cells, especially in young children before autosplenectomy occurs. Therefore, splenomegaly is a likely finding on further evaluation.",9
1129,"In patients undergoing chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia, there is a risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), which can lead to acute renal failure. TLS occurs when cancer cells release their contents into the bloodstream, leading to hyperuricemia due to the breakdown of nucleic acids into uric acid. To prevent acute renal failure, it is important to manage hyperuricemia. Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that decreases the production of uric acid, thereby reducing the risk of uric acid nephropathy and acute renal failure. Sulfinpyrazone and probenecid are uricosuric agents that increase the excretion of uric acid but are not typically used in the acute setting of TLS. Colchicine is used for gout but does not address hyperuricemia or prevent renal failure in TLS.",9
1136,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible duodenal ulcer. Duodenal ulcers are often associated with pain that occurs when the stomach is empty and is relieved by eating food. This is because food can temporarily buffer stomach acid, providing relief. The fact that the patient experiences relief from symptoms after eating a small meal or snack aligns with this characteristic of duodenal ulcers. Omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, also provides relief by reducing stomach acid production, which is consistent with ulcer treatment but not specific to duodenal ulcers alone. Non-bilious vomiting and early satiety are less specific to duodenal ulcers. Therefore, the most consistent feature with a duodenal ulcer in this scenario is the relief of symptoms with food ingestion.",9
1134,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest Huntington's disease. The key features include depression, personality changes, and chorea (jerky movements). The family history is unknown, but the father's death in his 50s could be consistent with Huntington's, which is an autosomal dominant disorder. The flat affect and grimacing also align with this diagnosis. In Huntington's disease, imaging typically shows atrophy of the caudate nucleus, which is part of the dorsal striatum. Therefore, on further workup, dorsal striatum atrophy on head CT is most likely to be seen.",9
1137,"The patient's symptoms and findings are suggestive of infective endocarditis, particularly affecting the tricuspid valve, which is common in intravenous drug users. The presence of Staphylococcus aureus in blood cultures and the tricuspid valve involvement strongly point towards this. The conjunctival hemorrhages, bruises, and lesions on the foot are consistent with embolic phenomena often seen in endocarditis. The holosystolic murmur at the left sternal edge further supports the diagnosis of tricuspid valve involvement. Intravenous drug use is a well-known risk factor for right-sided endocarditis due to the introduction of pathogens directly into the bloodstream, often leading to tricuspid valve infection. Therefore, a detailed history would most likely reveal chronic intravenous drug usage.",9
1147,"The patient presents with symptoms and findings consistent with internal hemorrhoids, specifically prolapsing internal hemorrhoids that spontaneously reduce. The presence of bright red blood in the stool, absence of pain, and the finding of enlarged bluish veins above the dentate line on anoscopy support this diagnosis. The prolapse that reduces spontaneously indicates a Grade II internal hemorrhoid. Initial management of Grade II internal hemorrhoids typically involves conservative measures such as dietary modifications, increased fiber intake, and stool softeners to reduce straining during defecation. Docusate is a stool softener that can help achieve this by making stools easier to pass and reducing straining. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to initiate docusate therapy.",9
1146,"The patient presents with a history of prolactinoma, recurrent peptic ulcers, hypercalcemia, and kidney stones. These findings suggest multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1), which is characterized by the triad of pituitary tumors (such as prolactinoma), pancreatic endocrine tumors (which can cause peptic ulcers due to gastrinomas), and hyperparathyroidism (leading to hypercalcemia and kidney stones). MEN 1 is caused by mutations in the MEN1 gene, which encodes the protein menin. Therefore, the protein abnormality in this patient is related to altered menin protein.",9
1140,"The newborn is premature, born at 31 weeks' gestation, and has a low birth weight of 1100 g. The antenatal period was complicated by chorioamnionitis, which can increase the risk of complications in premature infants. The symptoms include a tonic seizure, lethargy, irregular respirations, hypotension, a tense anterior fontanelle, sluggish pupillary response, and decreased muscle tone. These symptoms are indicative of neurological compromise.

Premature infants, especially those born before 32 weeks, are at high risk for intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) due to the fragility of the germinal matrix and immature cerebral vasculature. The tense fontanelle and neurological symptoms such as seizures and lethargy are consistent with increased intracranial pressure and brain injury, which can occur with IVH.

Galactosemia typically presents with feeding difficulties, jaundice, and liver dysfunction, not with acute neurological symptoms in the immediate neonatal period. Spinal muscular atrophy presents with progressive muscle weakness but not with acute seizures or tense fontanelle. Congenital hydrocephalus could cause a tense fontanelle but is less likely to present acutely with seizures and lethargy in a premature infant without prior signs.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis given the clinical presentation and risk factors is intraventricular hemorrhage.",9
1148,"The patient presents with symptoms and radiographic findings suggestive of a bacterial pneumonia complicated by a pleural effusion. In the context of pneumonia, the pleural effusion is likely to be an exudative effusion. Exudative effusions are characterized by high protein content due to increased vascular permeability caused by inflammation. This is in contrast to transudative effusions, which are typically clear and have low protein content. Malignant cells would be expected in effusions caused by cancer, which is not indicated here. Hypocellular fluid is more characteristic of transudative effusions. Therefore, in this case of suspected bacterial pneumonia with pleural effusion, the effusion fluid is expected to be protein-rich.",9
1149,"The patient's symptoms include burning pain in the neck and arms, paresthesias in the hands, weakness in both hands, decreased muscle strength, absent reflexes, fasciculations, and a dissociated sensory loss (loss of pain and temperature sensation but preserved vibration and proprioception) in the upper extremities. These findings suggest a central cord syndrome, which is characteristic of syringomyelia. Syringomyelia involves the formation of a fluid-filled cavity or syrinx within the spinal cord, typically affecting the cervical region. This condition can cause damage to the crossing fibers of the spinothalamic tract, leading to a ""cape-like"" distribution of sensory loss, and can also affect the anterior horn cells, leading to muscle weakness and atrophy in the hands. The history of a motor vehicle collision could suggest a post-traumatic syrinx formation. The other options do not fit the clinical picture as well: Tabes dorsalis would present with sensory ataxia and loss of proprioception, cervical disk prolapse would cause radicular pain and possibly myelopathy but not the dissociated sensory loss, and multiple sclerosis would have more varied neurological deficits and typically involves the CNS more diffusely.",9
1150,"The patient has bipolar disorder and is likely taking lithium, which is known to cause hypothyroidism and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Lithium use during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of cardiac anomalies, particularly Ebstein's anomaly, which involves atrialization of the right ventricle. This is due to the displacement of the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle, leading to a malformed heart structure. The other options listed are not typically associated with lithium use. Aplasia cutis is associated with methimazole, neural tube defects with folate deficiency or certain antiepileptic drugs, and hypoplastic or absent limbs with thalidomide.",9
1152,"When a tooth is avulsed, it is crucial to preserve the periodontal ligament cells on the root surface to increase the chances of successful reimplantation. The best medium for transporting an avulsed tooth is one that maintains the vitality of these cells. Milk is considered an ideal transport medium because it is isotonic, has a neutral pH, and contains nutrients that help preserve the periodontal ligament cells. Normal saline is less ideal because it lacks nutrients, and water is not recommended as it can cause cell lysis due to its hypotonic nature. Wrapping the tooth in gauze soaked in normal saline is also not ideal as it does not provide the necessary environment to preserve the cells. Therefore, the best method to transport the tooth is submerged in milk.",9
1155,"The patient's symptoms and MRI findings are suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS). She has had episodes of neurological deficits that have resolved and new symptoms that have appeared, which is characteristic of relapsing-remitting MS. The presence of gadolinium-enhancing lesions indicates active inflammation. The electric sensation upon neck flexion (Lhermitte's sign) is also associated with MS. In the acute setting of an MS relapse, the most appropriate treatment is high-dose intravenous corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and hasten recovery. Therefore, the next step in management is to administer IV methylprednisolone.",9
1159,"The infectious disease chairperson is implementing a process to improve the situation by making changes and observing the outcomes. Initially, she restricts clindamycin use and observes the effect on C. difficile infections. After evaluating the results, she decides to further restrict fluoroquinolones and plans to review the outcomes again. This iterative process of planning a change, implementing it, studying the results, and then acting based on those results aligns with the Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) cycle. This cycle is a method used for testing and implementing changes in a controlled way to improve processes.",9
1162,"The examination finding described is a positive valgus stress test, which indicates increased laxity when an abducting force is applied to the knee. This test is used to assess the integrity of the medial collateral ligament (MCL). When the knee is flexed to 30° and an abducting force is applied, increased laxity suggests damage to the MCL, as it resists valgus stress (abduction of the lower leg).",9
1160,"The patient is experiencing symptoms consistent with stable angina, which is chest pain due to myocardial ischemia that occurs with exertion and is relieved by rest. The goal of treatment is to reduce myocardial oxygen demand or increase oxygen supply. Beta-blockers, which block beta-1 adrenergic receptors, are commonly used to manage stable angina. They work by decreasing heart rate and contractility, thereby reducing myocardial oxygen demand. This makes beta-1 adrenergic receptor blockers the most appropriate choice to prevent future episodes of chest pain in this patient.",9
1161,"The clinical presentation of a 3-month-old with fever, irritability, and a rash that started around the mouth and spread to the trunk and extremities, along with flaccid bullae and a positive Nikolsky sign (blister formation with gentle pressure), is suggestive of Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSSS). This condition is caused by the exfoliative toxin produced by Staphylococcus aureus, which cleaves desmoglein 1, a component of desmosomes in the epidermis. This leads to the separation of the epidermal layers and the formation of blisters. The absence of mucosal involvement (normal oropharyngeal examination) further supports this diagnosis, as SSSS typically does not affect mucous membranes.",9
1163,"The patient is experiencing symptoms consistent with overactive bladder (OAB), characterized by increased urinary frequency, urgency, and occasional incontinence. She has already attempted lifestyle modifications such as pelvic floor exercises, reducing caffeine intake, and weight loss, which are appropriate first-line interventions. The absence of urinary hesitancy or hematuria, along with her medical history and current medications, does not suggest other causes like urinary tract infection or obstruction. Oxybutynin is an anticholinergic medication used to treat OAB by reducing bladder muscle spasms, making it the most appropriate next step in management for her symptoms.",9
1166,"The clinical presentation suggests a possible immunodeficiency, particularly one affecting the ability to handle intracellular pathogens like mycobacteria and salmonella. The BCG vaccine contains live attenuated Mycobacterium bovis, and an adverse reaction to it can indicate a defect in the IL-12/IFN-gamma axis, which is crucial for macrophage activation and intracellular pathogen clearance. The history of recurrent salmonella infections further supports this, as these infections are also typically controlled by the same immune pathway. In this context, a defect in the production or response to interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) is likely, as it is a key cytokine in activating macrophages to kill intracellular pathogens. Therefore, serological analysis would most likely reveal decreased levels of interferon gamma.",9
1167,"The question describes a drug that inhibits the formation of deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) and leads to the accumulation of deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP). This mechanism is characteristic of drugs that interfere with thymidylate synthase, an enzyme crucial for the conversion of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to dTMP. Capecitabine is a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which inhibits thymidylate synthase, leading to decreased dTMP and increased dUTP. The advice to avoid folic acid supplementation is relevant because folic acid can enhance the effects of 5-FU, potentially increasing toxicity. Therefore, the drug given is most likely Capecitabine.",9
1133,,0
1172,"The patient presents with confusion, somnolence, and laboratory findings indicative of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS), given the extremely high glucose level (1,299 mg/dL) and normal sodium level. The patient is also tachycardic and has dry mucous membranes, suggesting significant dehydration. The potassium level is low at 3.0 mEq/L, which is a concern because insulin administration can further lower potassium levels by driving potassium into cells. The initial treatment for HHS involves aggressive fluid resuscitation with normal saline to address dehydration and improve perfusion. Potassium replacement is also necessary due to the hypokalemia. Insulin therapy is important but should be delayed until potassium levels are corrected to avoid exacerbating hypokalemia. Therefore, the most appropriate initial treatment is normal saline and potassium.",9
1177,"The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are suggestive of ankylosing spondylitis, a type of inflammatory arthritis that primarily affects the spine and sacroiliac joints. The key features include lower back pain that is worse in the morning and improves with activity, decreased spinal range of motion, and decreased chest expansion. The absence of neurological deficits and the improvement with NSAIDs like ibuprofen further support this diagnosis. 

The most appropriate next step in the evaluation of suspected ankylosing spondylitis is imaging of the sacroiliac joints to look for sacroiliitis. While MRI can detect early changes, a radiograph of the sacroiliac joint is typically the initial imaging study performed to identify structural changes consistent with the disease.",9
1182,"The patient is a 16-year-old male with delayed puberty and anosmia (lack of sense of smell). These symptoms are characteristic of Kallmann syndrome, which is a form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Kallmann syndrome is caused by a failure of the migration of GnRH-producing neurons from the olfactory placode to the hypothalamus during embryonic development. This failure of neuronal migration also affects the olfactory neurons, leading to anosmia. Therefore, the underlying issue in Kallmann syndrome is a failure of normal neuronal migration during development.",10
1171,"The patient presents with symptoms of urethritis, including burning with urination and clear urethral discharge. The Gram stain of the urethral swab shows neutrophils but no organisms, which is a key detail. Neisseria gonorrhoeae would typically show gram-negative diplococci on a Gram stain, so it is unlikely to be the cause here. Adenovirus can cause urethritis but is less common and typically associated with systemic symptoms like conjunctivitis. Trichomonas vaginalis is a protozoan and would not be visible on a Gram stain. Chlamydia trachomatis, however, is an intracellular organism that does not show up on a Gram stain, making it the most likely cause of the symptoms in this case.",9
1187,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest mitral stenosis, likely due to rheumatic heart disease, given her history of joint pain and fever in childhood and her origin from a region where rheumatic fever is more common. The auscultation findings of an opening snap followed by a diastolic murmur are characteristic of mitral stenosis. In mitral stenosis, the left atrium becomes enlarged due to increased pressure from the stenotic mitral valve. This enlargement can lead to atrial fibrillation and increased pressure in the pulmonary circulation, potentially causing pulmonary hypertension. However, the most direct complication related to the anatomical changes is the risk of esophageal compression due to the enlarged left atrium pressing against the esophagus. This is a classic complication of untreated mitral stenosis.",9
1199,"In sickle cell disease, different age groups tend to experience different complications. Pediatric patients are more prone to splenic sequestration (I) due to the spleen's role in filtering abnormal cells, which can lead to sudden pooling of blood in the spleen. Acute chest syndrome (IV) is also common in children and is a severe complication involving the lungs. Nephropathy (V) is more common in adults due to long-term kidney damage. Avascular necrosis (II) and pulmonary hypertension (III) are also more common in adults. Therefore, the complications more likely in pediatric patients are splenic sequestration and acute chest syndrome.",9
1193,"The patient is a healthy 24-year-old woman planning to conceive within the next year. Her menstrual cycles are regular, and she has a normal BMI. She does not have any dietary restrictions or medical conditions that would necessitate vitamin B12 or iron supplementation. The most important recommendation for women planning to conceive is to begin folate supplementation. Folate is crucial for preventing neural tube defects in the developing fetus, and it is recommended that women of childbearing age take folic acid supplements before conception and during early pregnancy.",9
1211,"In this clinical trial, patients are analyzed based on the initial group they were assigned to, regardless of whether they completed the treatment as assigned or switched to another treatment. This approach is known as 'intention to treat' (ITT) analysis. ITT analysis includes all randomized participants in the groups to which they were originally assigned, preserving the benefits of randomization and providing an unbiased estimate of treatment effect. This method is particularly useful in maintaining the comparability of groups and is the standard approach in superiority trials to avoid biases introduced by non-compliance or loss to follow-up.",9
1202,"In patients with diabetes mellitus, regular monitoring of blood pressure is crucial due to the increased risk of cardiovascular complications. The standard of care involves measuring blood pressure at each visit to ensure it remains within target ranges, as hypertension can exacerbate diabetic complications. Even though the patient has a diary with normal readings, it is still important for the physician to verify these measurements during the visit to ensure accuracy and consistency with clinical standards. Therefore, the physician should measure the blood pressure at this visit.",9
1210,"The patient's presentation is consistent with tinea versicolor, a common skin condition caused by the overgrowth of Malassezia species, particularly Malassezia globosa. The key features include hypopigmented macules with fine scaling, which are often seen after sun exposure in warm, humid environments like Puerto Rico. The scraping of the lesions revealing fine scaling is characteristic of this condition. The other options do not fit the clinical picture: autoimmune destruction of melanocytes (A) would suggest vitiligo, which presents differently; antigen uptake by Langerhans cells (C) is related to contact dermatitis, which would be pruritic; and infection with Trichophyton rubrum (D) is associated with dermatophytosis, which typically presents with erythematous, scaly patches.",9
1219,"The patient presents with jaundice, ascites, gynecomastia, palmar erythema, and peripheral edema, which are indicative of liver dysfunction. The history of multiple sexual partners and recent loss of libido suggest possible chronic liver disease, potentially due to viral hepatitis. Chronic viral hepatitis, particularly hepatitis B or C, can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure, explaining the symptoms. The absence of significant alcohol use and the presence of risk factors for viral transmission make chronic viral hepatitis the most likely cause.",9
1221,"The patient has been started on antiretroviral therapy (ART) with dolutegravir, tenofovir, and emtricitabine. After 3 months of effective ART, we expect the following changes:

1. **CD4+/CD8+ ratio:** This ratio is expected to increase as the CD4+ T cell count rises with effective ART. The patient's initial CD4+ count was low, indicating immunosuppression. Successful ART should lead to an increase in CD4+ cells, improving the CD4+/CD8+ ratio.

2. **HIV RNA (viral load):** Effective ART should lead to a significant decrease in HIV RNA levels, ideally to undetectable levels. This indicates that the virus is being effectively suppressed.

3. **HIV antibody test:** The HIV antibody test will remain positive. Once a person has developed antibodies to HIV, they will remain positive even if the virus is suppressed by ART.

Therefore, the most likely set of laboratory findings after 3 months of effective ART is an increase in the CD4+/CD8+ ratio, a decrease in HIV RNA, and a positive HIV antibody test.",9
1231,"The infant's symptoms and presentation are suggestive of phenylketonuria (PKU), a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This leads to an accumulation of phenylalanine and its metabolites, which can cause neurological damage if not managed. The musty odor, fair skin, and eczema are classic signs of PKU. The treatment involves a diet low in phenylalanine to prevent its accumulation. Additionally, large neutral amino acids can be included in the diet to help compete with phenylalanine for transport across the blood-brain barrier, potentially reducing its neurotoxic effects.",9
1234,"The clinical presentation and lab findings suggest Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), which is often associated with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (such as E. coli O157:H7). The key features of HUS include acute renal failure (elevated creatinine), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (low hemoglobin). The presence of Shiga-like toxin supports this diagnosis. In HUS, microthrombi form in small vessels, particularly in the kidneys, leading to the characteristic renal damage. Therefore, the finding of microthrombi within glomerular vessels on kidney biopsy is consistent with HUS.",9
1241,"The patient has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is known to have a complex genetic basis. Unlike monogenic forms of diabetes such as MODY, type 2 diabetes is not caused by a single genetic mutation. Instead, it involves multiple genes that contribute to the risk of developing the disease. This is known as polygenic inheritance, where the combined effect of several genes, along with environmental factors such as obesity and lifestyle, leads to the development of the condition. The patient's obesity and lack of family history suggest that environmental factors may have played a significant role in his case, but the genetic predisposition is still polygenic.",9
1246,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's granulomatosis). Key features include upper respiratory tract involvement (sinus congestion, nasal septum perforation), renal involvement (elevated creatinine, RBC casts), and positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). The presence of granulomatous inflammation and vasculitis in small to medium-sized vessels is characteristic of this condition. Therefore, the biopsy finding most consistent with this diagnosis is granulomatous vasculitis of small and medium-sized vessels.",9
1244,"The patient's symptoms of blurred vision, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, arm weakness, and respiratory issues, along with his recent consumption of canned foods, suggest botulism. Botulism is caused by a toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum, which inhibits the release of acetylcholine (ACh) at neuromuscular junctions. This leads to the characteristic flaccid paralysis and autonomic symptoms such as dilated pupils and decreased reflexes. The history of consuming canned foods is a key clue, as improperly canned foods can harbor the botulinum toxin. The other options do not fit as well with the presentation:",9
1254,"The patient is a 71-year-old woman with osteoporosis and vertebral compression fractures. She has been taking prednisone for rheumatoid arthritis for the last 2 years. Chronic corticosteroid use is a well-known risk factor for secondary osteoporosis because it leads to decreased bone formation and increased bone resorption. While decreased estrogen levels are a common cause of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, the chronic use of corticosteroids is more directly related to her current condition. Hydrochlorothiazide is not typically associated with causing osteoporosis and may even have a mild protective effect on bone density. Calcium malabsorption is not indicated in this scenario as she has been taking supplements. Therefore, the main cause of her osteoporosis is the chronic corticosteroid use.",9
1255,"The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.32, which indicates acidemia (normal pH is 7.35-7.45). The pCO2 is 70 mmHg, which is elevated (normal pCO2 is 35-45 mmHg), suggesting a respiratory component. The sodium bicarbonate level is 30 mg/dl, which is elevated (normal bicarbonate is 22-26 mEq/L), indicating metabolic compensation. In respiratory acidosis, the primary disturbance is an increase in pCO2, leading to a decrease in pH. The elevated bicarbonate level suggests renal compensation for the respiratory acidosis. Therefore, the primary disturbance is respiratory acidosis.",9
1253,"The patient presents with normocytic anemia, as indicated by the normal MCV of 88 μm3. The low hemoglobin and erythrocyte count suggest anemia, but the normal MCV indicates that the anemia is not due to a microcytic or macrocytic process. In normocytic anemia, it is important to determine whether the anemia is due to decreased production or increased destruction of red blood cells. A reticulocyte count helps differentiate between these two possibilities. A low reticulocyte count would suggest decreased production, while a high reticulocyte count would suggest increased destruction or loss. Therefore, the best next step is to check the reticulocyte count to guide further management.",9
1263,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), including a malar rash, oral ulcers, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, positive ANA, and positive anti-Smith antibodies. The presence of proteinuria suggests possible lupus nephritis, although there are no RBC casts or RBCs in the urine. The most appropriate next step in management is to confirm the diagnosis of lupus nephritis and assess its severity, which is best done with a renal biopsy. This will guide further treatment decisions, such as the use of immunosuppressive therapy.",9
1268,"In a case-control study, especially when the investigators are also the attending physicians, there is a risk of interviewer bias. This bias can occur if the interviewers have preconceived notions about the association between certain risk factors and depression, potentially influencing how they collect or interpret data. Blinding the investigators would help mitigate this bias by preventing them from knowing which participants are cases and which are controls, thus reducing the potential for differential data collection or interpretation based on the participants' group status. Including more interviewers (option A) does not necessarily reduce bias unless they are also blinded. Options C and D relate to statistical analysis adjustments and are not directly related to reducing bias in data collection.",9
1265,"The clinical presentation of the child, including fever, runny nose, hoarseness, severe dry cough, and stridor, along with the barking cough and the x-ray finding of subglottic narrowing (steeple sign), is characteristic of croup. Croup is most commonly caused by the parainfluenza virus. The age of the child and the symptoms align with this diagnosis, as croup typically affects young children and presents with these respiratory symptoms.",9
1257,"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with oral thrush, which is a fungal infection caused by Candida species. The white plaques that bleed when scraped off are characteristic of this condition. The patient's use of inhaled corticosteroids, such as fluticasone, can predispose her to developing oral thrush. The most appropriate treatment for oral thrush is an antifungal medication. Nystatin is an antifungal agent commonly used to treat oral candidiasis. Triamcinolone is a corticosteroid, acyclovir is an antiviral, and griseofulvin is used for dermatophyte infections, none of which are appropriate for treating oral thrush.",10
1269,"The patient is experiencing symptoms such as galactorrhea (milky-white discharge from the breasts), amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), and decreased libido. These symptoms are consistent with hyperprolactinemia, which can be caused by a decrease in dopamine activity in the tuberoinfundibular pathway. Dopamine normally inhibits prolactin secretion from the anterior pituitary gland. Risperidone, an antipsychotic medication, is known to block dopamine receptors, particularly in the tuberoinfundibular pathway, leading to increased prolactin levels and the symptoms observed in this patient.",9
1264,"The patient presents with symptoms and findings suggestive of infective endocarditis, including fever, splinter hemorrhages, Osler nodes, and retinal hemorrhages. The echocardiogram shows vegetations on the aortic valve, and the culture reveals a gram-positive alpha-hemolytic organism growing in chains, resistant to optochin, and fermenting sorbitol. These characteristics are consistent with Streptococcus viridans group, particularly Streptococcus mutans or Streptococcus sanguinis, which are known to be part of the normal oral flora and are commonly associated with dental procedures. This organism is not associated with colon cancer (which is linked to Streptococcus bovis), pneumonia (which is linked to Streptococcus pneumoniae), or sexual activity (which is linked to organisms like Neisseria gonorrhoeae). Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is associated with dental procedures.",9
1275,"The patient's clinical presentation, including dyspnea, reduced DLCO, and a BMPR2 gene mutation, is indicative of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The BMPR2 mutation is commonly associated with familial PAH. The right heart catheterization is used to confirm elevated pulmonary artery pressures. In PAH, vasodilators are used to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance and improve symptoms. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacologic therapy for this condition is a vasodilator.",9
1272,"The patient's presentation includes stupor, hypothermia, bradycardia, respiratory depression, dry mucous membranes, and miosis (small pupils). These symptoms are consistent with opioid intoxication. Heroin, an opioid, is known to cause these effects, particularly the triad of respiratory depression, miosis, and altered mental status. The absence of injection marks does not rule out heroin use, as it can be taken by other routes such as snorting or smoking. Amitriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant) would typically cause anticholinergic symptoms like dilated pupils and dry skin. Phencyclidine (PCP) often causes nystagmus and agitation. MDMA (ecstasy) usually causes hyperthermia and dilated pupils. Therefore, the most likely cause of her symptoms is heroin.",9
1201,,0
1274,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus. The symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, and lethargy, along with the presence of ketones and glucose in the urine, support this diagnosis. In DKA, there is a metabolic acidosis with an anion gap due to the accumulation of ketone bodies. This leads to a compensatory respiratory alkalosis, resulting in deep and labored breathing (Kussmaul respirations) to blow off CO2. Therefore, arterial pCO2 is decreased, not increased. The blood pH is decreased due to acidosis, not increased. Serum glucose levels in DKA are typically elevated but not as high as >800 mg/dL, which is more characteristic of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS). In DKA, there is a total body potassium deficit due to osmotic diuresis and shifts of potassium out of cells in exchange for hydrogen ions, despite normal or elevated serum potassium levels. Thus, the most likely finding is decreased total body potassium.",9
1279,"The patient has a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which can progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The laboratory findings show pancytopenia (anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia), which is consistent with bone marrow failure or infiltration. The presence of petechiae and pale conjunctivae suggests thrombocytopenia and anemia, respectively. The peripheral blood smear, although not visible here, likely shows blasts, which would be consistent with AML. The painless cervical lymphadenopathy is not typical for AML but can occur. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) typically presents with leukocytosis and is associated with the Philadelphia chromosome. Hairy cell leukemia usually presents with splenomegaly and a different blood smear appearance. Primary myelofibrosis often presents with splenomegaly and teardrop-shaped red cells. Given the history of MDS and the current findings, progression to AML is the most likely explanation.",9
1277,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of acute pancreatitis, including upper abdominal pain radiating to the back, nausea, elevated amylase, and hypocalcemia. The vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia, which are indicative of shock. In the context of acute pancreatitis, the most likely cause of these vital sign abnormalities is capillary leakage. This occurs due to the inflammatory process associated with pancreatitis, leading to increased vascular permeability and third-spacing of fluids, resulting in hypovolemia and hypotension. The warm extremities suggest distributive shock, which is consistent with capillary leakage rather than hemorrhagic fluid loss or decreased cardiac output.",9
1278,"The patient has major depressive disorder and is experiencing symptoms such as depressed mood, amotivation, overeating, and anhedonia. He also has a history of erectile dysfunction, which worsened with sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Therefore, an antidepressant that does not exacerbate erectile dysfunction is preferred. Additionally, the patient wants to quit smoking, and bupropion is known to aid in smoking cessation. Bupropion is also less likely to cause sexual side effects compared to SSRIs and SNRIs. Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant with significant anticholinergic side effects and is not ideal for someone with asthma. Citalopram, another SSRI, could worsen erectile dysfunction. Mirtazapine can cause weight gain, which may not be ideal given the patient's BMI. Therefore, bupropion is the most appropriate choice.",9
1282,"The patient presents with chest discomfort, palpitations, and tachycardia (heart rate of 125 bpm). Given the symptoms and the absence of significant past medical history, it's important to consider common causes of palpitations and tachycardia. Hyperthyroidism can cause these symptoms, and checking the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level is a standard part of the initial work-up for unexplained tachycardia and palpitations. Other options like urine free cortisol level and urine metanephrines are more specific for conditions like Cushing's syndrome and pheochromocytoma, respectively, which are less likely given the presentation. A chest x-ray is not directly useful for diagnosing the cause of palpitations and tachycardia in this context.",9
1289,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a rapidly progressive neurological disorder. The key features include rapid cognitive decline, personality changes, myoclonus (involuntary muscle twitches), and recent travel history. These symptoms are highly suggestive of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a prion disease characterized by rapidly progressive dementia and myoclonus. One of the hallmark findings in CJD is the presence of periodic sharp wave complexes on EEG. The other options, such as blood in the subarachnoid space, multifocal infarction, and tear of a bridging vein, are more indicative of other conditions like subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, or subdural hematoma, respectively, which do not match the clinical presentation as closely as CJD does.",9
1281,"The clinical presentation and biopsy findings suggest Hodgkin lymphoma, characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells (multinucleate giant lymphocytes with prominent nucleoli). The patient's symptoms, including alcohol-induced lymph node pain, fatigue, low-grade fevers, and pruritus, are consistent with this diagnosis.

In Hodgkin lymphoma, certain factors are associated with a poorer prognosis. These include the presence of B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss), a large mediastinal mass (greater than one-third of the chest's width), high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and certain histological subtypes.

Option A describes a mediastinal tumor occupying 7% of the chest's width, which is not large enough to be considered a poor prognostic factor (it would need to be greater than one-third of the chest's width).

Option B describes an axillary tumor 6 cm across, which is not a specific poor prognostic factor in Hodgkin lymphoma.

Option C describes the nodular lymphocyte predominant type, which is generally associated with a better prognosis compared to classical Hodgkin lymphoma.

Option D describes an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 65 mm/h. A high ESR is associated with a poorer prognosis in Hodgkin lymphoma as it indicates more systemic inflammation and disease activity.

Therefore, the additional finding associated with a poor prognosis in this patient is a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate.",9
1299,"The patient's symptoms and recent travel history are key to identifying the likely cause of his illness. He presents with severe fever, headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and a rash. These symptoms are consistent with dengue fever, which is endemic in tropical regions such as Brazil, Panama, and Peru. The fact that he spent time outdoors without protection against insect bites suggests exposure to mosquitoes, which are the vectors for dengue fever. The absence of organisms on a peripheral blood smear rules out malaria, which would typically show Plasmodium species. Babesiosis is transmitted by ticks and is not common in the regions he visited. Chagas disease is transmitted by triatomine bugs and does not present with these acute symptoms. Therefore, the most likely cause of his symptoms is dengue fever.",9
1300,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of reactive arthritis, which is a type of spondyloarthritis that occurs after a gastrointestinal or genitourinary infection. The key features include arthritis, typically affecting the lower limbs, and a history of preceding infection. The patient has already been treated with naproxen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), but continues to experience symptoms. 

Diclofenac and ketoprofen are also NSAIDs, similar to naproxen, and are unlikely to provide additional benefit if naproxen was ineffective. Ceftriaxone is an antibiotic, which would not be appropriate unless there was an active bacterial infection requiring treatment.

Sulfasalazine is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) that is often used in the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions like reactive arthritis, especially when NSAIDs are insufficient. It can help reduce inflammation and improve joint symptoms in patients with persistent arthritis.

Therefore, sulfasalazine is likely to be the most beneficial therapy for this patient.",9
1297,"The newborn presents with jaundice at 2 weeks of age, with a total bilirubin level of 16.1 mg/dL and a direct (conjugated) bilirubin level of 0.7 mg/dL, indicating predominantly unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The history of an older sibling who died after liver surgery suggests a possible genetic or familial condition. The liver is slightly enlarged, but the liver function tests (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase) are normal, which is not typical for biliary atresia, where conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and elevated liver enzymes are expected. Physiologic neonatal jaundice typically peaks at 2-3 days and resolves by 1-2 weeks, so it is unlikely at 2 weeks. Isoimmune hemolysis would present with anemia and reticulocytosis, which is not indicated here. Breast milk jaundice is a common cause of prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in breastfed infants, typically peaking at 2-3 weeks of age, which fits this case.",9
1302,"The clinical presentation and genetic findings in this case are suggestive of Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), a condition characterized by features of premature aging. The key genetic defect in HGPS is a point mutation in the LMNA gene, which encodes for lamin A, a protein that is part of the nuclear lamina. Lamin A is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the nuclear envelope. The mutation leads to the production of a defective form of lamin A called progerin, which causes the nuclear membrane to become deformed and unstable, resulting in the symptoms of premature aging. The other proteins listed (desmin, nesprin, and plectin) are not associated with this condition. Desmin is a muscle-specific intermediate filament, nesprin is involved in nuclear-cytoskeletal connections, and plectin is a cytoskeletal cross-linking protein. Therefore, the defective protein in this case is lamin.",9
1305,"The patient is experiencing intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) at 26 weeks' gestation, as indicated by the absence of fetal cardiac activity on ultrasound. The cervix is already dilated to 3 cm, suggesting that labor may be imminent. In cases of IUFD after 20 weeks, the preferred management is to induce labor to deliver the fetus. Oxytocin is commonly used to induce labor in such situations. Cesarean delivery is not indicated unless there are specific maternal or fetal indications, which are not present here. Dilation and curettage is typically used for fetal demise before 20 weeks. Magnesium sulfate is used for neuroprotection in preterm labor or for seizure prophylaxis in preeclampsia, neither of which applies here. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to plan for oxytocin administration to induce labor.",9
1306,"The patient presents with excessive daytime sleepiness, loud snoring, morning headaches, and a high BMI, which are suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is characterized by repeated episodes of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway during sleep, leading to disrupted sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. The underlying mechanism in OSA is poor oropharyngeal tone, which causes the airway to collapse during sleep, resulting in apneas and hypopneas. This aligns with the patient's symptoms and history, particularly the loud snoring and large body habitus.",9
1307,"The clinical presentation of the child suggests cat scratch disease, which is caused by Bartonella henselae. The key clues are the exposure to cats at the shelter, the papular lesion on the hand (likely the site of a cat scratch or bite), and the tender lymphadenopathy. The initial maculopapular rash and the current symptoms of fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy are consistent with this diagnosis. The most appropriate treatment for cat scratch disease, especially with significant lymphadenopathy, is azithromycin.",9
1308,"The key details in this scenario are that the child wakes up frightened, is consolable, and remembers the bad dream. These features are characteristic of nightmares, which occur during REM sleep. In contrast, sleep terrors occur during non-REM sleep, and the child typically does not remember the event and is difficult to console. The child also seems more tired the next day, which aligns with disrupted sleep due to nightmares. There is no indication of trauma or PTSD, and while some sleep disturbances can be part of normal development, the specific pattern described here fits nightmare disorder.",9
1311,"The patient is taking valproic acid, which is known to be teratogenic and can cause neural tube defects in the developing fetus. Neural tube defects can lead to conditions such as spina bifida, which may require surgical intervention after birth. Lower spinal surgery is often necessary to correct or manage complications associated with spina bifida. Therefore, the child is at increased risk for requiring lower spinal surgery due to the potential teratogenic effects of valproic acid.",9
1316,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), including morning stiffness, joint pain, and swelling in the hands, particularly affecting the metacarpophalangeal joints. The radiographic finding of periarticular osteopenia supports this diagnosis. While methotrexate is the first-line disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) for long-term management of RA, the question asks for the next best step in managing acute symptoms. Prednisone, a corticosteroid, is effective for rapid relief of inflammation and pain in acute RA flares. Anakinra and etanercept are biologic agents used in RA but are not typically first-line for acute symptom management. Therefore, prednisone is the best choice for immediate symptom relief.",9
1322,"The patient presents with symptoms of mania, including decreased need for sleep, increased activity, grandiosity, and rapid speech. These symptoms have been present for 10 days, which meets the criteria for a manic episode. She also has a history of a similar episode 2 years ago, which required hospitalization, indicating a severe manic episode. Additionally, she describes a period of low energy and motivation lasting for months, suggestive of a depressive episode. The presence of at least one manic episode is sufficient for a diagnosis of Bipolar I disorder. Bipolar II disorder requires hypomanic episodes, which are less severe than manic episodes and do not require hospitalization. Major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder do not account for the manic symptoms.",9
1326,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs consistent with heart failure, likely due to ischemic cardiomyopathy given his history of myocardial infarction. In heart failure, certain laboratory and clinical findings are associated with prognosis. 

A. Decreased BNP levels would typically indicate less severe heart failure, as BNP is released in response to ventricular stretch and volume overload.

B. Decreased serum Na+ (hyponatremia) is a poor prognostic indicator in heart failure. It reflects neurohormonal activation and fluid overload, and is associated with increased mortality.

C. Increased VO2 (oxygen consumption) would generally indicate better exercise capacity and is not typically associated with increased mortality in heart failure.

D. Increased heart rate variability is generally a sign of good autonomic function and is associated with better outcomes in heart failure.

Given these considerations, decreased serum Na+ is most strongly associated with increased mortality in heart failure patients.",9
1324,"The presentation of a palpable mass in the scrotum with mild testicular pain suggests a condition affecting the testicular region. The key detail here is the abnormal appearance of the scrotum around the left testis. 

Option A describes compression of the left renal vein, which is associated with a varicocele, often presenting as a 'bag of worms' appearance in the scrotum. This is a common cause of a scrotal mass and is more prevalent on the left side due to anatomical reasons.

Option B involves an infection leading to epididymitis, which typically presents with more significant pain and possibly systemic symptoms like fever.

Option C refers to cryptorchidism, which would not present as a scrotal mass but rather an absent testis in the scrotum.

Option D describes testicular torsion, which usually presents with acute, severe pain and is a surgical emergency.

Given the description of a palpable mass and mild pain, the most likely etiology is a varicocele due to compression of the left renal vein.",9
1323,"The patient, an elderly woman with a history of atrial fibrillation and on anticoagulation therapy (apixaban), presents with symptoms of shock (hypotension, tachycardia, diaphoresis, pallor, cold and clammy skin) after a fall. She has a significant ecchymosis over the left temple and severe hip pain with swelling and tenderness, suggesting a possible fracture. Given her anticoagulation therapy and the fall, she is at high risk for significant bleeding. The sudden decline in her condition is likely due to blood loss, either from a potential intracranial hemorrhage or more likely from a hip fracture leading to internal bleeding. The absence of P waves on ECG is consistent with her known atrial fibrillation. Pulmonary embolism, brain herniation, and sepsis are less likely given the acute presentation and context of trauma with anticoagulation.",9
1331,"The clinical findings in the newborn suggest a pattern of anomalies consistent with a teratogenic effect. The features described include a short, mildly webbed neck, low-set ears, ocular hypertelorism, slanted palpebral fissures, cleft palate, hypoplasia of the nails and distal phalanges, and increased coarse hair on the body and face. These findings are characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, which is associated with maternal use of phenytoin during pregnancy. Phenytoin is an anticonvulsant medication, and its teratogenic effects can lead to the described craniofacial and limb abnormalities. Other options such as maternal diabetes mellitus and maternal alcohol intake can cause different sets of anomalies, but they do not match the specific pattern seen here. Fetal posterior urethral valves would not cause these findings, as they are related to urinary tract obstruction and oligohydramnios, not the described dysmorphic features.",9
1327,"To calculate the relative risk (RR), we need to compare the risk of developing the disease in the exposed group to the risk in the unexposed group. 

1. Calculate the risk in the exposed group: 
   - 30% of the exposed patients contracted the disease. 
   - Therefore, the risk in the exposed group is 30/100 = 0.30.

2. Calculate the risk in the unexposed group:
   - 1% of the unexposed patients contracted the disease.
   - Therefore, the risk in the unexposed group is 1/100 = 0.01.

3. Calculate the relative risk (RR):
   - RR = Risk in exposed group / Risk in unexposed group = 0.30 / 0.01 = 30.

Now, let's match this calculation to the options provided:

- Option A: [30 / (30 + 70)] / [1 / (1 + 99)] simplifies to 0.30 / 0.01, which is the correct calculation for RR.
- Option B: (30 * 99) / (70 * 1) is the calculation for the odds ratio, not the relative risk.
- Option C: (70 * 1) / (39 * 99) is incorrect for both RR and OR.
- Option D: [1 / (1 + 99)] / 30 / (30 + 70)] is the inverse of the correct RR calculation.

Therefore, the correct answer is A.",9
1333,"The patient's symptoms and clinical findings suggest a connective tissue disorder, likely systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). The progressive dysphagia, starting with solids and progressing to liquids, along with skin thickening, telangiectasias, and Raynaud's phenomenon, are characteristic of this condition. In systemic sclerosis, esophageal dysphagia is typically due to atrophy and fibrosis of the esophageal smooth muscle, leading to decreased peristalsis and lower esophageal sphincter dysfunction. This matches the description of esophageal smooth muscle atrophy and fibrosis.",9
1329,"The patient's diagnosis is invasive ovarian carcinoma without metastasis. Invasive carcinoma is characterized by the ability of cancer cells to invade through the basement membrane into surrounding tissues. This process often involves the loss of cell adhesion molecules, such as E-cadherin, which normally help maintain cell-to-cell adhesion. The loss of E-cadherin allows cancer cells to detach from each other and invade surrounding tissues, which is a hallmark of invasive carcinoma. 

Option A, 'Intact basement membrane,' would not be consistent with invasive carcinoma, as invasion involves breaching the basement membrane. 

Option C, 'Seeding via capillaries,' refers to metastasis, which is not present in this case. 

Option D, 'Increased proliferation of cells with preservation of size and shape,' describes hyperplasia or dysplasia, not invasive carcinoma.

Therefore, the cellular change consistent with invasive carcinoma is the 'Loss of E-cadherin.'",9
1334,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of serum sickness-like reaction, which is characterized by fever, rash, arthralgia, and sometimes proteinuria following exposure to certain medications, often antibiotics like beta-lactams or sulfonamides. The boy developed these symptoms after starting antibiotics for pharyngitis, indicating a likely drug reaction. The most appropriate initial step in managing a suspected drug-induced serum sickness-like reaction is to discontinue the offending medication. This often leads to resolution of symptoms. Administering prednisone can be considered if symptoms are severe or do not resolve after stopping the medication, but the first step is to stop the drug. Switching to doxycycline or performing allergy testing are not immediate steps in this scenario.",9
1335,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a case of pneumonia, likely caused by Legionella pneumophila. Key points include the presence of cough, shortness of breath, fever, and diarrhea, along with hyponatremia (low sodium level). The chest x-ray shows consolidation, and the Gram stain of sputum shows neutrophils but no organisms, which is typical for Legionella as it does not stain well with Gram stain. The patient's history of smoking and chronic bronchitis increases her risk for respiratory infections. Levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, is effective against Legionella and is the most appropriate choice for this atypical pneumonia.",9
1340,"The patient presents with dysphagia, weight loss, and a palpable thyroid nodule. Her thyroid function tests show suppressed TSH and elevated T4 and T3, indicating hyperthyroidism. Given the presence of a thyroid nodule and hyperthyroidism, the next step is to determine if the nodule is functioning (producing thyroid hormone) or non-functioning. Thyroid scintigraphy (a radioactive iodine uptake scan) is used to assess whether the nodule is 'hot' (functioning) or 'cold' (non-functioning). This will guide further management, as 'hot' nodules are usually benign and may be treated with radioactive iodine or surgery, while 'cold' nodules may require further evaluation for malignancy.",9
1338,"The clinical presentation suggests an ectopic pregnancy, given the positive pregnancy test, empty uterus on ultrasound, and presence of free pelvic fluid. The standard medical treatment for an ectopic pregnancy is methotrexate, a folate antagonist. Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, leading to a decrease in tetrahydrofolate production. This results in decreased synthesis of thymidylate and purines, which are necessary for DNA synthesis. Specifically, methotrexate causes an increase in deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) because it inhibits the conversion of dUMP to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) by thymidylate synthase, due to the lack of tetrahydrofolate. Therefore, the most likely effect of methotrexate is an increase in deoxyuridine monophosphate.",9
1341,"The symptoms described in the vignette are consistent with croup, which is commonly caused by the parainfluenza virus. Croup typically presents with a ""barking"" cough, stridor (a high-pitched breath sound on inspiration), and respiratory distress, often worsening at night. The presence of supraclavicular retractions and stridor indicates an upper airway obstruction. In croup, the inflammation is primarily located in the subglottic region of the larynx, which is below the vocal cords. This area is narrow and prone to obstruction, leading to the characteristic symptoms of croup.",9
1345,"The patient is unresponsive with a GCS of 3, indicating a potential brain death scenario. To evaluate brain death, the first step is to assess brainstem reflexes, which include checking for pupillary response, corneal reflex, oculocephalic reflex, and gag reflex. These reflexes help determine if there is any brainstem activity. If brainstem reflexes are absent, further confirmatory tests like an apnea test or ancillary tests such as EEG or cerebral angiography may be considered. However, the initial step is to evaluate brainstem reflexes.",9
1343,"The patient's symptoms and physical findings are suggestive of hyperthyroidism, likely due to Graves' disease. The symptoms of heat intolerance, weight loss, anxiety, and insomnia, along with the physical findings of exophthalmos (protuberant eyes) and pretibial myxedema (discoloration and swelling of the shins), are characteristic of Graves' disease. In Graves' disease, there is an overproduction of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) due to stimulation of the thyroid gland by thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins. This leads to a feedback inhibition of TSH production by the pituitary gland, resulting in decreased serum TSH levels. Therefore, the lab result most likely present in this patient is decreased serum TSH.",9
1347,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of hyperthyroidism, including weight loss, tremor, insomnia, lid retraction, and increased reflexes. These symptoms, along with proximal muscle weakness, are consistent with hyperthyroidism, likely due to Graves' disease. In hyperthyroidism, the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is typically decreased due to negative feedback from elevated thyroid hormones (T3 and T4).",9
1348,"The patient presents with hematemesis (vomiting blood) after excessive alcohol consumption and repeated vomiting. This scenario is classic for a Mallory-Weiss tear, which is a tear in the mucosa at the gastroesophageal junction due to forceful vomiting or retching. The key association with this condition is an esophageal tear, which is option D. The other options do not fit the clinical picture: esophageal perforation (option A) would present with more severe symptoms such as chest pain and subcutaneous emphysema; esophageal metaplasia (option B) refers to Barrett's esophagus, which is not related to acute vomiting; and output of the esophageal mucosa (option C) is not a recognized condition.",9
1349,"The patient is a pregnant woman at 23 weeks of gestation presenting with symptoms suggestive of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones), such as flank pain radiating to the groin, hematuria, and urinary frequency. The urinalysis shows significant hematuria and a high pH, which can be associated with certain types of kidney stones. In pregnant patients, imaging studies must be chosen carefully to minimize radiation exposure to the fetus. A noncontrast CT scan, while effective for diagnosing kidney stones, involves radiation and is generally avoided in pregnancy unless absolutely necessary. A renal ultrasound is a safe, non-invasive, and radiation-free method to evaluate for kidney stones in pregnant patients. Therefore, the next best step in management is to perform a renal ultrasound.",9
1318,"The 2-year-old boy is presenting with signs of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which is a type III hypersensitivity reaction. This involves immune complex deposition. We need to find conditions triggered by a similar mechanism.

- **Arthus reaction**: A local type III hypersensitivity reaction involving immune complex deposition.
- **Myasthenia gravis**: A type II hypersensitivity reaction, not involving immune complexes.
- **Acute rheumatic fever**: A type II hypersensitivity reaction involving molecular mimicry, not immune complexes.
- **Polyarteritis nodosa**: A systemic vasculitis associated with hepatitis B immune complexes, thus a type III hypersensitivity reaction.
- **Rheumatoid arthritis**: Involves immune complex deposition in the joints, thus can be considered a type III hypersensitivity reaction.

The conditions that involve a similar mechanism (type III hypersensitivity) are Arthus reaction, Polyarteritis nodosa, and Rheumatoid arthritis.",9
1354,"The patient is experiencing postpartum hemorrhage, likely due to uterine atony, as indicated by the soft, enlarged fundus above the umbilicus. Uterine atony is the most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage. The initial management step for uterine atony is to stimulate uterine contraction. Uterine fundal massage is the most appropriate initial step to help the uterus contract and reduce bleeding. Oxytocin is already being administered, which is appropriate for managing uterine atony, so discontinuing it would not be correct. Methylergonovine is used to treat uterine atony but is not the first step; it is typically used if massage and oxytocin are ineffective. Manual exploration of the uterus is considered if there is suspicion of retained placental tissue or if bleeding persists despite initial management. Therefore, the most appropriate initial step is uterine fundal massage.",9
1356,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with opioid withdrawal. Key features include abdominal pain, diarrhea, runny nose, chills, irritability, insomnia, tachycardia, hypertension, dilated pupils, and piloerection (goosebumps). These symptoms align with withdrawal from heroin, an opioid. The other options do not match this symptom profile: Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid withdrawal typically involves anxiety, insomnia, and tremors; cannabis withdrawal can cause irritability and insomnia but not the full range of symptoms seen here; phencyclidine withdrawal is not typically associated with these symptoms.",9
1352,"The patient is a 48-year-old woman with a BMI of 32 kg/m2, which classifies her as obese. She has a history of normal blood glucose measurement 3 years ago. Given her age and BMI, she is at increased risk for type 2 diabetes. The USPSTF recommends screening for abnormal blood glucose as part of cardiovascular risk assessment in adults aged 40 to 70 years who are overweight or obese. Therefore, a fasting blood glucose test is indicated to screen for diabetes or prediabetes. The other options are not indicated based on her current age and risk factors: an abdominal ultrasound is not routinely recommended for her, a chest CT is not indicated without specific risk factors or symptoms, and a colonoscopy is typically recommended starting at age 50 unless there are additional risk factors.",9
1355,"The patient is a 17-year-old girl with primary amenorrhea, normal breast development, and a blind vaginal pouch. Ultrasound shows the presence of ovaries but no uterus. The presence of normal breast development indicates that estrogen is being produced, which suggests functioning ovaries. The absence of a uterus and the presence of a blind vaginal pouch suggest a problem with the Müllerian ducts. 

Müllerian duct agenesis (Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome) is characterized by the congenital absence of the uterus and the upper part of the vagina, while the ovaries are normal, leading to normal secondary sexual characteristics like breast development. This matches the findings in this patient.

Androgen insensitivity syndrome could also present with a blind vaginal pouch and normal breast development, but typically, the patient would have testes instead of ovaries, as they are genetically male (46,XY).

17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency would lead to lack of sex steroid production and thus lack of breast development.

Pure gonadal dysgenesis would also typically result in lack of breast development due to non-functional gonads.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is Müllerian duct agenesis.",9
1362,"The patient's symptoms of frequent urination, increased thirst, hyperglycemia, darkened skin, and a firm liver mass suggest hemochromatosis. Hemochromatosis is characterized by excessive iron deposition in various organs, including the liver, skin, and pancreas, leading to diabetes (""bronze diabetes""), skin pigmentation, and liver enlargement. The pathogenesis involves defective regulation of iron absorption, often due to mutations in the HFE gene, which affects transferrin receptor binding and iron homeostasis. This leads to increased intestinal iron absorption and subsequent iron overload in tissues.",9
1364,"The patient has a positive PPD test after returning from an area with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, indicating latent TB infection. The drug started is likely isoniazid, which is used for latent TB and works by inhibiting mycolic acid synthesis. The most common adverse effect of isoniazid is liver injury, particularly in older adults. While optic neuropathy is associated with ethambutol, hyperuricemia with pyrazinamide, and nephrotoxicity with aminoglycosides, isoniazid is most known for causing hepatotoxicity.",9
1365,"The patient is a pregnant woman at 11 weeks gestation. During pregnancy, it is common for plasma volume to increase more than the red cell mass, leading to a relative dilution of red blood cells, known as physiological anemia of pregnancy. This is reflected in the normal MCV and normal ferritin levels, indicating that there is no iron deficiency. The reticulocyte count is low, which is consistent with a dilutional effect rather than a true anemia due to decreased production or increased destruction. The normal serum iron and ferritin levels further support that iron deficiency is not the cause. Therefore, the most likely cause of the changes in the blood count is the increase in plasma volume during pregnancy.",9
1368,"The patient presents with acute abdominal pain, nausea, and an irregularly irregular heart rate, which suggests atrial fibrillation. His history includes atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease, which increases the risk for embolic events. The lab results show a metabolic acidosis (low HCO3) and elevated amylase. The acute abdominal pain, metabolic acidosis, and elevated amylase are consistent with acute mesenteric ischemia, which can occur due to embolism from atrial fibrillation. The absence of fever and the patient's history make other options less likely. Peptic ulcer perforation would likely present with signs of peritonitis and possibly free air on imaging. Acute cholecystitis would typically present with localized right upper quadrant pain and fever. Diabetic ketoacidosis is unlikely given the glucose level and lack of ketones or significant hyperglycemia.",9
1363,"The patient presents with a rough, scaly, sandpaper-like plaque on her hand. This description is characteristic of actinic keratosis, which is a precancerous skin lesion caused by sun exposure. The patient's history of sunbathing supports this diagnosis. Psoriasis typically presents with well-demarcated, erythematous plaques with silvery scales, which doesn't match the description. Rosacea usually affects the face with redness and sometimes pustules, not a scaly plaque on the hand. Seborrheic keratosis appears as a waxy, stuck-on lesion, not rough and scaly.",9
1366,"The study described is a case-control study because it starts with the outcome (birth weight) and looks back to assess exposure (second-hand smoke). In a case-control study, the odds ratio is the most appropriate measure of association because it compares the odds of exposure among cases (low birth weight) to the odds of exposure among controls (normal birth weight). Rate ratio and risk difference are measures typically used in cohort studies, where subjects are followed over time to see if they develop the outcome. Absolute risk is not applicable here as it requires incidence data, which is not available in a case-control study.",9
1369,"The patient is experiencing episodes of involuntary urine leakage when there is increased abdominal pressure, such as during laughing or sneezing, which is characteristic of stress urinary incontinence. This type of incontinence is often due to urethral hypermobility, which is common in multiparous women due to weakening of the pelvic floor muscles. The mention of her mother receiving a ventriculoperitoneal shunt suggests a possible familial history of normal pressure hydrocephalus, but the patient's symptoms and normal gait do not strongly indicate this condition. Therefore, the primary underlying etiology for her urinary incontinence is likely urethral hypermobility.",9
1370,"The patient has Hodgkin’s lymphoma and has been undergoing chemotherapy. The symptoms of dry cough and shortness of breath, along with the CT findings of bilateral diffuse cystic airspaces, suggest a pulmonary issue related to the treatment. The normal FEV1/FVC ratio indicates that this is not an obstructive lung disease, ruling out COPD (option C). The presentation is not consistent with bacterial pneumonia, as the patient is afebrile and the CT findings do not show consolidation typical of pneumonia (option D). Metastatic spread to the lungs is unlikely given the CT findings of cystic airspaces rather than nodules or masses (option B). The most likely cause is drug-induced interstitial lung disease, particularly from bleomycin, a common chemotherapeutic agent used in Hodgkin’s lymphoma, known to cause pulmonary toxicity and cystic changes in the lungs (option A).",9
1372,"The question is asking for a finding that would suggest a malignant diagnosis of a pigmented skin lesion. The ABCDE criteria are commonly used to evaluate pigmented lesions for melanoma: Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variation, Diameter greater than 6 mm, and Evolution over time. 

- Option A: Different pigmentation throughout the lesion suggests color variation, which is a concerning feature for melanoma.
- Option B: A hyperpigmented lesion with smooth borders suggests regular borders, which is less concerning for malignancy.
- Option C: A symmetrical ovoid lesion suggests symmetry, which is less concerning for malignancy.
- Option D: Tenderness to palpation is not a typical feature of melanoma and does not specifically suggest malignancy.

Therefore, the finding that suggests a malignant diagnosis is different pigmentation throughout the lesion, indicating color variation.",9
1374,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of an atrial septal defect (ASD). The wide fixed split S2 and the systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border are classic findings for ASD. The mid-diastolic rumble is due to increased flow across the tricuspid valve. In ASD, there is left-to-right shunting of blood, leading to increased blood flow to the right atrium and right ventricle, causing right ventricular volume overload. This results in increased right ventricular end-diastolic dimension. Therefore, the echocardiogram would likely show increased right ventricular size, not decreased. The correct finding on echocardiogram would be increased right ventricular end-diastolic dimension, but since this option is not available, the closest related finding is the anterior movement of the ventricular septum during systole, which can occur due to right ventricular volume overload.",9
1375,"The symptoms described in the question, such as irritability, poor feeding, stiffness, and muscle spasms in a one-week-old infant, are indicative of neonatal tetanus. Neonatal tetanus occurs when the mother is not immunized against tetanus, and the infant is exposed to the bacteria, often through the umbilical stump. The prevention of neonatal tetanus is primarily through maternal immunization with the tetanus toxoid vaccine during pregnancy, which provides passive immunity to the infant. This is why option B, a toxoid vaccine given to the mother pre-natally, is the correct intervention that could have prevented this disease.",9
1377,"The clinical presentation of eczema, recurrent infections, and thrombocytopenia in a young boy is highly suggestive of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS). WAS is an X-linked recessive condition characterized by the triad of eczema, recurrent infections due to immunodeficiency, and thrombocytopenia with small platelets. The recurrent infections can affect the respiratory tract, skin, and gastrointestinal system, aligning with the symptoms described. 

Severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome (SCID) typically presents with severe infections early in life and does not specifically include thrombocytopenia or eczema as part of its classic presentation.

Chediak-Higashi syndrome is characterized by partial oculocutaneous albinism, recurrent pyogenic infections, and neurological problems, but not thrombocytopenia or eczema.

Hyper-IgE syndrome (Job's syndrome) involves recurrent skin and lung infections, eczema, and elevated IgE levels, but thrombocytopenia is not a feature.

Therefore, the combination of symptoms in this patient is most consistent with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.",9
1379,"Carvedilol is a non-selective beta-blocker with additional alpha-1 blocking activity, which can lead to vasodilation and potentially more pronounced hypotension compared to propranolol, which is a non-selective beta-blocker without alpha-1 blocking effects. Both drugs can cause bradycardia, but this is not more likely with carvedilol compared to propranolol. Hyperglycemia is not a typical side effect of either drug. Bronchospasm is more associated with non-selective beta-blockers like propranolol, especially in patients with asthma or COPD, due to beta-2 receptor blockade. Therefore, the additional alpha-1 blocking effect of carvedilol makes hypotension more likely compared to propranolol.",9
1384,"The patient presents with amenorrhea, obesity, and acanthosis nigricans, which are suggestive of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, the presence of a right-sided adnexal mass on rectal examination requires further evaluation to rule out other pathologies such as an ovarian cyst or tumor. A transvaginal ultrasound is typically the preferred method for evaluating adnexal masses due to its superior resolution. However, in this case, the patient is not sexually active, and the hymen is intact, making a transvaginal ultrasound inappropriate. Therefore, a transabdominal ultrasound is the next best option to assess the adnexal mass. While it may not provide as high a resolution as a transvaginal ultrasound, it is still a useful diagnostic tool in this scenario.",9
1381,"The clinical presentation suggests subacute thyroiditis (de Quervain's thyroiditis), characterized by fever, neck pain, and a tender thyroid gland. The low TSH level indicates hyperthyroidism, likely due to the release of preformed thyroid hormones from the inflamed gland. The elevated ESR supports an inflammatory process. The decreased radioactive iodine uptake is typical of subacute thyroiditis, as the thyroid is not actively producing new hormone. Histologically, subacute thyroiditis is characterized by noncaseating granulomas with multinucleated giant cells.",9
1387,"The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus, as indicated by his elevated HbA1c levels. Lifestyle modifications have led to some improvement, but his HbA1c is still significantly above the target of less than 7%. The first-line pharmacological treatment for type 2 diabetes is metformin, unless contraindicated. Metformin is effective, has a good safety profile, and can help reduce HbA1c by about 1-2%. Since the patient is otherwise healthy and this is the initial pharmacological intervention, starting with metformin alone is appropriate. Combination therapy is typically considered if metformin alone does not achieve glycemic control.",9
1390,"The scenario describes a 15-year-old girl who is experiencing a change in academic performance and has conflicts with her mother. She is adjusting to high school and expresses dissatisfaction with her social group and teachers. She denies substance use, abuse, or self-harm. Her behavior, including arguing with her mother and expressing frustration, can be typical for adolescents undergoing developmental changes and stress from new environments. There is no evidence of persistent defiant behavior, violation of rules, or disregard for others' rights, which would suggest oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder. Antisocial personality disorder is not applicable as it is diagnosed in individuals 18 years or older. Therefore, her behavior is most consistent with normal adolescent development.",9
1395,"The patient is experiencing an acute asthma exacerbation, characterized by bronchoconstriction and airway inflammation, leading to difficulty in air movement. Inspiratory stridor (A) is typically associated with upper airway obstruction, not asthma. Increased breath sounds (B) would not be expected; rather, decreased breath sounds are common due to poor air movement. A friction rub (C) is associated with pleural inflammation, not asthma. Pulsus paradoxus (D) is a drop in blood pressure during inspiration and is commonly seen in severe asthma exacerbations due to increased intrathoracic pressure changes. Therefore, prior to treatment, pulsus paradoxus is the most likely finding.",9
1399,"The patient is showing signs of avoiding the emotional distress associated with his mother's death by quickly changing the subject to something more positive and future-oriented, like baseball tryouts. This indicates a conscious decision to put aside his feelings temporarily to focus on something else, which aligns with suppression. Suppression is a mature defense mechanism where an individual consciously chooses to avoid thinking about distressing thoughts or feelings. In contrast, repression is an unconscious process, denial involves refusing to accept reality, and displacement involves redirecting emotions to a safer outlet.",9
1401,"The patient has peripheral artery disease (PAD) with symptoms of intermittent claudication, as indicated by the calf cramping with walking and an ABI of 0.70. Initial management includes lifestyle modifications, a supervised exercise program, and medications like aspirin and cilostazol. If there is no improvement after these interventions, the next step is typically revascularization. This can involve procedures such as angioplasty or bypass surgery to improve blood flow. Heparin is not indicated for chronic PAD management, amputation is considered only in severe cases with tissue loss or infection, and surgical decompression is not relevant for PAD.",9
1402,"The patient presents with signs of cardiogenic shock following a recent myocardial infarction, with a pronounced holosystolic murmur and a significant pericardial effusion on echocardiography. These findings suggest the possibility of a mechanical complication such as ventricular free wall rupture leading to cardiac tamponade. The presence of ST elevations and low-voltage QRS complexes further supports this diagnosis. In this scenario, immediate surgical intervention is necessary to address the mechanical complication. Therefore, the next best step in management is to transfer the patient to the operating room for surgical repair.",9
1403,"The clinical presentation and x-ray findings suggest Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease, which is avascular necrosis of the femoral head in children. The boy has a history of thigh pain, an antalgic gait, and limited hip movement, which are consistent with this condition. The x-ray shows a smaller left femoral epiphysis and widening of the medial joint space, indicating early stages of the disease without significant femoral head damage. In early stages, the goal is to maintain the femoral head within the acetabulum and preserve hip motion. Conservative management, such as limited weight bearing and physical therapy, is appropriate to reduce stress on the joint and promote healing. More invasive interventions like femoral head pinning are reserved for more severe cases or when conservative measures fail.",9
1404,"The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and hypertension. His LDL cholesterol is 85 mg/dL, which is below the target of less than 100 mg/dL for diabetic patients, but current guidelines recommend statin therapy for diabetic patients over 40 years old regardless of LDL levels due to their increased cardiovascular risk. His blood pressure and blood glucose are well controlled, and there is no indication to change his current antihypertensive or diabetic medications. Therefore, the most appropriate recommendation is to begin statin therapy to further reduce cardiovascular risk.",9
1407,"The patient's symptoms and history provide important clues. He has a rash that started on the ankle and moved up the calf, which is itchy and mildly painful. The recent travel to Nigeria is a significant detail. Cutaneous larva migrans is a skin condition caused by the larvae of hookworms, often acquired in tropical regions like Nigeria. It presents as a serpiginous, itchy rash that migrates, which fits the description of the rash moving up the leg. Contact dermatitis would typically be localized to the area of contact and not migrate. Tinea (fungal infection) usually presents as a ring-shaped, scaly rash and is not migratory. Superficial thrombophlebitis would present with a tender, cord-like vein and is not typically itchy or migratory. Therefore, the most likely cause of the symptoms, considering the travel history and rash characteristics, is cutaneous larva migrans.",9
1410,"The patient's symptoms of headache and worsening vision, along with the laboratory findings, suggest a hematological disorder. The key laboratory finding is the increased concentration of a pentameric immunoglobulin, which is indicative of IgM. This is characteristic of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, a condition associated with monoclonal IgM gammopathy. The symptoms can be explained by hyperviscosity syndrome, which is common in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia due to the high levels of IgM. Multiple myeloma typically involves IgG or IgA, not IgM. Hyper IgM syndrome is a genetic disorder affecting immunoglobulin class switching, not typically presenting in this manner. Giant cell arteritis would not show these laboratory findings and is more associated with elevated inflammatory markers and temporal artery involvement.",9
1413,"The patient's inability to dorsiflex the left foot suggests a problem with the common peroneal nerve, which innervates the muscles responsible for dorsiflexion. The common peroneal nerve is susceptible to injury at the fibular neck, where it wraps around the bone. A fibular neck fracture could damage this nerve, leading to foot drop (inability to dorsiflex). The other options are less likely to cause isolated dorsiflexion weakness. A calcaneal fracture would affect the heel and is more associated with issues in plantarflexion. A Lisfranc fracture involves the midfoot and would not typically cause isolated dorsiflexion weakness. A tibial plateau fracture affects the knee area and is less likely to impact the common peroneal nerve directly.",9
1420,"The clinical presentation and ultrasound findings suggest a thyroid nodule with suspicious features. The FNAC indicates a follicular neoplasm, which could be either a follicular adenoma or carcinoma. The key histopathological feature that differentiates follicular carcinoma from follicular adenoma is the presence of capsular and/or vascular invasion. 

- Option A (Psammoma bodies) is associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma, not follicular carcinoma.
- Option B describes a follicular adenoma, which lacks capsular or vascular invasion.
- Option C describes follicular carcinoma, characterized by capsular and vascular invasion.
- Option D (Hyperplastic parafollicular C cells) is related to medullary thyroid carcinoma.

Therefore, the presence of capsular and vascular invasion is diagnostic of follicular carcinoma.",9
1424,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with infective endocarditis, including fever, a new diastolic murmur, and systemic symptoms. He recently had a prosthetic valve replacement, which increases the risk of prosthetic valve endocarditis. The timing of the symptoms (5 weeks post-surgery) suggests early prosthetic valve endocarditis. The most common organisms causing early prosthetic valve endocarditis (within 60 days of surgery) are Staphylococcus epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci, due to their ability to form biofilms on prosthetic material. Streptococcus gallolyticus is associated with colon cancer and typically causes native valve endocarditis. Viridans streptococci are more common in late prosthetic valve endocarditis and native valve endocarditis following dental procedures. Streptococcus pyogenes is not commonly associated with endocarditis.",9
1421,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of Turner syndrome, characterized by primary amenorrhea, short stature, and distinctive physical features such as a broad chest with widely spaced nipples, high-arched palate, and a low posterior hairline. The elevated blood pressure could indicate coarctation of the aorta, which is common in Turner syndrome. Patients with Turner syndrome often have streak ovaries leading to estrogen deficiency, which increases the risk of osteoporosis and pathologic fractures. Therefore, without appropriate treatment, such as estrogen replacement therapy, this patient is at the greatest risk of developing pathologic fractures due to osteoporosis.",9
1423,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of infective endocarditis, particularly given his history of intravenous drug use, fever, and a new systolic murmur. In such cases, the next best step in management is to obtain blood cultures to identify the causative organism before starting antibiotic therapy. This is crucial because it guides appropriate antibiotic selection and ensures effective treatment. While starting empirical antibiotics is important, it should ideally be done after obtaining blood cultures to avoid compromising the ability to identify the pathogen.",9
1429,"The physician is faced with a conflict between personal religious beliefs and professional responsibilities. The most appropriate response is to respect the patient's autonomy and provide her with access to the requested medical care, even if the physician cannot personally provide it due to religious beliefs. Referring the patient to another provider who can fulfill her request ensures that her healthcare needs are met without compromising the physician's beliefs. This approach respects both the patient's rights and the physician's beliefs.",9
1428,"The patient has hypertension and dyslipidemia, as indicated by his elevated total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, along with low HDL cholesterol. The primary goal in managing dyslipidemia is to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, especially given his family history of heart disease. Statins, such as atorvastatin, are the first-line treatment for lowering LDL cholesterol and reducing cardiovascular risk. Niacin and gemfibrozil are not first-line treatments for this patient's lipid profile, and orlistat is used for weight loss, which is not the primary concern here. Therefore, atorvastatin should be added to address his dyslipidemia and reduce cardiovascular risk.",9
1437,"The condition described is likely G6PD deficiency, which is an X-linked recessive disorder. The woman's brother and maternal uncle are affected, suggesting that the woman's mother is a carrier. Since the woman is the sister of an affected male, she has a 50% chance of being a carrier herself. If she is a carrier, there is a 50% chance she will pass the affected X chromosome to her son, who would then be affected. Therefore, the probability that her son will be affected is 50% (chance she is a carrier) x 50% (chance she passes the affected X chromosome) = 25%.",9
1438,"The patient presents with altered mental status, fruity breath odor, and signs of dehydration (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension, tachycardia). She has a history of diabetes and is on insulin therapy. The fruity breath odor suggests the presence of ketones, which is indicative of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is characterized by an anion-gap metabolic acidosis due to the accumulation of ketone bodies. Additionally, the patient is tachypneic (respiratory rate of 30/min), which suggests a compensatory respiratory alkalosis as the body attempts to blow off CO2 to compensate for the metabolic acidosis. Therefore, the most likely acid-base disturbance in this patient is a combination of respiratory alkalosis and anion-gap metabolic acidosis.",9
1431,"The patient presents with sudden onset palpitations and a heart rate of 155/min, suggesting a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The lack of response to vagal maneuvers (forceful exhalation against a closed glottis) indicates that pharmacological intervention is needed. Adenosine is the first-line treatment for acute termination of SVT due to its ability to transiently block AV node conduction, which can interrupt the reentrant circuit causing the tachycardia. Verapamil and diltiazem are calcium channel blockers that can also be used for rate control in SVT, but adenosine is preferred for its rapid action and short half-life. Electrical cardioversion is reserved for hemodynamically unstable patients, which this patient is not. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to administer adenosine intravenously.",9
1433,"The patient presents with features suggestive of metabolic syndrome, including hypertension, obesity, elevated fasting glucose, low HDL, and high triglycerides. These features are commonly associated with insulin resistance, which is a key component of metabolic syndrome. Insulin resistance occurs when cells in the body become less responsive to insulin, leading to higher blood glucose levels and dyslipidemia. This is consistent with the patient's elevated fasting glucose and lipid profile. Autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells (option A) is associated with type 1 diabetes, which does not fit this patient's profile. LDL receptor gene mutation (option C) is related to familial hypercholesterolemia, which would primarily affect LDL levels, not the broader metabolic syndrome picture. Excessive cortisol secretion (option D) is related to Cushing's syndrome, which is not indicated here. Therefore, the most likely mechanism contributing to this patient's condition is insulin receptor resistance.",9
1434,"The patient presents with a triad of symptoms: memory problems, urinary incontinence, and gait disturbance. These symptoms are characteristic of normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). The gait disturbance described as slow, with small steps and a wide base, is typical of NPH. The CT scan would likely show ventriculomegaly without significant cortical atrophy, which is consistent with NPH. The absence of extraocular movement abnormalities and normal muscle tone and strength help rule out progressive supranuclear palsy and Parkinson’s disease. Early-onset Alzheimer’s disease typically presents with memory impairment but not with the triad seen here. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is normal-pressure hydrocephalus.",9
1443,"The patient experienced a seizure, likely due to severe hyponatremia, as indicated by the serum sodium level of 115 mEq/L. Hyponatremia can cause neurological symptoms, including seizures. The immediate treatment for symptomatic hyponatremia, especially when seizures are present, is the administration of hypertonic saline to rapidly increase the sodium level and reduce cerebral edema. Antiepileptic drugs like phenytoin or valproic acid are not indicated first because the seizure is likely due to the electrolyte imbalance rather than a primary seizure disorder. Diazepam could be used to stop an ongoing seizure, but since the patient is no longer seizing, the priority is to correct the underlying cause, which is the hyponatremia.",9
1444,"The patient presents with signs of a severe soft tissue infection, likely necrotizing fasciitis, given the purplish discoloration, severe pain, and crepitus (crackling sounds) near the surgical incision. This condition is a surgical emergency. The most critical step in management is to perform surgical debridement to remove necrotic tissue and control the spread of infection. While antibiotics such as clindamycin are important, they are not sufficient alone to manage necrotizing fasciitis. Imaging studies or wound closure devices are not appropriate initial steps in this acute setting.",9
1445,"The child presents with symptoms consistent with acute otitis media (AOM), including fever, ear pain, and a bulging tympanic membrane. The history of atopic dermatitis and recent swimming could suggest otitis externa, but the bulging tympanic membrane is more indicative of AOM. Given the child's history of urticaria with antibiotics, there is a concern for potential allergy, possibly to penicillin. However, azithromycin is a macrolide and is often used in cases of penicillin allergy. Topical treatments like hydrocortisone and gentamicin are more appropriate for otitis externa, not AOM. Otic ofloxacin is also used for otitis externa or tympanostomy tube otorrhea, not AOM. Tympanocentesis is typically reserved for severe cases or treatment failures. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is oral azithromycin, considering the potential antibiotic allergy and the diagnosis of AOM.",9
1448,"To determine how long it will take for vancomycin to reach 94% of its steady state concentration, we need to understand the concept of half-lives in pharmacokinetics. For a drug eliminated by first-order kinetics, it takes about 4 to 5 half-lives to reach steady state. Specifically, 94% of steady state is reached after approximately 4 half-lives.

Given that the half-life of vancomycin is 6 hours, we can calculate the time to reach 94% of steady state as follows:

Time to reach 94% steady state = 4 half-lives = 4 x 6 hours = 24 hours.

Therefore, it will take 24 hours for vancomycin to reach 94% of its plasma steady state concentration.",9
1450,"The patient presents with epistaxis (nosebleed) that is not controlled by direct pressure. Given her history of hypertension and current elevated blood pressure, it's important to manage the bleeding effectively. The bleeding is likely from the anterior part of the nasal septum, which is the most common site for epistaxis. Initial management typically involves conservative measures such as direct pressure and topical vasoconstrictors. Since direct pressure was ineffective, the next step is to use a topical vasoconstrictor like oxymetazoline, which can help constrict the blood vessels and reduce bleeding. Anterior nasal packing and cauterization are options if vasoconstrictors fail. Intravenous nitroglycerin is not appropriate for managing epistaxis.",9
1455,"The patient presents with lower abdominal pain, inability to urinate, and a palpable tender abdominal mass, which is likely a distended bladder due to urinary retention. The use of amitriptyline, an anticholinergic, can cause urinary retention, especially in a patient with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The ultrasound shows an anechoic mass, consistent with a full bladder. The most appropriate immediate management for acute urinary retention is bladder decompression via transurethral catheterization.",9
1465,"The patient presents with leukocytosis (65,000/mm3) and thrombocytosis (500,000/mm3), which are suggestive of a myeloproliferative disorder. Given the history of cervical cancer treated with radiotherapy, there is a possibility of secondary malignancy or a primary hematologic disorder. The normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and anemia (hemoglobin 10 g/dL) are also noted. The most likely diagnosis is chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), especially considering the high leukocyte count. The first-line treatment for CML is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, such as dasatinib, which targets the BCR-ABL fusion protein characteristic of CML. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to start dasatinib.",9
1466,"The lateral corticospinal tract is responsible for carrying motor signals from the brain to the body, specifically for voluntary motor control of the limbs. It is a descending tract that crosses over (decussates) at the medullary pyramids, meaning that the right lateral corticospinal tract controls the right side of the body. Damage to the right lateral corticospinal tract at the level of T1 would result in motor deficits on the same side of the body below the level of the lesion. Therefore, the patient would experience an absence of right-sided motor function below T1.",9
1473,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of biliary colic or acute cholecystitis, such as right upper quadrant pain, nausea, and vomiting. The presence of scleral icterus and elevated bilirubin levels, particularly direct bilirubin, suggests possible biliary obstruction or choledocholithiasis (common bile duct stones). The elevated alkaline phosphatase and mild elevation in AST also support this. The most appropriate initial imaging study to evaluate the biliary tree and gallbladder is a transabdominal ultrasound. This can identify gallstones, biliary duct dilation, and other abnormalities. CT scan is less sensitive for gallstones, ERCP is more invasive and typically used for therapeutic purposes, and a HIDA scan is more specific for acute cholecystitis diagnosis rather than choledocholithiasis.",9
1459,"The patient's history and imaging findings are suggestive of asbestosis, a condition caused by asbestos exposure. He has worked in a naval shipyard, which is a known risk factor for asbestos exposure. The CT findings of pleural plaques and subpleural linear opacities further support this diagnosis. Asbestosis is associated with an increased risk of both bronchogenic carcinoma and malignant mesothelioma. However, bronchogenic carcinoma is more common than malignant mesothelioma in patients with asbestosis. While malignant mesothelioma is a classic association with asbestos exposure, the overall incidence of bronchogenic carcinoma is higher in these patients, especially given the patient's significant smoking history, which further increases the risk of bronchogenic carcinoma.",9
1479,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings are consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient has hyperglycemia (glucose 570 mg/dL), metabolic acidosis (pH 7.25, HCO3- 16 mEq/L), and ketonemia (positive ketones). The initial management of DKA involves correcting dehydration, hyperglycemia, and electrolyte imbalances. The first step is to provide intravenous hydration to restore circulatory volume and improve renal perfusion. The standard initial fluid is 0.9% normal saline. Insulin therapy is also crucial to reduce blood glucose levels and resolve ketosis. Potassium levels need to be monitored and replaced as needed, but the immediate priority is fluid resuscitation and insulin administration. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is intravenous hydration with 0.9% normal saline and insulin.",9
1477,"The patient presents with signs of coagulopathy, including a large hematoma and numerous bruises, along with an elevated prothrombin time (PT). The normal bleeding time and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) suggest a defect in the extrinsic pathway, which is primarily dependent on factor VII. The patient's history of alcohol use and the presence of spider angiomas suggest possible liver dysfunction, which can lead to impaired synthesis of clotting factors, including factor VII. Factor VII has the shortest half-life among the vitamin K-dependent factors, and its deficiency would primarily prolong the PT. This is consistent with impaired activation of factor VII due to liver dysfunction or vitamin K deficiency, which is common in patients with liver disease or those who are not eating well, as in this case with bowel rest.",9
1482,"The patient presents with flaccid blisters on the skin and mucosal involvement, including oral and vulvar ulcers. The presence of flaccid blisters and positive Nikolsky sign (epidermis separates when stroked) suggests an intraepidermal blistering disorder. Pemphigus vulgaris is characterized by autoantibodies against desmogleins, which are components of desmosomes that hold keratinocytes together, leading to acantholysis and intraepidermal blistering. This condition often involves mucosal surfaces, which aligns with the patient's symptoms. In contrast, bullous pemphigoid typically presents with tense blisters and less mucosal involvement, and dermatitis herpetiformis is associated with gluten sensitivity and presents with grouped vesicles, often on extensor surfaces. Lichen planus presents with pruritic, purple, polygonal papules and plaques, not blisters. Therefore, the clinical presentation is most consistent with pemphigus vulgaris.",9
1484,"The key details in the question are that the virus can replicate in denucleated cells, its proteins are directly translated from the virion's genetic material, and large polypeptides are cleaved by viral proteases. This suggests that the virus has a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome, as these can be directly translated into proteins by host ribosomes. Additionally, the replication of the viral genome using a protein translated from the virion's genetic material is characteristic of RNA viruses. Among the options, Coxsackievirus is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that fits this description. Parvovirus is a single-stranded DNA virus, Molluscum contagiosum virus is a DNA virus, and Measles virus is a negative-sense RNA virus, which requires transcription into positive-sense RNA before translation.",9
1486,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), likely chronic bronchitis given the cyanosis, productive cough, and peripheral edema. Chronic bronchitis is characterized by increased bronchial markings on chest radiograph due to inflammation and mucus production in the airways. Cardiomegaly may also be present due to cor pulmonale, a complication of chronic bronchitis where the right side of the heart enlarges due to increased resistance in the pulmonary circulation. The patient's smoking history and symptoms align with this diagnosis. Hyperinflated lungs and loss of lung markings are more characteristic of emphysema, another form of COPD, but the clinical picture here is more consistent with chronic bronchitis.",9
1492,"The patient's symptoms and biopsy results are indicative of leprosy (Hansen's disease), which is caused by Mycobacterium leprae. The key features include poorly demarcated skin lesions, facial thickening, eyebrow loss, symmetrical sensory neuropathy, and weakness in the hands. The presence of acid-fast bacilli in the skin biopsy confirms the diagnosis. The standard treatment for leprosy involves a multi-drug regimen, which includes dapsone, rifampicin, and clofazimine. Among the options provided, dapsone is the drug specifically used in the treatment of leprosy.",10
1493,"The patient is a 16-year-old girl with dysmenorrhea that has become unresponsive to NSAIDs. Her symptoms are consistent with primary dysmenorrhea, which is common in adolescents and is due to increased prostaglandin production during menstruation. The first-line treatment is NSAIDs, but since they are no longer effective, the next step is to consider hormonal therapy. Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are effective in reducing menstrual pain by suppressing ovulation and reducing prostaglandin levels. There is no indication of infection or structural abnormalities that would necessitate options like antibiotics or diagnostic laparoscopy. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to start oral contraceptive pills.",9
1496,"The clinical presentation suggests a case of child abuse, specifically immersion burns. The sharply delineated erythema on the lower extremities up to the umbilicus with sparing of the knees and flexor surfaces is characteristic of a ""stocking-glove"" distribution, often seen in immersion burns. The social history, including the mother's recent job loss and history of depression, adds to the suspicion of neglect or abuse. In cases of child abuse, further evaluation often reveals multiple injuries in different stages of healing, which is consistent with repeated trauma over time.",9
1498,"Mifepristone is a medication used to terminate early pregnancies. It works primarily by blocking the progesterone receptor. Progesterone is essential for maintaining the uterine lining and supporting early pregnancy. By blocking this hormone, mifepristone causes the uterine lining to break down, leading to the detachment of the pregnancy. This action is often followed by the administration of a prostaglandin, such as misoprostol, to induce uterine contractions and complete the abortion process. The other options listed do not describe the primary mechanism of mifepristone. Inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase is the mechanism of methotrexate, activation of prostaglandin E1 receptors is related to misoprostol, and oxytocin receptor agonism is related to oxytocin itself.",9
1503,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with median nerve compression, such as numbness in the lateral three digits and inability to flex the lateral two digits when making a fist. Tinel's sign is positive, indicating irritation of the median nerve. These symptoms are often associated with carpal tunnel syndrome, but given the acute nature of the injury following a fall, a structural injury is more likely. A lunate dislocation can cause acute carpal tunnel syndrome by compressing the median nerve. The other options are less likely to cause these specific symptoms. A fracture of the distal radius typically does not cause isolated median nerve symptoms. A palmar aponeurosis tear and interosseous ligament rupture are not typically associated with median nerve compression.",9
1509,"The patient is pregnant and presents with symptoms suggestive of hyperthyroidism, such as palpitations, diarrhea, and tachycardia. Her TSH is low, and total T4 is slightly elevated. In pregnancy, total T4 can be elevated due to increased thyroid-binding globulin, so free T4 is a more accurate measure of thyroid function. To assess whether the patient has true hyperthyroidism, measuring free T4 levels would be most useful. This will help determine if the elevated total T4 is due to increased binding proteins or actual hyperthyroidism.",9
1510,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest a diagnosis of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), likely due to adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency. The key findings supporting this are the recurrent infections, absence of tonsils, absent thymic shadow, and increased deoxyadenosine levels. ADA deficiency leads to toxic accumulation of metabolites that are particularly harmful to lymphocytes, resulting in a marked decrease in both T and B cells. The absence of a thymic shadow and recurrent infections indicate a profound T-cell deficiency. Therefore, the most likely additional finding in this patient is decreased circulating T cells.",9
1449,"The patient's symptoms are suggestive of performance anxiety or a social anxiety disorder, particularly relating to situations like presentations, and he also exhibits generalized anxiety regarding his relationship and academic performance. Despite his anxiety, his vital signs are stable, and his physical examination is normal.

When managing anxiety disorders, the best initial approach involves non-pharmacological interventions. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the first-line treatment for anxiety disorders, including social anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. CBT helps patients identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors associated with their anxiety.

Pharmacologic treatments such as SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine) may be considered, but therapy is usually recommended initially unless symptoms are severe.

Propranolol is used for performance anxiety but only helps with physiological symptoms and not the long-term management of anxiety.

Alprazolam is not the best choice due to its potential for dependence and is not the initial treatment for situational anxiety.

Therefore, cognitive behavioral therapy is the best initial step in management.",9
1515,"The patient is a 30-year-old African-American woman with a history of smoking and a family history of progressive lung disease. She is asymptomatic, and her examination and laboratory studies are normal. The chest x-ray is not described, but given the context, it may show findings suggestive of sarcoidosis, such as bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. Sarcoidosis is more common in African-American women and can be asymptomatic. The most appropriate management for asymptomatic sarcoidosis with no significant organ involvement is observation or monitoring, as many cases resolve spontaneously without treatment. There is no indication for ANCA testing, methotrexate therapy, or isoniazid monotherapy based on the information provided.",9
1512,"The patient presents with a triad of symptoms: gait disturbance, cognitive impairment, and urinary incontinence. These symptoms are characteristic of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). In NPH, there is an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain's ventricles, leading to increased pressure that affects brain function. The underlying cause of NPH is typically decreased absorption of CSF by the arachnoid granulations, rather than obstruction of CSF flow. This results in the ventricles enlarging and causing the symptoms observed. The MRI would likely show enlarged ventricles consistent with this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is decreased CSF absorption.",9
1518,"The patient's symptoms and recent travel history are suggestive of coccidioidomycosis, also known as Valley Fever, which is endemic to areas like Southern California. The symptoms include fever, joint pain, cough, chest pain, and erythema nodosum (painful red rash on the legs). In coccidioidomycosis, the lung biopsy would typically show spherules filled with endospores, which is characteristic of Coccidioides immitis infection.",9
1520,"The patient has estrogen- and progesterone receptor-positive breast cancer, which means her cancer growth is driven by these hormones. She is postmenopausal, as indicated by her last menstrual period being 10 years ago. In postmenopausal women, the primary source of estrogen is the peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogen by the enzyme aromatase. Aromatase inhibitors are commonly used in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer to reduce estrogen levels and slow cancer growth. The mechanism of action of aromatase inhibitors is to inhibit the peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogen. This aligns with the patient's preference to avoid chemotherapy, as aromatase inhibitors are an oral medication with a different side effect profile than chemotherapy.",9
1524,"The patient has resistant hypertension, which is hypertension that remains uncontrolled despite the use of three antihypertensive agents of different classes. The presence of abdominal bruits suggests renal artery stenosis, a common cause of secondary hypertension. In such cases, imaging to evaluate the renal arteries is warranted. A renal ultrasound with Doppler is a non-invasive test that can assess blood flow in the renal arteries and is often used as an initial test for renal artery stenosis. CT abdomen/pelvis is more invasive and involves radiation and contrast, which may not be ideal given the patient's diabetes. Increasing the dose of current medications is unlikely to address the underlying cause if renal artery stenosis is present. Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, could be beneficial, but confirming the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis is a priority before adjusting medications further.",9
1526,"In this scenario, the physician's personal beliefs conflict with the patient's request for oral contraceptives. While the physician is not obligated to prescribe medication that conflicts with their personal beliefs, they do have a professional responsibility to ensure the patient receives appropriate care. This includes referring the patient to another provider who can fulfill the request. Therefore, the most appropriate response is to explain to the patient that they will be referred to another provider who can prescribe the oral contraceptive. This respects both the physician's beliefs and the patient's autonomy and access to care.",9
1539,"The symptoms and imaging findings suggest a craniopharyngioma, which is a tumor that commonly presents in children with symptoms like headaches, visual field defects (often bitemporal hemianopsia), and growth retardation due to pituitary involvement. The imaging shows a cystic calcified mass above the sella turcica, which is characteristic of craniopharyngiomas. These tumors are derived from remnants of Rathke's pouch, which is an embryonic precursor to the anterior pituitary gland. Rathke's pouch is derived from oral ectoderm.",9
1538,"Collagen synthesis involves several steps, some of which occur intracellularly and others extracellularly. The translation of pro-α chains (D) occurs in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Glycosylation of pro-α chains (A) also occurs in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Triple-helix formation (C) occurs within the cell, specifically in the endoplasmic reticulum. The cleavage of procollagen C- and N-terminals (B) occurs extracellularly, where procollagen is converted into tropocollagen by specific enzymes, allowing collagen fibrils to form.",9
1532,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of Parkinson's disease or a Parkinsonian syndrome. These include disorganized speech, inattentiveness, hand tremors, and a slow, unstable gait. The recent onset of cognitive and motor symptoms, along with the emotional stress from her husband's death, might have exacerbated her condition. 

The medications listed are used for different conditions:

- **Bromocriptine** is a dopamine agonist used in Parkinson's disease.
- **Reserpine** is an antihypertensive that depletes monoamines and is not used for Parkinson's.
- **Rivastigmine** is a cholinesterase inhibitor used for Alzheimer's disease and dementia associated with Parkinson's.
- **Selegiline** is a monoamine oxidase B inhibitor used in Parkinson's disease.

Given the symptoms of tremor, gait instability, and cognitive changes, the most appropriate medication to address both cognitive and motor symptoms in a Parkinsonian syndrome is **Rivastigmine**. It is particularly beneficial if there is a component of dementia with Parkinson's disease.",9
1543,"The patient has a 2 cm pulmonary nodule with poorly defined margins and dense, irregular calcification. Given her smoking history and the characteristics of the nodule, there is a concern for malignancy. However, the presence of calcification, especially if dense and irregular, can sometimes suggest a benign process, such as a granuloma. The most appropriate initial step in evaluating a pulmonary nodule is to compare it with any previous imaging to assess for changes in size or appearance over time. This can help determine the growth rate and potential malignancy risk. Therefore, obtaining previous chest radiographs for comparison is the most appropriate next step.",9
1540,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with intermittent claudication, which is characterized by crampy leg pain that occurs with exertion and is relieved by rest. This is typically due to peripheral artery disease (PAD), often caused by atherosclerosis. The risk factors for atherosclerosis include diabetes mellitus, smoking, and hypertension, all of which are present in this patient. The physical examination finding of dry and hairless skin over the left foot suggests poor arterial blood supply. The most common cause of PAD is atherosclerotic plaque formation in the arteries supplying the lower extremities. In this case, the intimal plaque in the posterior tibial artery is the most likely cause of the symptoms, as it would lead to reduced blood flow during exertion, causing the pain.",9
1542,"The clinical presentation suggests a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), particularly one with absent T-cells. The autosomal recessive form of SCID is often due to adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency. ADA deficiency leads to the accumulation of toxic metabolites such as deoxyadenosine, which is toxic to lymphocytes and results in the absence of T-cells, B-cells, and NK cells. This matches the description of the patient's condition. Other options do not fit the autosomal recessive pattern or the specific immunodeficiency described: dysfunctional cell chemotaxis is associated with leukocyte adhesion deficiency, a negative nitroblue-tetrazolium test is associated with chronic granulomatous disease, and nonfunctional common gamma chain is associated with X-linked SCID.",9

1548,"The child has sickle cell anemia and presents with acute swelling and pain in the hand, which is likely due to a vaso-occlusive crisis, commonly known as dactylitis or hand-foot syndrome in young children with sickle cell disease. The best initial management for a vaso-occlusive crisis is pain control. Intravenous morphine is appropriate for severe pain management in this scenario. Joint aspiration and MRI are not indicated as initial steps in this case, and incentive spirometry is used for preventing acute chest syndrome, not for managing dactylitis.",9
1546,"The patient presents with a Trendelenburg gait, which is characterized by the hip dropping on the side opposite to the affected gluteus medius and minimus muscles. This suggests an injury to the superior gluteal nerve, which innervates these muscles. The superior gluteal nerve is at risk of injury when an intramuscular injection is given in the superomedial quadrant of the buttock. This area is close to the sciatic nerve and the superior gluteal nerve, making it a dangerous site for injections. The safe area for intramuscular injections in the buttock is the superolateral quadrant, which avoids these nerves. Therefore, the likely site of the injection that caused the nerve injury is the superomedial quadrant of the buttock.",9
1553,"The patient presents with sudden vision loss in the right eye and progressive central vision loss over the past year, along with findings of subretinal fluid, hemorrhage, and grayish-green discoloration in the macular area. These findings are consistent with wet (neovascular) age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The presence of drusen and retinal pigment epithelial changes in the left eye suggests dry AMD in that eye. The most appropriate initial treatment for wet AMD is the use of anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) agents, such as ranibizumab, which help reduce neovascularization and fluid accumulation. Other options like thermal laser photocoagulation are not typically used as initial treatments for wet AMD due to the risk of damaging the retina. Etanercept is not used for AMD, and macular translocation surgery is not a first-line treatment.",9
1556,"The patient has bilateral hydronephrosis, as indicated by the dilatation of the renal pelvis and proximal ureters. This condition is often caused by obstruction of urine flow, leading to increased pressure in the urinary tract. In this case, the numerous intra-abdominal adhesions likely cause ureteral obstruction, leading to increased hydrostatic pressure in the renal tubules. This increased pressure opposes the normal filtration pressure in the glomeruli, reducing the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and causing renal dysfunction, as evidenced by the elevated serum creatinine level.",9
1559,"The patient is experiencing a miscarriage, as indicated by the open cervical os, passage of blood clots, and an empty gestational sac on ultrasound. Given her concern about invasive procedures, expectant management is a reasonable option. This approach involves waiting for the body to naturally expel the remaining products of conception. Methotrexate is not appropriate as it is used for ectopic pregnancies. Serial beta-hCG measurements are not a management strategy but rather a monitoring tool. Oxytocin is used to induce labor or control postpartum hemorrhage, not for managing a miscarriage at this stage. Therefore, expectant management aligns with the patient's preference to avoid invasive procedures.",9
1558,"The patient presents with hyponatremia (serum Na+ 120 mEq/L) and low serum osmolality (250 mOsm/kg), indicating hypotonic hyponatremia. Her urine osmolality is also low (105 mOsm/kg), which suggests that the kidneys are excreting dilute urine. This is consistent with a condition where there is an excess of water relative to sodium, such as primary polydipsia or reset osmostat. However, given her medication history, carbamazepine is known to cause SIADH, which typically presents with euvolemic hyponatremia and concentrated urine. The low urine osmolality here is atypical for SIADH, suggesting a different mechanism. The most likely cause of her hyponatremia is the use of diuretics or adrenal insufficiency, but her normal potassium level and normal blood pressure make these less likely. The most appropriate initial management for hypotonic hyponatremia with low urine osmolality is fluid restriction to prevent further dilution of serum sodium.",9
1545,"The scenario describes a patient who has suffered a massive intracerebral hemorrhage with signs of severe brain injury, including decerebrate posturing and non-reactive pupils. The patient is suspected to be brain dead. To confirm brain death, specific clinical criteria and tests are used. An apnea test, which assesses the absence of spontaneous breathing in response to elevated CO2 levels, is commonly used. However, the options provided do not include an apnea test. 

- Option A (pulse oximetry) is not relevant for confirming brain death.
- Option B (lumbar puncture and CSF culture) is used for diagnosing infections, not brain death.
- Option C (electromyography with nerve conduction studies) assesses peripheral nerve and muscle function, not brain death.
- Option D (CT scan) can show structural damage but does not confirm brain death.

None of the options directly confirm brain death, but CT scan (Option D) is the most relevant in terms of assessing the extent of brain injury. However, legally removing a patient from a ventilator requires clinical confirmation of brain death, typically involving clinical examination and possibly ancillary tests like EEG or cerebral blood flow studies, not a CT scan. Given the options, CT scan is the closest to providing information on brain injury, but it does not confirm brain death by itself.",9
1561,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a hematological malignancy. The presence of fatigue, pallor, petechiae, and splenomegaly, along with the laboratory findings of anemia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia, indicate a possible leukemia. The peripheral blood smear shows immature cells with large, prominent nucleoli and pink, elongated, needle-shaped cytoplasmic inclusions, which are indicative of Auer rods. Auer rods are characteristic of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The high leukocyte count and the presence of immature cells further support the diagnosis of AML. Myelodysplastic syndrome typically presents with cytopenias and dysplastic changes but not with such high leukocyte counts or Auer rods. Chronic myelogenous leukemia is associated with the Philadelphia chromosome and typically presents with a different blood smear appearance. Hairy cell leukemia is characterized by the presence of 'hairy' cells on the smear, not Auer rods.",9
1560,"The study involves comparing the maximum load before failure of tendons repaired using three different suture techniques. Since there are more than two groups being compared (three suture techniques), the appropriate statistical test to use is one that can handle multiple groups. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is specifically designed to compare the means of three or more independent groups to see if there is a statistically significant difference among them. The other options are not suitable: the Chi-squared test is used for categorical data, the Student t-test is used for comparing the means of two groups, and the Wilcoxon rank sum test is a non-parametric test for two groups. Therefore, ANOVA is the correct choice for this scenario.",9
1568,"The patient presents with fever, chest pain, erythema around the sternal wound, and imaging findings suggestive of a mediastinal infection following recent cardiac surgery. The widened mediastinum and fluid collection below the sternum on CT are indicative of a possible mediastinitis, a serious postoperative complication. The presence of stranding in the subcutaneous tissue further supports this diagnosis. In such cases, the best management involves both addressing the infection and removing any infected or necrotic tissue. Therefore, the appropriate next step is to administer intravenous antibiotics to treat the infection and perform surgical debridement to remove the infected tissue and prevent further complications.",9
1567,"The patient's symptoms and findings suggest a systemic condition affecting the lungs and lymph nodes. The dry cough, shortness of breath, and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy on chest x-ray are classic signs of sarcoidosis, a condition characterized by granulomatous inflammation. The hypercalcemia (elevated serum calcium) is also consistent with sarcoidosis, as granulomas can produce calcitriol, leading to increased calcium absorption. The presence of nontender lymphadenopathy and crackles further supports this diagnosis. Neoplastic transformation and viral infection are less likely given the presentation and findings. Air trapping is not consistent with the x-ray findings of reticular opacities and lymphadenopathy. Therefore, the most likely cause of these findings is granulomatous inflammation.",9
1572,"In a retrospective case-control study, participants are asked to recall past exposures. This can lead to recall bias, especially if cases (those with mesothelioma) are more likely to remember or report exposure to industrial grade fiberglass compared to controls. Interviewer bias is less likely because interviewers are blinded, and observer bias is not relevant here as it pertains to the interpretation of results rather than data collection. Lead-time bias is related to early detection in screening studies, not applicable in this context.",9
1569,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a case of uterine prolapse, as indicated by the descent of the cervix to the level of the introitus and the elicitation of uterine procidentia during a Valsalva maneuver. The recurrent urinary symptoms, such as difficulty urinating, along with the back pain and perineal discomfort, are consistent with complications arising from pelvic organ prolapse. The bilateral costovertebral angle tenderness and recurrent low-grade fevers suggest a possible urinary tract obstruction or infection. In cases of significant uterine prolapse, the prolapsed uterus can cause obstruction of the ureters, leading to hydronephrosis. This is a condition where the kidneys become swollen due to urine failing to properly drain from the kidney to the bladder. Given the patient's history of non-compliance with pessary use, the prolapse has likely persisted, leading to these complications. Therefore, imaging is most likely to reveal hydronephrosis due to the obstructive effects of the uterine prolapse.",9
1554,"The patient presents with confusion and fever, which raises suspicion for an infectious process involving the central nervous system, such as meningitis or encephalitis. The negative neck stiffness and jolt accentuation test, along with an unremarkable CT scan, make bacterial meningitis less likely. However, encephalitis, particularly due to HSV (Herpes Simplex Virus), is a strong consideration given the patient's age and symptoms. While bacterial meningitis is possible, the absence of classic signs and negative initial tests make it less likely. PCR of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is the definitive test to diagnose HSV encephalitis, but in an emergency setting with high suspicion, empirical treatment with Acyclovir is often started immediately. This is because HSV encephalitis can rapidly progress if not treated promptly. Therefore, the best next step is to start Acyclovir.",9
1576,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of infective endocarditis, particularly subacute bacterial endocarditis, given the symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, low-grade fever, and bleeding spots (petechiae). The recent dental appointment is a significant clue, as dental procedures can introduce oral bacteria into the bloodstream. The presence of a pansystolic murmur and valvular vegetations on the mitral valve further support this diagnosis. The most common organism associated with subacute bacterial endocarditis following dental procedures is Streptococcus viridans, which is part of the normal oral flora. The laboratory findings, including elevated ESR and WBC count, are consistent with an inflammatory process such as endocarditis. Therefore, the blood cultures are most likely to yield Streptococcus viridans.",9
1577,"The patient has a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) on her Pap smear and a positive HPV test. Colposcopy and biopsy show CIN 1, which is a low-grade lesion. In cases where there is a discrepancy between the Pap smear (HSIL) and the biopsy (CIN 1), further evaluation is needed. Typically, CIN 1 is managed with observation, but given the high-grade Pap result, more definitive management is warranted. A loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) is appropriate to ensure that any high-grade lesions are treated and to obtain a more definitive diagnosis.",9
1579,"The patient presents with prolonged bleeding after a tooth extraction and has a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) with a normal activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). This pattern suggests a deficiency in the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade, which primarily involves Factor VII. Factor VII deficiency would lead to an isolated prolongation of PT, as Factor VII is part of the extrinsic pathway that is assessed by the PT test. The normal aPTT indicates that the intrinsic and common pathways are likely intact, ruling out deficiencies in factors that would affect both PT and aPTT, such as Factor V or Factor II. Factor XIII deficiency would not affect PT or aPTT as it is involved in cross-linking fibrin, not in the initial formation of the fibrin clot.",9
1582,"The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of an aortic dissection. The acute onset of severe, sharp, retrosternal chest pain radiating to the back and shoulders, along with the significant difference in blood pressure between the arms, is characteristic of this condition. The diastolic decrescendo murmur over the left sternal border suggests aortic regurgitation, which can occur due to aortic dissection. The widened mediastinum on chest X-ray further supports this diagnosis. While acute myocardial infarction could present with chest pain, the blood pressure discrepancy and widened mediastinum are more indicative of aortic dissection. Pulmonary embolism typically presents with pleuritic chest pain and may not cause a widened mediastinum. Aortic regurgitation is a finding rather than a primary diagnosis in this context.",9
1583,"To determine how many people have an LDL cholesterol level less than 300 mg/dL, we need to calculate the z-score for 300 mg/dL using the given mean and standard deviation. The formula for the z-score is:

z = (X - μ) / σ

where X is the value of interest (300 mg/dL), μ is the mean (200 mg/dL), and σ is the standard deviation (50 mg/dL).

z = (300 - 200) / 50 = 100 / 50 = 2

A z-score of 2 corresponds to the percentage of the population below this value in a standard normal distribution. Consulting a standard normal distribution table, a z-score of 2 corresponds to approximately 97.5% of the population.

Therefore, 97.5% of 1000 participants have an LDL cholesterol level less than 300 mg/dL.

0.975 * 1000 = 975

Thus, 975 people have a cholesterol level less than 300 mg/dL.",10

1585,"Capsular polysaccharide vaccines are designed to protect against bacteria with polysaccharide capsules. Neisseria meningitidis, a bacterium that can cause meningitis, has a polysaccharide capsule. Vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis often contain capsular polysaccharides to stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the capsule, providing protection against infection. Smallpox is a viral infection, and the vaccine for it does not involve capsular polysaccharides. Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Clostridium tetani are bacteria, but their vaccines are toxoid-based, not polysaccharide-based.",9
1584,"The clinical presentation of recurrent infections, easy bruising, hypopigmented skin, and silvery hair, along with laboratory findings of pancytopenia and giant cytoplasmic granules in granulocytes and platelets, is characteristic of Chediak-Higashi syndrome. This condition is caused by a defect in the lysosomal trafficking regulator gene, leading to impaired lysosomal fusion and function. The presence of giant granules in cells is a hallmark of this syndrome, resulting from the accumulation of large lysosomal vesicles due to defective trafficking.",10
1587,"The flow of blood through a vessel is determined by Poiseuille's law, which states that flow is proportional to the fourth power of the radius of the vessel. If the diameter of the vessel is reduced to 50% of its original size, the radius is also reduced to 50% of its original size. Since flow is proportional to the fourth power of the radius, the flow will be (0.5)^4 = 0.0625 times the original flow. This means the flow is reduced to 6.25% of its original value, which corresponds to a decrease of 93.75% from baseline.",10
1589,"The patient's symptoms and history are suggestive of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), likely emphysema, given her significant smoking history and the chest X-ray finding of flattened diaphragms. In COPD, particularly emphysema, pulmonary function tests typically show an obstructive pattern. This is characterized by a decreased FEV1/FVC ratio due to airflow limitation. Additionally, emphysema often leads to hyperinflation of the lungs, resulting in an increased total lung capacity (TLC). Therefore, the expected findings on pulmonary function testing would be a decreased FEV1/FVC ratio and an increased TLC.",10
1591,"The patient experienced syncope with preceding palpitations and diaphoresis, suggesting a possible arrhythmic cause. His ECG shows an old bifascicular block, which can be associated with intermittent high-grade AV block or other arrhythmias. The echocardiogram and Holter monitor were normal, which means the arrhythmia might be intermittent and not captured during the monitoring period. A continuous loop recorder is useful for capturing infrequent arrhythmias over a longer period, making it the best next step in this case.",9
1586,"The patient is a 6-year-old African American boy with fever, jaundice, normochromic normocytic anemia, and generalized bone pain. He has a history of recurrent bone pain, which is characteristic of vaso-occlusive crises seen in sickle cell disease. The laboratory findings show anemia with a high reticulocyte count, indicating hemolysis. The peripheral blood smear shows target cells and elongated cells, which are consistent with sickle cell disease. The presence of erythrocytes with nuclear remnants (Howell-Jolly bodies) suggests functional asplenia, which is common in sickle cell disease due to repeated splenic infarctions. The Hb electrophoresis would likely show HbS, confirming sickle cell disease. The other options do not fit the clinical picture as well as sickle cell disease does. Von-Gierke’s disease is a glycogen storage disorder, G6PD deficiency typically presents with episodic hemolysis triggered by oxidative stress, and HbC disease would not typically present with such severe symptoms or bone pain.",9
1595,"The patient is likely experiencing hypovolemic shock due to significant fluid loss from burns. In hypovolemic shock, the primary issue is decreased intravascular volume, leading to decreased cardiac output. The body compensates by increasing systemic vascular resistance to maintain blood pressure. Pulmonary artery wedge pressure, which reflects left atrial pressure, is typically decreased due to reduced preload from the low blood volume. Therefore, the expected hemodynamic parameters are decreased cardiac output, increased systemic vascular resistance, and decreased pulmonary artery wedge pressure.",9
1593,"To calculate the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), we need to determine the proportion of true positive results among all positive test results. In this study, there are 500 patients with AD and 500 without AD. Among the patients with AD, 400 test positive (true positives). Among the patients without AD, 50 test positive (false positives). Therefore, the total number of positive test results is 400 (true positives) + 50 (false positives) = 450. The PPV is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the total number of positive test results: PPV = 400 / (400 + 50).",10
1594,"The patient presents with symptoms indicative of pellagra, which is caused by niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency. The symptoms of pellagra include dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia, which align with the patient's presentation of inflamed skin, diarrhea, and behavioral changes. Additionally, the bright red and smooth tongue suggests glossitis, which can be associated with vitamin deficiencies, including niacin.

Niacin is synthesized in the body from tryptophan, and this process requires vitamin B2 (riboflavin) and vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) as cofactors. Therefore, the statement that synthesis requires vitamin B2 and B6 is true for niacin.

Thus, the correct answer is D.",9
1588,"The patient presents with chronic kidney disease, as indicated by the elevated creatinine and shrunken kidneys on ultrasound. The history of naproxen use (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) and the presence of papillary calcifications suggest analgesic nephropathy, which is associated with chronic use of NSAIDs. NSAIDs can cause renal papillary necrosis and chronic interstitial nephritis. The mechanism involves the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, leading to decreased renal blood flow and ischemia, particularly affecting the renal papillae. This is consistent with the ultrasound findings of papillary calcifications and shrunken kidneys. Thus, the most likely underlying mechanism is inhibition of prostacyclin production, which is a type of prostaglandin.",9
1603,"The patient's symptoms suggest a neurological issue related to vitamin B12 deficiency. The numbness, fatigue, and shortness of breath, along with the neurological signs such as absent vibration and position sense, broad-based gait, and positive Romberg sign (swaying with eyes closed), are indicative of subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. This condition is often due to vitamin B12 deficiency, which can lead to elevated methylmalonic acid levels. The other options do not fit the clinical picture: poliovirus RNA would suggest polio, oligoclonal bands are associated with multiple sclerosis, and a positive rapid plasma reagin test indicates syphilis. Therefore, the most likely laboratory finding is elevated methylmalonic acid levels.",9
1597,"The patient presents with sudden-onset abdominal pain and a testicular exam showing a right testicle that is elevated with a horizontal lie. These findings are classic for testicular torsion, which is a surgical emergency. The absence of tenderness in the abdomen and the specific testicular findings make appendicitis unlikely. Seminoma typically presents as a painless testicular mass, not with acute pain or the described testicular position. Traumatic urethral injury would not cause the testicular findings described. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is testicular torsion.",9
1601,"The alveolar carbon dioxide pressure (PACO2) is inversely related to the alveolar ventilation rate. In this case, the patient is hyperventilating with a respiratory rate of 28/min compared to her normal rate of 14/min. This means her alveolar ventilation has approximately doubled. Since CO2 production is constant, doubling the ventilation rate will approximately halve the PACO2. Her normal PACO2 is 36 mm Hg. Therefore, if her ventilation rate doubles, her PACO2 will be approximately 36 mm Hg / 2 = 18 mm Hg.",9
1602,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), including difficulty initiating urination and nocturia. The digital rectal examination reveals a uniformly enlarged prostate, which is consistent with BPH. Additionally, the patient has hypertension. 

The goal is to choose a medication that can address both BPH and hypertension. 

- Phenoxybenzamine is a non-selective alpha blocker used primarily for pheochromocytoma, not BPH or hypertension.
- Tamsulosin is an alpha-1 blocker that specifically targets the prostate, improving urinary symptoms without significantly affecting blood pressure.
- Terazosin is an alpha-1 blocker that can treat both BPH and hypertension by relaxing smooth muscle in the prostate and blood vessels.
- α-Methyldopa is an antihypertensive used primarily in pregnancy and does not address BPH.

Given the need to treat both BPH and hypertension, Terazosin is the most appropriate choice as it can manage both conditions effectively.",9
1606,"The patient presents with acute onset of neurological symptoms, including difficulty speaking, confusion, and right-sided facial droop, which are suggestive of a stroke. The irregular heart rate and absence of P waves on ECG indicate atrial fibrillation, which is a common cause of embolic strokes. In the setting of a suspected acute stroke, the priority is to determine if there is a hemorrhage or ischemia, as this will guide further management. A CT scan of the head is the fastest and most appropriate initial imaging modality to rule out intracranial hemorrhage. This is crucial before considering thrombolytic therapy or other interventions. Therefore, the next step in management is to perform a CT scan of the head.",9
1612,"The patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), characterized by excessive worry about various aspects of life, which is interfering with his daily activities. His wife’s observation that he has always worried about something suggests a chronic pattern. In treating GAD, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like escitalopram are considered first-line long-term treatments due to their efficacy and safety profile. Diazepam, a benzodiazepine, is not suitable for long-term management due to the risk of dependence. Risperidone is an antipsychotic and not typically used for GAD. Therefore, the best long-term treatment option for this patient is escitalopram.",9
1605,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. The key details include the mechanism of injury (twisting of the knee), the sensation of a ""pop,"" knee instability, and the positive anterior drawer test indicating increased anterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur. The ACL originates from the posteromedial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle and inserts on the anterior intercondylar area of the tibia. Therefore, the injured structure, the ACL, originates from the posteromedial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle.",9
1615,"The clinical presentation is consistent with viral conjunctivitis, likely caused by adenovirus, given the bilateral involvement, follicular conjunctivitis, and preauricular lymphadenopathy. The presence of fever and the progression from one eye to the other also support a viral etiology. The slit lamp findings of follicular reaction and fine epithelial keratitis are typical for adenoviral conjunctivitis. In such cases, the management is primarily supportive, as the condition is self-limiting. Topical antibiotics like erythromycin are not indicated as there is no bacterial infection. Topical steroids like prednisolone acetate are generally avoided in viral conjunctivitis due to the risk of prolonging the infection. Topical natamycin is used for fungal infections, which is not relevant here. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is supportive therapy.",9
1616,"The patient's presentation and histopathological findings are consistent with follicular thyroid carcinoma. The key features include a painless neck nodule, well-differentiated cuboidal cells around colloid, and invasion of the thyroid capsule and blood vessels. Follicular thyroid carcinoma is often associated with PAX8-PPAR gamma gene rearrangement. This genetic alteration is involved in the pathogenesis of follicular thyroid carcinoma, leading to the development of this type of thyroid cancer.",9
1619,"The patient presents with proximal muscle weakness, elevated creatine kinase, and elevated liver enzymes, which are suggestive of a myopathy. The history of statin use raises suspicion for statin-induced myopathy. While statin cessation could be a therapeutic step, it is not a diagnostic test. Electromyography (EMG) can help assess muscle function but is not definitive for diagnosing the underlying cause. Autoantibodies could be useful if an autoimmune myopathy is suspected, but the clinical picture and statin use point more towards a toxic or inflammatory myopathy. A muscle biopsy would provide definitive histological evidence of muscle damage and inflammation, confirming the diagnosis of myopathy and ruling out other causes. Therefore, a muscle biopsy is the most accurate diagnostic test in this scenario.",9
1620,"The patient presents with rectal bleeding and a family history of colorectal cancer. The colonoscopy reveals numerous adenomas, which is suggestive of a hereditary condition. The presence of innumerable adenomas, especially at a relatively young age, is characteristic of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). FAP is caused by mutations in the APC gene, which is a tumor suppressor gene. This condition leads to the development of hundreds to thousands of adenomatous polyps in the colon and rectum, significantly increasing the risk of colorectal cancer. The other options are associated with different conditions: DNA mismatch repair gene mutations are linked to Lynch syndrome, RB1 gene inactivation is associated with retinoblastoma, and BRCA1/BRCA2 gene inactivation is linked to breast and ovarian cancers.",9
1622,"The clinical scenario describes a child who undergoes regular blood exchanges and has a history of bone pain crises, which are characteristic of sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease is caused by a specific genetic mutation: a single amino acid substitution in the beta-globin chain of hemoglobin. This substitution is from glutamic acid to valine at the sixth position of the beta-globin chain, resulting in hemoglobin S (HbS). This mutation leads to the sickling of red blood cells under low oxygen conditions, causing vaso-occlusive crises and other complications. The presence of an uncle with similar treatment suggests a hereditary condition, consistent with sickle cell disease. Therefore, the mechanism most likely explaining this patient's condition is an amino acid substitution.",9
1625,"The patient's symptoms and colonoscopy findings are suggestive of Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease is characterized by transmural inflammation and can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, often presenting with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. The colonoscopy findings of perianal inflammation and transmural inflammation in the colon are classic for Crohn's disease. One of the complications associated with Crohn's disease is the formation of kidney stones, particularly calcium oxalate stones, due to malabsorption issues that lead to increased oxalate absorption. Therefore, kidney stones are most strongly associated with this patient's condition.",9
1624,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), including morning stiffness of the joints and improvement with warm baths. The pulmonary function test results indicate an obstructive pattern with decreased DLCO, and the chest X-ray shows multiple nodules with calcification, which can be associated with rheumatoid nodules in the lungs. The most specific antibody for rheumatoid arthritis is anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP).",9
1623,"The patient's presentation and echocardiography findings are suggestive of a left atrial myxoma. Myxomas are the most common primary cardiac tumors in adults and are often located in the left atrium. The symptoms of brief loss of consciousness, slurred speech, and facial numbness could be due to embolic events from the tumor. The diastolic murmur and the widely split S1 suggest mitral valve involvement. A left atrial myxoma can cause obstruction of blood flow through the mitral valve, leading to symptoms similar to mitral stenosis. This obstruction can cause a diastolic murmur and contribute to the patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and chest pain. Therefore, the most likely complication of this patient's condition is mitral valve obstruction.",9
1628,"The patient is a 57-year-old man with a significant smoking history of 35 pack-years who quit smoking 5 years ago. According to the current guidelines, individuals aged 50 to 80 years with a 20 pack-year smoking history who currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years should undergo annual screening for lung cancer with a low-dose CT scan (LDCT) of the chest. This patient fits the criteria for lung cancer screening because he is within the age range and has a significant smoking history, having quit smoking 5 years ago. Therefore, the recommended preventative screening test for this patient is a low-dose CT scan of the chest.",9
1630,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest sensorineural hearing loss. The key points are the progressive hearing loss over several years, difficulty understanding speech especially with background noise, tinnitus, and dizziness. The Weber test shows no lateralization, and the Rinne test shows air conduction greater than bone conduction, both of which are consistent with sensorineural hearing loss. The symptoms of tinnitus and dizziness further support this. The most common cause of sensorineural hearing loss in older adults is presbycusis, which involves degeneration of cochlear hair cells. Other options like cholesteatoma (A) and otosclerosis (B) would typically present with conductive hearing loss, and Meniere's disease (D) would present with episodic vertigo and fluctuating hearing loss, not the steady symptoms described here.",9
1629,"The patient's symptoms and urinalysis suggest a urinary tract infection (UTI). The culture shows gram-negative bacilli that are lactose-negative and indole-negative, which produce a substance that hydrolyzes urea to produce ammonia. This description matches Proteus mirabilis, which is known for its ability to hydrolyze urea due to the production of urease, leading to ammonia production. Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae are lactose-positive, and Escherichia coli is lactose-positive and indole-positive, making them unlikely causes given the culture results.",9
1637,"The patient's symptoms and presentation are suggestive of rubella infection, especially given the fine pink rash that started on the face and spread to the neck, along with posterior auricular lymphadenopathy. Rubella is a concern during pregnancy due to the risk of congenital rubella syndrome, which can cause serious fetal harm. The most appropriate next step is to confirm the diagnosis by testing for rubella antibodies in her blood. This will help determine if she has a current rubella infection or if she is immune. Administering anti-rubella antibodies or considering termination of pregnancy would be premature without confirming the diagnosis. Isolation is not typically required for rubella in adults, especially in a non-hospital setting.",9
1632,"The patient presents with back pain, difficulty urinating, and osteoblastic lesions in the spine. These symptoms and findings are suggestive of metastatic prostate cancer. Prostate cancer often metastasizes to the bone, causing osteoblastic lesions. The difficulty urinating could be due to prostate enlargement or obstruction, which is common in prostate cancer. 

Continuous leuprolide is a GnRH agonist used in the treatment of prostate cancer. It works by initially stimulating and then downregulating the pituitary gland's release of LH and FSH, leading to decreased testosterone production, which is effective in treating prostate cancer.

Imatinib is used for chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.

Rituximab is used for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas and some autoimmune diseases.

Tamsulosin is an alpha-blocker used to relieve urinary symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia, but it does not treat prostate cancer itself.

Therefore, the drug most likely to be effective in treating this patient's disease is continuous leuprolide.",9
1641,"The patient is presenting with signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is characterized by thrombocytopenia, prolonged PT and PTT, and a positive D-dimer. DIC is often triggered by sepsis, as in this case with E. coli infection. The management of DIC involves treating the underlying cause (in this case, the infection with antibiotics) and supportive care to manage bleeding and coagulation abnormalities. 

Cryoprecipitate and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) are used to replace clotting factors and fibrinogen in patients with significant bleeding due to DIC. Low-dose subcutaneous heparin can be used in DIC to prevent thromboembolic complications, especially in patients who are not actively bleeding. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's DIC is to provide supportive care with cryoprecipitate, FFP, and low-dose SC heparin.",9
1642,"The patient presents with confusion, severe headache, and very high blood pressure (202/128 mm Hg), which suggests hypertensive encephalopathy. The unremarkable CT scan rules out acute hemorrhage, and the MRI likely shows changes consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), which is associated with severe hypertension. The next best step in management is to lower the blood pressure to prevent further neurological damage. IV nicardipine is a calcium channel blocker that can be used to safely and effectively lower blood pressure in this acute setting.",9
1643,"The patient is experiencing bizarre thoughts, specifically a belief that he is being haunted by aliens. This belief is not based in reality and is persistent despite evidence to the contrary. Such a belief is characteristic of a delusion, which is defined as a fixed false belief. The other options do not accurately describe the primary symptom presented. Negative symptoms refer to deficits of normal emotional responses or thought processes, such as lack of interest or motivation, which are also present but not the focus of the question. Disorganized thinking would involve incoherent speech or thought processes, which is not described here. Cognitive behavioral therapy can be used to address some symptoms of psychosis, but the question asks for a description of the symptom itself. Therefore, the correct answer is that the patient has a fixed false belief.",9
1614,,0
1645,"The patient's symptoms and the description of lesions that can be easily scraped off suggest oral thrush, which is caused by Candida albicans. A common risk factor for oral thrush is immunosuppression, particularly a decline in CD4+ T-cells, as seen in HIV/AIDS. Inhalation of corticosteroids (not salbutamol) can also predispose to oral thrush, but salbutamol itself is not a risk factor. Chronic nicotine abuse and Epstein-Barr virus infection are not directly associated with oral thrush. Therefore, the most likely risk factor for this patient's findings is a decline in CD4+ T-cells.",9
1658,"The patient presents with abdominal pain, fever, and leukocytosis, which are suggestive of an inflammatory or infectious process in the abdomen. The left lower quadrant tenderness is particularly indicative of diverticulitis, a common condition in older adults. In diverticulitis, the most accurate test to confirm the diagnosis and assess for complications such as abscess or perforation is a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. A CT scan can provide detailed images of the colon and surrounding structures, helping to identify inflamed diverticula, abscesses, or other complications. Other options like barium enema, colonoscopy, and sigmoidoscopy are not appropriate in the acute setting due to the risk of perforation and are not as effective in diagnosing diverticulitis.",9
1653,"The patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with essential tremor, which is characterized by a postural and action tremor that can improve with alcohol consumption. The first-line treatment for essential tremor is propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker. Propranolol is also used in the treatment of hyperthyroidism, particularly for controlling symptoms such as tremors and palpitations associated with increased adrenergic activity.",9
1650,"Cilostazol inhibits phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3), leading to an increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. Elevated cAMP in cardiac myocytes enhances calcium influx, which increases the force of contraction, resulting in a positive inotropic effect. This is similar to the mechanism of action of other PDE3 inhibitors like milrinone, which are known for their positive inotropic effects. Therefore, the expected effect of cilostazol, given its mechanism of action, is positive inotropy.",9
1660,"In this scenario, the patient has designated his wife as the durable power of attorney for healthcare decisions, which means she is legally authorized to make medical decisions on his behalf when he is unable to do so. The absence of a living will means there is no documented advance directive specifying the patient's wishes. The wife, as the durable power of attorney, has the authority to make decisions regarding the withdrawal of care based on her understanding of the patient's wishes. While the daughter's disagreement is emotionally significant, legally, the wife’s decision takes precedence as she holds the durable power of attorney. Therefore, the best course of action is to respect the decision of the wife, who is the legally designated decision-maker.",9
1651,"The patient's symptoms of progressive shortness of breath, history of pulmonary metastases, and the finding of a loud P2 on examination suggest pulmonary hypertension. A loud P2 is indicative of increased pressure in the pulmonary artery. Given her history of pulmonary metastases, there could be residual effects on the pulmonary vasculature leading to pulmonary hypertension. In pulmonary hypertension, the right ventricle has to work harder to pump blood into the pulmonary artery, leading to right ventricular hypertrophy. Additionally, the pulmonary artery may become dilated due to the increased pressure. Therefore, an echocardiogram would likely show right ventricular hypertrophy and a dilated pulmonary artery.",9
1662,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest contact dermatitis, likely due to exposure to plants such as poison ivy, oak, or sumac during her trekking trip. The rash is itchy and blistering, which is characteristic of this condition. Contact dermatitis from such plants is a classic example of a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction, which is a delayed-type hypersensitivity mediated by T-cells. This reaction typically occurs 24-48 hours after exposure, aligning with the patient's timeline of symptoms appearing a day after her trip.",9
1663,"The presentation of hip pain in a 6-year-old boy following a recent upper respiratory infection, with minor pain on examination and normal range of motion, suggests transient synovitis. This condition is common in children and often follows a viral infection. The key features include mild pain, normal or slightly limited range of motion, and absence of systemic symptoms like fever. The best management for transient synovitis is conservative treatment with NSAIDs and rest, as it is self-limiting. Radiography or MRI is not immediately necessary unless symptoms persist or worsen, and aspiration with antibiotics is indicated for suspected septic arthritis, which is less likely given the clinical presentation.",9
1672,"The patient has a history of aggressive breast cancer with a poor prognosis, as indicated by the rapid progression to metastatic disease involving the brain, liver, and lymph nodes. The description of the breast mass and skin changes suggests a highly aggressive form of breast cancer. Additionally, the family history of early-onset breast cancer in her mother suggests a possible genetic component, such as BRCA mutations, which are often associated with triple-negative breast cancer (ER, PR, HER2 negative). Triple-negative breast cancer is more common in younger women and African American women and is known for its aggressive nature and poor prognosis, which aligns with the patient's clinical presentation.",9
1679,"The functional residual capacity (FRC) is the volume of air present in the lungs at the end of passive expiration. It is calculated as the sum of the residual volume (RV) and the expiratory reserve volume (ERV). 

Given:
- Residual volume (RV) = 1700 mL
- Expiratory reserve volume (ERV) = 1500 mL

FRC = RV + ERV = 1700 mL + 1500 mL = 3200 mL

Therefore, the functional residual capacity of this patient is 3200 mL.",10
1671,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with a transient ischemic attack (TIA), likely due to embolic events from carotid artery stenosis. The left internal carotid artery, with 50% stenosis, is more likely responsible for the symptoms, as it supplies the left hemisphere, which controls the right side of the body and language functions. According to Poiseuille's law, resistance to blood flow is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius of the vessel. A 50% reduction in diameter (or radius) of the artery would result in a 16-fold increase in resistance (since (1/0.5)^4 = 16). Therefore, the resistance to blood flow through the stenotic left internal carotid artery is expected to be 16 times greater.",9
1670,"The patient's symptoms of lethargy, feeling cold, and difficulty swallowing, along with the presence of a midline neck mass, suggest hypothyroidism potentially due to a thyroid disorder. The midline neck mass is likely an enlarged thyroid gland, possibly a goiter. The difficulty swallowing solids but not liquids can occur with a large goiter pressing on the esophagus. Hypothyroidism is often associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which is characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid gland. However, the question asks about the structure seen in a biopsy of the mass. In a thyroid gland biopsy, especially in the context of a goiter, one would expect to see thyroid follicles filled with colloid. This is characteristic of thyroid tissue. Therefore, the most likely structure seen in the biopsy of this mass would be follicles with colloid.",9
1682,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are suggestive of a femoral hernia. Femoral hernias occur when abdominal contents protrude through the femoral canal, which is located below the inguinal ligament. The femoral canal is bordered by the inguinal ligament anteriorly, the lacunar ligament medially, the femoral vein laterally, and the pubic bone posteriorly. The swelling, erythema, and tenderness in the right groin, along with the location below the inguinal ligament, are consistent with a femoral hernia. Incarceration or strangulation of the hernia can lead to severe pain, nausea, and vomiting, as seen in this patient. The most likely structures involved in the entrapment of the hernia are the lacunar ligament and the femoral vein.",9
1684,"The newborn presents with microcephaly, spasticity, hyperreflexia, pigmentary retinal mottling, and hearing loss. These findings are consistent with congenital Zika syndrome, which is associated with maternal Zika virus infection during pregnancy. The mother traveled to Brazil, a region known for Zika virus outbreaks, during her first trimester, which is a critical period for fetal development. Zika virus is transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes. Therefore, the use of mosquito repellant to prevent mosquito bites during her travel would have been the most effective measure to prevent this condition.",9
1675,"The patient is a 71-year-old man with significant carotid artery stenosis, as shown by duplex ultrasonography. He has an 85% stenosis on the left and a 55% stenosis on the right. He is asymptomatic, meaning he has not experienced any symptoms such as transient ischemic attacks or strokes. In asymptomatic patients, carotid endarterectomy is generally recommended when the stenosis is 70% or greater, especially if the patient has a reasonable life expectancy and the surgical risk is low. This is because the risk of stroke is significantly reduced with surgical intervention in cases of high-grade stenosis. Carotid artery stenting is typically reserved for patients who are at high surgical risk. Reassurance is not appropriate given the high degree of stenosis on the left side. Bilateral carotid endarterectomy is not indicated as the right side stenosis is only 55%. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is a left carotid endarterectomy.",9
1685,"The patient's symptoms of fatigue, constipation, fuller cheeks, hoarse voice, bradycardia, dry skin, and brittle nails, along with the presence of antibodies against thyroid peroxidase, suggest hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune condition characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid gland. On biopsy, it typically shows lymphocytic infiltration, Hürthle cells (which are altered follicular cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm), and the formation of germinal centers. These findings are consistent with the chronic inflammatory process seen in Hashimoto's thyroiditis.",9
1686,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of hemorrhagic cystitis, which is a known side effect of certain chemotherapeutic agents, particularly cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide. These drugs can cause bladder irritation due to the metabolite acrolein. To prevent this, a thiol compound called mesna (2-mercaptoethane sulfonate) is used. Mesna binds to acrolein in the urine, reducing its toxic effects on the bladder epithelium. The patient's history of recent cancer therapy and the presence of blood in the urine without infection or other causes strongly suggest that she is experiencing this side effect. Therefore, the medication that could have prevented her symptoms is mesna, which corresponds to option B.",9
1690,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest hereditary spherocytosis. The key features include jaundice, anemia, splenomegaly, increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and spherocytes on the peripheral blood smear. The family history of splenectomy in the father also supports a hereditary condition. The osmotic fragility test has traditionally been used to diagnose hereditary spherocytosis, but the eosin-5-maleimide (EMA) binding test is now considered more sensitive and specific for this condition. The EMA binding test detects decreased binding of the dye to the red blood cells, which is characteristic of hereditary spherocytosis due to defects in membrane proteins.",9
1694,"In preconception care, it is important to ensure that the patient is up-to-date with vaccinations and to start folic acid supplementation to prevent neural tube defects. 

- **Option A**: Folic acid supplementation is recommended to reduce the risk of neural tube defects, so beginning 400 mcg folic acid is appropriate.

- **Option B**: The inactivated influenza vaccine is safe and recommended for women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant during flu season.

- **Option C**: The MMR vaccine is a live vaccine and should not be administered during pregnancy or immediately before conception. If the patient is not immune, she should be vaccinated and advised to wait at least one month before trying to conceive.

- **Option D**: Checking varicella immunity is part of preconception care to ensure the patient is protected against chickenpox during pregnancy.

Therefore, the administration of the MMR vaccine is not recommended at this time if she plans to conceive soon.",9
1698,"The patient's presentation of abdominal distension, undulating pain, nausea, vomiting, and eosinophilia, along with the CT scan findings of multiple small eggshell calcifications in the liver, suggests a parasitic infection. The key detail is the eggshell calcifications in the liver, which are characteristic of hydatid cysts caused by Echinococcus granulosus. This parasite is commonly associated with exposure to livestock, which aligns with the patient's occupation as a farmer who interacts with livestock and breeds dogs. The other options do not typically cause liver cysts with eggshell calcifications. Enterobius vermicularis causes perianal itching, Necator americanus causes anemia due to hookworm infection, and Taenia solium can cause cysticercosis but not typically liver calcifications.",9
1696,"Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic medication that works by blocking the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the airways. This action prevents the binding of acetylcholine, which would normally lead to bronchoconstriction. The muscarinic receptors are linked to the phosphoinositol second messenger system. When acetylcholine binds to these receptors, it activates phospholipase C, leading to the production of inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which ultimately results in increased intracellular calcium and bronchoconstriction. By blocking these receptors, ipratropium bromide reduces bronchoconstriction and alleviates asthma symptoms. Therefore, the second messenger system affected by ipratropium bromide is the phosphoinositol system.",9
1699,"The patient's symptoms of weakness, fatigue, and peripheral edema, along with the echocardiogram findings of preserved ejection fraction and impaired diastolic relaxation, suggest a diagnosis of restrictive cardiomyopathy. Restrictive cardiomyopathy is characterized by impaired ventricular filling due to stiff ventricular walls, while systolic function (ejection fraction) is typically preserved. 

The potential causes listed are:

A. Previous treatment with doxorubicin - This is associated with dilated cardiomyopathy, not restrictive cardiomyopathy.

B. Hemochromatosis - This condition can lead to restrictive cardiomyopathy due to iron deposition in the myocardium, causing stiffness and impaired diastolic function.

C. History of myocardial infarction - This typically leads to ischemic cardiomyopathy, which is more often associated with systolic dysfunction.

D. History of a recent viral infection - This is associated with myocarditis, which can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy.

Given the preserved ejection fraction and impaired diastolic relaxation, hemochromatosis is the most likely cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy in this patient.",9
1703,"The man's symptoms suggest cystic fibrosis (CF), an autosomal recessive disorder. For a child to be affected, both parents must carry a mutant allele. The man is affected, so he has two mutant alleles. His wife is from a population where the incidence of CF is 1 in 10,000. The carrier frequency (q) can be calculated using the Hardy-Weinberg principle: q^2 = 1/10,000, so q = 1/100. The probability that the wife is a carrier is 2q = 2/100 = 1/50. If she is a carrier, the probability of having an affected child is 1/2 (since the man contributes one mutant allele and the wife would contribute the other). Therefore, the overall probability is (1/50) * (1/2) = 1/100 = 1%.",9
1709,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of pyloric stenosis, which is common in infants around this age. The key features include projectile vomiting after feeds, non-bilious vomitus, and signs of dehydration (dry mucous membranes). The decrease in weight percentile also suggests poor nutrition due to vomiting. The best next step to confirm the diagnosis of pyloric stenosis is an abdominal ultrasound, which can visualize the thickened pylorus. Other options like a trial of cow's milk-free diet or proton pump inhibitors are not appropriate given the classic presentation of pyloric stenosis.",9
1707,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs consistent with pericarditis: sharp chest pain that worsens with lying down, fever, and a pericardial friction rub. The ECG findings of widespread concave ST elevations and PR depressions are classic for pericarditis. Given the history of a myocardial infarction 3 weeks ago, the most likely cause is Dressler’s syndrome, which is a form of post-myocardial infarction pericarditis that occurs weeks to months after the event. This condition is thought to be immune-mediated.",10
1704,"To calculate the relative risk (RR) of death from cardiac causes, we need to compare the risk in the medication 1 group to the risk in the medication 2 group. 

First, calculate the risk of death in each group:
- Risk in Medication 1 group = Number of deaths in Medication 1 group / Total number in Medication 1 group = 134 / 1500
- Risk in Medication 2 group = Number of deaths in Medication 2 group / Total number in Medication 2 group = 210 / 1500

Next, calculate the relative risk:
- RR = (Risk in Medication 1 group) / (Risk in Medication 2 group)

Perform the calculations:
- Risk in Medication 1 = 134 / 1500 = 0.0893
- Risk in Medication 2 = 210 / 1500 = 0.14

- RR = 0.0893 / 0.14 = 0.6379

Round to the nearest whole number: 64%

Therefore, the relative risk of death from cardiac causes is 64%.",9
1711,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs consistent with myocarditis following a recent upper respiratory tract infection. The clinical presentation includes shortness of breath, fatigue, lower limb edema, hypotension, tachycardia, and an S3 gallop, along with echocardiographic findings of severe dilation of all heart chambers and reduced ejection fraction. These findings suggest dilated cardiomyopathy secondary to myocarditis. The most common cause of myocarditis, particularly following a viral infection, is viral myocarditis, which typically shows lymphocytic infiltration on histological examination. Therefore, the expected microscopic finding on endomyocardial biopsy in this case would be infiltration with lymphocytes.",9
1712,"The patient has NYHA class III heart failure and is currently on an ACE inhibitor (captopril), a diuretic (furosemide), and other medications for comorbid conditions. In heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), beta-blockers are recommended as they improve survival and reduce hospitalizations. The appropriate beta-blockers for heart failure include carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, and bisoprolol. Metoprolol succinate is the extended-release form that is specifically indicated for heart failure, whereas metoprolol tartrate is not. Therefore, the correct addition to his regimen would be metoprolol succinate.",9
1713,"The patient presents with symptoms and findings suggestive of a molar pregnancy, such as vaginal bleeding, a uterus larger than expected for gestational age, bilateral adnexal masses (which could be theca-lutein cysts), and a very high β-hCG level. The most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis of a molar pregnancy is a transvaginal ultrasound, which would show a 'snowstorm' pattern or absence of a viable fetus in the case of a complete mole.",9
1680,"The clinical presentation suggests narcolepsy, characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, sudden sleep episodes, and hypnagogic hallucinations (dream-like sensations upon falling asleep). The patient's obesity and high palatal ridges might suggest obstructive sleep apnea, but he experiences sudden sleep attacks and hallucinations, which are more indicative of narcolepsy. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is used for sleep apnea, not narcolepsy. Scheduling regular naps and ensuring adequate nighttime sleep can help manage narcolepsy symptoms, but the patient's symptoms are more severe. Abstaining from blue light exposure is generally advised for improving sleep hygiene but won't address the narcoleptic episodes. An inhibitor of dopamine reuptake, such as modafinil, is used to treat narcolepsy by promoting wakefulness.",9
1717,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest a diagnosis of X-linked agammaglobulinemia (Bruton's agammaglobulinemia). This condition is characterized by recurrent bacterial infections due to low levels of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, and IgM) and a lack of mature B cells. The disease is caused by a defect in the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) gene, which is crucial for B-cell development. BTK is active during the transition from the pro-B-cell stage to the pre-B-cell stage. In X-linked agammaglobulinemia, the defect occurs at the pre-B-cell stage, preventing further maturation of B cells and leading to the absence of mature B cells and immunoglobulins.",9
1720,"The clinical presentation of this patient suggests a condition involving both the lungs and kidneys, characterized by hemoptysis and renal impairment. The negative antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody (ANCA) test helps rule out ANCA-associated vasculitis, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis. The combination of pulmonary hemorrhage and renal failure, along with the negative ANCA, points towards Goodpasture syndrome, which is characterized by anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies. In Goodpasture syndrome, the kidney biopsy typically shows crescentic glomerulonephritis due to the presence of fibrin and macrophages in Bowman space, leading to the formation of crescents. Therefore, the light microscopy finding most consistent with this condition is fibrin crescents in Bowman space.",9
1722,"The patient has been diagnosed with depression and started on sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). SSRIs typically take 4-6 weeks to show full therapeutic effects. The patient has been on sertraline for only 3 weeks and has shown minor improvements, which is not uncommon at this stage of treatment. The most appropriate next step is to continue the current treatment to allow more time for the medication to take full effect. Augmenting with another medication or switching treatments is generally considered only after an adequate trial period, usually 6-8 weeks, unless the patient is experiencing severe side effects or worsening symptoms. Therefore, the best course of action is to continue sertraline for a few more weeks.",9
1725,"The patient presents with a sudden onset of severe headache, neck stiffness, and a positive Kernig's sign, which are indicative of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The lumbar puncture shows xanthochromia (yellow-colored fluid), which is consistent with SAH due to the breakdown of blood in the cerebrospinal fluid. The family history of chronic kidney disease and the patient's recurrent urinary tract infections suggest a possible underlying condition such as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), which is associated with the development of saccular (berry) aneurysms. These aneurysms can rupture, leading to SAH. Therefore, the most likely predisposing factor for this patient's condition is a saccular aneurysm.",9
1733,"The patient presents with signs of nephritic-nephrotic syndrome, jaundice, and hepatosplenomegaly, along with a reactive anti-HCV test, suggesting hepatitis C infection. The urinalysis shows significant proteinuria and red cell casts, indicating a glomerulonephritis. Hepatitis C is commonly associated with mixed cryoglobulinemia, which can lead to membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). MPGN associated with hepatitis C typically shows subendothelial immune complex deposits on kidney biopsy. Therefore, the feature of this patient’s condition is subendothelial immune complex deposits.",9
1740,"The patient's symptoms and clinical findings are indicative of a sexually transmitted infection. The key features include painful genital lesions described as red-rimmed, fluid-filled blisters, and swollen, tender inguinal lymph nodes. These symptoms are characteristic of genital herpes, which is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). Syphilis typically presents with a painless chancre, gonorrhea often causes urethritis or cervicitis without blisters, and trichomoniasis usually causes a frothy discharge without blisters. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is genital herpes.",9
1752,"The newborn has a 3-mm membranous ventricular septal defect (VSD) with a significant holosystolic murmur. In newborns, small VSDs often close spontaneously and do not require immediate intervention unless there are signs of heart failure or significant hemodynamic compromise. The child is feeding well, has normal vital signs for a newborn, and shows no signs of distress or heart failure. Therefore, the most appropriate management is to monitor the child with regular outpatient follow-up to assess for spontaneous closure or any development of symptoms. Amoxicillin therapy is not indicated as there is no infection. Prostaglandin E1 is used to keep the ductus arteriosus open in certain congenital heart defects, which is not needed here. Cardiac catheterization is not indicated for a small VSD without complications.",9
1754,"The clinical presentation of the 8-year-old boy includes slurred speech, frequent falls, pes cavus, hammer toes, and kyphoscoliosis. These symptoms are characteristic of Friedreich's ataxia, which is a trinucleotide repeat disorder. Friedreich's ataxia is associated with the GAA trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FXN gene. The other trinucleotide repeats listed are associated with different conditions: CGG is linked to Fragile X syndrome, CAG is linked to Huntington's disease, and GCC is not typically associated with a known trinucleotide repeat disorder. Therefore, the trinucleotide repeat most likely associated with this child's condition is GAA.",9
1756,"The patient is experiencing recurrent distressing thoughts and compulsive behaviors, which are characteristic of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The most appropriate first-line treatment for OCD is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Sertraline is an SSRI and is effective in treating OCD. The other options, olanzapine and risperidone, are antipsychotics and not first-line treatments for OCD. Venlafaxine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) and can be used for anxiety disorders but is not the first choice for OCD. Therefore, sertraline is the most appropriate next step in management.",9
1716,"The patient is pregnant and currently on lithium for bipolar disorder. Lithium is known to have teratogenic effects, particularly causing cardiac anomalies such as Ebstein's anomaly when used during the first trimester. Therefore, continuing lithium without consideration of alternatives is not advisable. Valproate and carbamazepine are also teratogenic, particularly associated with neural tube defects, and are generally avoided during pregnancy. Clonazepam can be used as an adjunct for anxiety or agitation but is not a primary treatment for bipolar disorder. Tapering lithium and considering a safer mood stabilizer like lamotrigine, which has a better safety profile in pregnancy, is a reasonable approach. However, the option to add lamotrigine is not directly provided, and the best immediate step is to taper lithium, as continuing it poses significant risks. Therefore, the best immediate step is to taper lithium and provide a short-term solution like clonazepam for acute symptoms if needed, while planning for a safer long-term mood stabilizer.",9
1764,"The patient's symptoms and colonoscopy findings are consistent with ulcerative colitis (UC), which is characterized by continuous inflammation from the rectum to the cecum. UC is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. In UC, the cancer risk is related to the duration and extent of the disease. The type of dysplasia seen in UC-associated colorectal cancer is often non-polypoid, meaning it does not form polyps like sporadic colorectal cancer. Instead, it tends to be flat and more difficult to detect. This is a key characteristic of dysplasia in the context of inflammatory bowel disease like UC.",9
1765,"The clinical presentation is consistent with absence seizures, characterized by brief episodes of staring, lack of response, and no postictal confusion. The EEG finding of 3-Hz spike-and-wave discharges is classic for absence seizures. The first-line treatment for absence seizures is ethosuximide, which is specifically effective for this type of seizure.",10
1771,"The patient has a perforated appendix with an abscess, and cultures show catalase-producing, anaerobic, gram-negative rods that can grow in bile. These characteristics are consistent with Bacteroides fragilis, a common anaerobic bacterium found in intra-abdominal infections. The most appropriate treatment for Bacteroides fragilis involves antibiotics that cover anaerobic bacteria. Piperacillin, a penicillin antibiotic, is often combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor like tazobactam to cover anaerobes, but the option here is just piperacillin alone, which is not sufficient. Ampicillin and sulbactam is a combination that provides good coverage against anaerobes, including Bacteroides fragilis, due to the beta-lactamase inhibitor sulbactam. Therefore, the most appropriate choice is ampicillin and sulbactam.",9
1691,,0
1773,"The patient was involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision and presents with blood-tinged fluid draining from the nostrils, which is concerning for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea. The presence of a clear ring around the blood on gauze (halo sign) suggests CSF leakage, indicating a possible skull base fracture. Such fractures can lead to CSF rhinorrhea and are often associated with specific signs. Bilateral periorbital ecchymosis (raccoon eyes) and retroauricular ecchymosis (Battle's sign) are classic signs of basilar skull fractures. Given the CSF rhinorrhea, the most likely associated finding would be bilateral periorbital ecchymosis, which is commonly seen with anterior skull base fractures.",9
1747,"The patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with dementia, including forgetfulness, difficulty recalling familiar information, and episodes of incontinence. The MRI findings of ventriculomegaly and prominent cerebral sulci suggest a neurodegenerative process, likely Alzheimer's disease, given the gradual progression of cognitive decline and the patient's age. The Mini-Mental State Examination score of 19/30 indicates moderate cognitive impairment. Donepezil is a cholinesterase inhibitor used to treat mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease by increasing acetylcholine levels in the brain, which can help improve cognitive function. Memantine is typically used for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease, but donepezil is often the first-line treatment for mild to moderate cases. Thiamine is used for Wernicke's encephalopathy, and acetazolamide is used for conditions like idiopathic intracranial hypertension, neither of which fit this clinical picture.",9
1776,"The patient presents with confusion, jaundice, hepatomegaly, and asterixis (flapping tremor), which are indicative of hepatic encephalopathy, a condition often associated with liver failure and elevated ammonia levels. The goal of treatment is to reduce ammonia levels in the blood. Lactulose is a common treatment for hepatic encephalopathy, and it works by acidifying the colon, which converts ammonia (NH3) into ammonium (NH4+), trapping it in the gut and promoting its excretion. Therefore, the mechanism of action that involves the excretion of NH4 is most appropriate for this patient's condition.",9
1782,"The situation involves a physician who is showing signs of impairment, including missed appointments, intra-operative errors, and the smell of alcohol. These behaviors suggest that the colleague may be struggling with substance use or emotional distress following a significant personal loss. The primary concern is patient safety, and the physician's ability to practice medicine safely is in question. While confronting the colleague in private (option C) might seem supportive, it may not adequately address the potential risk to patients. Alerting the State Licensing Board (option B) is a more formal step that might be premature without first attempting to address the issue through supportive channels. Advising residents to report future misconduct (option A) does not address the immediate concern. Informing the local Physician Health Program (option D) is the most appropriate action, as these programs are designed to confidentially help physicians with issues like substance use, ensuring they receive the support they need while protecting patient safety.",9
1783,"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is characterized by joint pain and stiffness, particularly in the morning, and improvement with activity. The involvement of the MCP and wrist joints, along with swelling and warmth, further supports this diagnosis. In RA, the synovial membrane becomes inflamed and thickened, leading to the formation of pannus, which is a proliferation of granulation tissue. This granulation tissue can invade and destroy cartilage and bone. Therefore, a synovial biopsy from an affected joint in RA would most likely show proliferation of granulation tissue.",9
1777,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings that suggest liver dysfunction. Key findings include palmar erythema, tender hepatomegaly, and gynecomastia, which are indicative of liver disease. The laboratory results show an AST to ALT ratio greater than 2:1, which is characteristic of alcoholic liver disease. The GGT is significantly elevated, which is also commonly associated with alcohol use. The normal bilirubin levels and the absence of significant elevation in alkaline phosphatase make acute cholangitis less likely. The normal serum AFP and iron studies do not support hereditary hemochromatosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Acute viral hepatitis typically presents with a more significant elevation in ALT compared to AST, which is not the case here. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is alcoholic hepatitis.",9
627,"The patient is experiencing chest pain consistent with stable angina, which is relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. Nitroglycerin works primarily by being converted to nitric oxide, which causes vasodilation. The primary mechanism by which nitroglycerin relieves angina is through venodilation, which decreases venous return to the heart (preload). This leads to a reduction in end-diastolic volume and pressure, thereby decreasing myocardial oxygen demand. This reduction in preload is the main reason for the relief of anginal symptoms, rather than direct coronary vasodilation, which is less significant in stable angina due to fixed atherosclerotic lesions.",9
630,"The patient is a 68-year-old woman with consistently elevated blood pressure readings, indicating hypertension. Her history includes primary hypothyroidism and an incidental renal cyst, but her thyroid function and renal function are normal. The key factors to consider are her age and the isolated systolic hypertension pattern (elevated systolic with normal diastolic pressure). In older adults, isolated systolic hypertension is often due to decreased arterial compliance, also known as increased arterial stiffness, which is a common age-related change. This leads to higher systolic pressures while diastolic pressures remain normal or low. Other options like increased kidney size or aldosterone production are less likely given the normal renal function and lack of other symptoms like hypokalemia. Decreased baroreceptor sensitivity could contribute to hypertension but is not the primary cause of isolated systolic hypertension in this context.",9
746,"The patient has developed thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and necrotic skin lesions after receiving unfractionated heparin, which are indicative of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT is a prothrombotic condition caused by antibodies against platelet factor 4-heparin complexes, leading to platelet activation and thrombosis. The presence of calf pain and swelling suggests deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a common complication of HIT. The most appropriate management step is to discontinue heparin and start an alternative anticoagulant that does not cross-react with HIT antibodies. Argatroban, a direct thrombin inhibitor, is commonly used in this scenario. Warfarin is not appropriate initially because it can worsen the hypercoagulable state in HIT and should only be started after platelet recovery and overlap with a non-heparin anticoagulant. Vitamin K and platelet transfusion are not appropriate for managing HIT.",9
857,"The patient has esophageal varices due to portal hypertension from cirrhosis, and he has already undergone band ligation to control the acute bleeding. To prevent future episodes of variceal bleeding, the standard management includes non-selective beta-blockers and endoscopic variceal ligation. Non-selective beta-blockers, such as propranolol or nadolol, reduce portal pressure and are used for primary and secondary prophylaxis. Endoscopic variceal ligation is recommended for secondary prophylaxis to prevent rebleeding in patients who have already had a variceal bleed. Octreotide and terlipressin are used for acute variceal bleeding, not for long-term prevention. A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is considered for patients who have recurrent variceal bleeding despite optimal medical and endoscopic therapy. Therefore, the most appropriate recommendation for preventing future morbidity and mortality in this patient, in addition to non-selective beta-blockers, is continued variceal ligation.",9
984,"The clinical presentation of the 6-year-old girl is consistent with nephrotic syndrome, characterized by periorbital edema, hypoalbuminemia, hypercholesterolemia, and significant proteinuria. In children, the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome is Minimal Change Disease (MCD). MCD typically presents with normal glomeruli on light microscopy, as the disease is characterized by effacement of podocyte foot processes, which is only visible on electron microscopy. The other options involve findings that are not typical for MCD: granular deposits and mesangial proliferation are associated with other types of glomerulonephritis, and deposits of IgG and C3 suggest membranous nephropathy. Therefore, the histological examination of a kidney biopsy in this case is most likely to show normal glomeruli on light microscopy.",9
987,"The neonate presents with jaundice and elevated indirect bilirubin levels, which is common in newborns due to physiological jaundice. However, the total bilirubin level of 21.2 mg/dl is quite high, and the indirect bilirubin level of 19.1 mg/dl indicates significant unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The Coombs test is negative, ruling out hemolytic disease of the newborn due to blood group incompatibility. The reticulocyte count is low, suggesting that hemolysis is not the cause. Given the high level of bilirubin, there is a risk of kernicterus, a type of brain damage that can result from very high levels of unconjugated bilirubin. Phototherapy is the standard treatment for reducing high levels of unconjugated bilirubin in newborns and is the most appropriate next step in management to prevent complications.",9
889,"The question provides information about two scatter plots that show statistically significant relationships between median income, weekly work hours, and the difficulty of matching into medical specialties. We need to determine which statement best describes these results.

- Option A suggests that harder-to-match specialties have higher weekly work hours. This would imply a positive correlation between matching difficulty and work hours.
- Option B suggests that weekly work hours have a stronger correlation with matching difficulty than median income. This would mean that the scatter plot for work hours shows a stronger relationship (e.g., higher correlation coefficient) with matching difficulty than the plot for income.
- Option C suggests that median income has a stronger correlation with matching difficulty than weekly work hours. This would mean that the scatter plot for income shows a stronger relationship with matching difficulty than the plot for work hours.
- Option D suggests that higher median income is associated with shorter weekly work hours, implying a negative correlation between income and work hours.

Since both associations are statistically significant, we need to determine which factor (income or work hours) has a stronger correlation with matching difficulty. The question does not provide specific correlation coefficients or additional data to directly compare the strength of these correlations. However, the phrasing of the options suggests that one of the factors is more strongly correlated with matching difficulty.

Given the typical trends in medical specialties, higher income specialties often have more competitive matching processes, which might suggest a stronger correlation between income and matching difficulty. However, without specific data, we rely on the typical interpretation of such analyses.

Therefore, the best choice based on typical trends and the options provided is that median income has a stronger correlation with matching difficulty than weekly work hours.",9
1154,"The patient's symptoms of headache, muscle pain, recurrent fever spikes, jaundice, and splenomegaly, along with the recent travel history, suggest a parasitic infection. The initiation of chloroquine prophylaxis indicates concern for malaria, which is endemic in parts of India and Africa. The photomicrograph of the peripheral blood smear, although not visible here, likely shows features consistent with malaria. Plasmodium falciparum is a common cause of malaria with irregular fever patterns and can cause severe symptoms including jaundice and anemia due to hemolysis. Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas disease, which is not consistent with the travel history or symptoms. Chikungunya virus causes fever and joint pain but not typically jaundice or splenomegaly. Trypanosoma brucei causes African sleeping sickness, which presents with different symptoms. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's findings is Plasmodium falciparum.",9
1173,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are suggestive of a specific type of vaginitis. She presents with a frothy, yellowish discharge, vulvovaginal erythema, and a 'strawberry cervix,' which are classic signs of trichomoniasis. The vaginal pH is 5.8, which is elevated; normal vaginal pH is typically 3.8 to 4.5. Trichomoniasis is associated with a higher vaginal pH, usually above 4.5. Vulvovaginal candidiasis typically presents with a thick, white, ""cottage cheese"" discharge and normal vaginal pH. Atrophic vaginitis is more common in postmenopausal women and is associated with vaginal dryness and irritation. Chlamydia often presents with minimal symptoms and does not typically cause a frothy discharge or elevated vaginal pH. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is trichomoniasis.",9

1184,"The infant presents with regurgitation and vomiting shortly after feeding, which is common in infants and often due to gastroesophageal reflux (GER). The infant appears healthy, with normal weight gain and no signs of distress or complications, suggesting uncomplicated GER. In such cases, conservative management is typically recommended first. Positioning therapy, such as keeping the infant upright after feeding, is a non-invasive and simple initial approach to manage GER in infants. Other options like esophageal pH monitoring or abdominal ultrasound are more invasive or diagnostic, and pantoprazole therapy is not typically first-line for uncomplicated GER in infants.",9
1191,"The patient presents with symptoms of allergic rhinitis, which include sneezing, nasal congestion, itching, and postnasal drainage. These symptoms are consistent with seasonal allergies, likely triggered by environmental allergens. The most effective first-line treatment for moderate to severe allergic rhinitis is intranasal corticosteroids. These medications help reduce inflammation and are effective in controlling all the symptoms of allergic rhinitis, including nasal congestion, sneezing, and itching. While intranasal antihistamines can also be used, they are generally less effective than corticosteroids for nasal congestion. Intranasal cromolyn sodium is less effective and requires frequent dosing. Intranasal decongestants are not recommended for long-term use due to the risk of rebound congestion.",9
1195,"The patient presents with symptoms of chest pain, productive cough with purulent sputum, shortness of breath, and fever. These symptoms, along with the history of recent influenza, suggest a respiratory infection. The vital signs show fever and hypoxemia (SO2 80%), indicating a significant respiratory issue. The laboratory findings reveal leukocytosis with a predominance of neutrophils, which is typical for a bacterial infection. The chest X-ray shows alveolar infiltrates in the left base with air bronchograms, which are characteristic of pneumonia. Sarcoidosis typically presents with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and is not associated with purulent sputum. Lung cancer is less likely given the acute presentation and the X-ray findings. Tuberculosis usually presents with chronic symptoms and upper lobe infiltrates. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is pneumonia.",9

1312,"The patient's symptoms of postprandial abdominal pain, weight loss, and diarrhea, along with a history of smoking and cardiovascular disease, suggest chronic mesenteric ischemia. This condition is caused by atherosclerosis of the mesenteric arteries, leading to reduced blood flow to the intestines, especially after meals when demand increases. The pain after eating and weight loss due to fear of eating are classic signs. CT angiography of the abdomen is the best test to confirm this diagnosis as it can visualize the mesenteric vessels and identify any stenosis or occlusion.",9
1252,"The newborn presents with bilious vomiting, which is concerning for an intestinal obstruction. The presence of polyhydramnios on prenatal ultrasound suggests a condition that could interfere with the fetus's ability to swallow amniotic fluid, such as duodenal atresia. Duodenal atresia is commonly associated with Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). The APGAR scores and the symptoms of vomiting and dehydration further support an obstruction. The abdominal X-ray, although not visible here, would likely show the 'double bubble' sign typical of duodenal atresia. Therefore, the disorder most associated with this presentation is Trisomy 21.",9
1258,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are suggestive of internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), characterized by impaired adduction of the eye on the side of the lesion and nystagmus of the abducting eye. This condition is often due to a lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF). In a young patient, especially a woman, multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common cause of INO. To evaluate for demyelinating lesions typical of MS, an MRI of the brain is the most appropriate next step. CT scans are less sensitive for detecting demyelinating lesions, and a lumbar puncture is not the initial step for diagnosis. An ophthalmology referral is not necessary at this stage as the issue is neurological rather than ophthalmological.",9
1373,"The patient's presentation includes fatigue, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, anemia, leukocytosis, and a positive direct Coombs test. These findings are suggestive of a hematologic disorder. The positive Coombs test indicates the presence of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which is often associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The leukocyte count of 16,000/mm3 with lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly further supports CLL, as it typically presents with lymphocytosis. The age of the patient (72 years) is also consistent with CLL, which is more common in older adults. The other options, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), would present differently, with CML showing a very high leukocyte count and the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, and AML presenting with more acute symptoms and blasts in the blood smear. Follicular lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and would not typically present with a positive Coombs test or the specific blood findings seen here. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",9
1394,"The newborn in this scenario presents with central cyanosis, a continuous machine-like murmur, and echocardiographic findings consistent with transposition of the great arteries (TGA) with a ventricular septal defect (VSD). The continuous murmur suggests a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), which is common in TGA to allow mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. The large birth weight (4700 g) suggests macrosomia, which is often associated with maternal diabetes. Maternal diabetes is a known risk factor for congenital heart defects, including TGA. Therefore, further evaluation of the mother is most likely to show elevated fasting blood glucose, indicating gestational diabetes or pre-existing diabetes.",9
1400,"The symptoms and clinical presentation are consistent with a black widow spider bite. The child presents with severe muscle cramping, abdominal pain, hypertension, and tachycardia, which are characteristic of latrodectism, the syndrome caused by black widow spider envenomation. The bite often causes localized pain and erythema, and systemic symptoms can include muscle cramps, abdominal rigidity, and autonomic effects such as hypertension and tachycardia. The brown recluse spider typically causes local necrotic lesions rather than systemic symptoms. Cryptopid centipedes and ticks do not typically cause this combination of symptoms.",9
1416,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with acute uncomplicated cystitis, including dysuria, urinary frequency, suprapubic tenderness, and positive nitrites and leukocyte esterase on urinalysis. The presence of WBCs and RBCs in the urine further supports this diagnosis. Given that she is trying to conceive, it is important to choose an antibiotic that is safe for potential pregnancy. Fosfomycin is a single-dose oral antibiotic that is effective for uncomplicated urinary tract infections and is considered safe during pregnancy. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to treat her with oral fosfomycin.",9
1425,"The patient is exhibiting symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including insomnia, nightmares, avoidance of trauma-related topics, anxiety, irritability, detachment, and an exaggerated startle response. PTSD can develop after exposure to a traumatic event, such as the one described. Prophylactic treatment with certain medications immediately following a traumatic event can help prevent the development of PTSD. Prazosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist that is often used to treat PTSD-related nightmares and sleep disturbances. However, it is not typically used for prevention. Propanolol, a beta-blocker, has been studied for its potential to prevent PTSD by reducing the physiological response to stress and trauma when administered shortly after the traumatic event. Sertraline is an SSRI used to treat PTSD but is not used for prevention. Zolpidem is a sedative used for insomnia but does not prevent PTSD. Therefore, the medication that might have helped prevent this patient's current disorder is Propanolol.",9
1426,"The patient was started on sertraline, an SSRI, for symptoms suggestive of depression. SSRIs typically take 4-6 weeks to show full therapeutic effects. The patient has been on sertraline for only 2 weeks, which is not enough time to assess its full efficacy. Although he reports some improvement in sleep and appetite, he still feels fatigued and hasn't regained weight. However, these symptoms may improve with continued treatment. Changing or discontinuing the medication prematurely could prevent the patient from experiencing the full benefits of sertraline. Therefore, the most appropriate step is to continue the current medication and reassess after a sufficient period.",9

1447,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of Horner's syndrome, which is characterized by ptosis (drooping of the eyelid), miosis (constricted pupil), and anhidrosis (loss of sweating) on the affected side of the face. The combination of ptosis and miosis without ocular pain or diplopia, along with the history of smoking and weight loss, raises suspicion for a Pancoast tumor (superior sulcus tumor) affecting the sympathetic chain. This could explain the Horner's syndrome. The most likely additional clinical feature in Horner's syndrome due to a Pancoast tumor would be loss of hemifacial sweating (anhidrosis) on the affected side.",9
1207,"The infant in this scenario presents with facial abnormalities, brachydactyly, a short neck, and bilateral cataracts. These features can be associated with various teratogenic influences if they occur during pregnancy. The mother's medications and habits are key to identifying the cause. Omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, is not typically associated with these congenital anomalies. Gentamicin, an antibiotic, can affect hearing but not typically the described physical features. Alcohol use during pregnancy can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome, which causes facial abnormalities and developmental issues but not usually cataracts. Warfarin, however, is a known teratogen that can cause chondrodysplasia punctata (which affects cartilage and bone development leading to nasal hypoplasia), brachydactyly, and ophthalmologic issues such as cataracts. Considering the symptoms, Warfarin is the most likely cause.",9
1483,"The patient is experiencing pain over the Achilles tendon, which is a known side effect of fluoroquinolones like moxifloxacin. These antibiotics can increase the risk of tendonitis and tendon rupture, particularly in patients with risk factors such as diabetes. Given the acute onset of pain during physical activity and the current use of moxifloxacin, there is a concern for fluoroquinolone-induced tendinopathy or even a partial tendon tear. The best management step is to discontinue the offending agent and avoid activities that could exacerbate the condition or lead to a rupture. Therefore, changing the antibiotic and refraining from athletic activities is the most appropriate next step.",9
1527,"The patient is a 14-year-old boy with an intractable nosebleed and no history of trauma or hereditary bleeding disorders. The most common cause of nosebleeds (epistaxis) in children and adolescents is anterior epistaxis, which typically originates from the Kiesselbach plexus. This area is located in the anterior part of the nasal septum and is a common site for nosebleeds due to its rich vascular supply and exposure to environmental factors. The other options, such as the ethmoidal artery and sphenopalatine artery, are more commonly associated with posterior epistaxis, which is less common in this age group and typically more severe. The carotid artery is not directly involved in typical epistaxis cases. Given the age and presentation, the most likely etiology is bleeding from the Kiesselbach plexus.",9
1528,"The patient presents with signs of cardiac tamponade, which include Beck's triad: muffled heart sounds, distended neck veins, and hypotension. The absence of tracheal deviation and the presence of bilateral breath sounds suggest that a tension pneumothorax is unlikely. In cardiac tamponade, pulsus paradoxus is a common finding, which is characterized by a decrease in systolic blood pressure of more than 10 mmHg during inspiration. This is due to the impaired filling of the right ventricle during inspiration, leading to decreased left ventricular output and thus a drop in systolic blood pressure. Therefore, the expected additional finding is a decrease in systolic blood pressure with inspiration.",9
1557,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with rabies infection, which is transmitted through bites from infected animals such as bats. The symptoms of fever, photophobia, and irritability align with the neurological manifestations of rabies. In rabies, post-mortem examination of the brain tissue typically reveals Negri bodies, which are eosinophilic, cytoplasmic inclusions found in neurons, particularly in the hippocampus and cerebellum. These are pathognomonic for rabies infection.",10
1565,"The patient exhibits symptoms of psychosis, including delusions (belief that the NSA is spying on him and controlling his mind), disorganized speech, and bizarre behavior. These symptoms have been present for 6 weeks. Additionally, he has shown signs of social withdrawal and depression for the past 3 months. 

To differentiate between the disorders:

- **Schizophreniform disorder** requires symptoms lasting more than 1 month but less than 6 months.
- **Schizophrenia** requires symptoms lasting more than 6 months.
- **Brief psychotic disorder** involves symptoms lasting less than 1 month.
- **Schizotypal personality disorder** involves a pervasive pattern of social and interpersonal deficits, but not the acute psychotic symptoms seen here.

Given that the symptoms have been present for 6 weeks, the most appropriate diagnosis is schizophreniform disorder, as it fits the duration criteria.",9
1599,"The clinical presentation of this 12-month-old boy, including recurrent infections, particularly with Burkholderia cepacia, and the negative nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test, suggests a diagnosis of Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD). CGD is caused by a defect in the NADPH oxidase complex, which is responsible for producing reactive oxygen species in neutrophils. The inability to produce these reactive oxygen species leads to impaired killing of certain bacteria and fungi, resulting in recurrent infections. The NBT test is used to assess the function of the NADPH oxidase complex; a negative test (neutrophils remain colorless) indicates a defect in this complex.",9
1566,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with asthma, including daily symptoms, nighttime awakenings, and improvement in FEV1 with albuterol, indicating reversible airway obstruction. According to asthma management guidelines, his symptoms suggest moderate persistent asthma. The appropriate step for managing moderate persistent asthma is to start with a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA). This combination helps control inflammation and provides long-term bronchodilation. A long-acting beta-agonist alone is not recommended due to the risk of worsening asthma control without an anti-inflammatory agent. Medium or high-dose ICS with LABA is typically reserved for more severe cases or if control is not achieved with lower doses.",9
1635,"The patient's symptoms, including frontal balding, muscle wasting, testicular atrophy, and cardiac conduction issues, suggest myotonic dystrophy. This condition is known for genetic anticipation, where symptoms appear at an earlier age and with increased severity in successive generations. The father's early-onset balding and cataracts, without cardiac disease, indicate a milder form of the condition compared to the son, who presents with more severe symptoms, including third-degree AV block. This pattern is characteristic of anticipation, where the number of trinucleotide repeats increases in successive generations, leading to more severe manifestations.",9
1471,,0
1640,"The patient presents with hyponatremia (serum Na+ of 130 mEq/L) and a high urine sodium concentration (320 mEq/L/24 hours), which suggests the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). SIADH is characterized by euvolemic hyponatremia, where the body retains water but not sodium, leading to dilutional hyponatremia. The patient's vital signs and lab values do not indicate hypovolemia or hypervolemia, supporting a diagnosis of SIADH. The best initial management for SIADH is fluid restriction to reduce water intake and correct the hyponatremia.",9
1649,"This patient is likely experiencing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), given his history of type I diabetes, altered mental status, high blood glucose level, and metabolic acidosis (low bicarbonate level). In DKA, the primary issue is the accumulation of ketones leading to an anion gap metabolic acidosis. The treatment involves fluid resuscitation, insulin therapy, and electrolyte management. The appropriate endpoint of treatment for DKA is the closure of the anion gap, indicating that the ketoacidosis has resolved. While normalizing glucose is important, it is not the primary endpoint, as glucose levels can be managed separately with insulin. Therefore, the correct endpoint of treatment is a normal anion gap.",9
1749,"The patient has recently started a new blood pressure medication and now presents with acute renal failure, as indicated by the significant increase in creatinine levels. The MRA shows bilateral renal artery stenosis. In patients with renal artery stenosis, the kidneys rely on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to maintain glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, like captopril, block the formation of angiotensin II, which is necessary to constrict the efferent arterioles of the glomeruli and maintain GFR. In the presence of renal artery stenosis, this can lead to a significant drop in GFR and acute renal failure. Therefore, the new medication that likely caused the acute renal failure is captopril.",9
1430,,0
1741,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of a gynecological emergency, likely involving the adnexa given the right lower quadrant pain and adnexal tenderness. The negative pregnancy test rules out an ectopic pregnancy, which would have been suggested by an echogenic tubal ring (A). The sudden onset of pain after intercourse, along with severe tenderness and guarding, suggests a possible ovarian torsion, which would be indicated by decreased ovarian blood flow on Doppler (B). A complex, echogenic intrauterine mass (C) would suggest a uterine issue, such as a fibroid or retained products of conception, which is not consistent with the presentation. A distended fallopian tube with incomplete septations (D) suggests hydrosalpinx, which is less likely to cause acute severe pain and is not typically associated with sudden onset after intercourse. Given the acute presentation and adnexal tenderness, ovarian torsion is the most likely diagnosis, making decreased ovarian blood flow on Doppler the expected finding.",9
1785,"The patient has a history of occupational exposure to dyes, which is a risk factor for bladder cancer. The presence of a 3-cm mass in the bladder mucosa that is pathologically confirmed as urothelial carcinoma with penetration into the muscular layer indicates muscle-invasive bladder cancer. For muscle-invasive bladder cancer, the standard treatment is radical cystectomy, especially since imaging shows no evidence of metastasis or lymph node involvement. Transurethral resection with intravesical chemotherapy is typically used for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Radiation therapy and palliative chemotherapy are not first-line treatments for muscle-invasive bladder cancer without metastasis.",9
1621,"The patient's symptoms of excessive thirst and urination, along with the history of lithium use, suggest nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Lithium can impair the kidney's ability to concentrate urine, leading to increased excretion of dilute urine. The low urinary specific gravity and low urinary osmolality confirm this diagnosis. In nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, there is a loss of free water, leading to increased serum osmolality. As a result, the intracellular fluid (ICF) volume decreases due to water shifting out of cells to maintain osmotic balance, while the extracellular fluid (ECF) volume also decreases due to water loss, but to a lesser extent than the ICF. Therefore, the Darrow-Yannet diagram should show decreased ECF and ICF volumes with increased osmolality.",9
1789,"The patient's symptoms and the auscultation findings suggest aortic regurgitation. The early diastolic decrescendo blowing murmur along the left sternal border is characteristic of this condition. In the United States, the most common cause of aortic regurgitation in a relatively young adult is a congenital bicuspid aortic valve. While syphilis and connective tissue diseases can also cause aortic regurgitation, they are less common causes in this demographic. Myxomatous degeneration is more associated with mitral valve prolapse rather than aortic regurgitation.",9
1791,"The patient has a defect in IL-12 receptor signaling, which is crucial for the differentiation of naive T cells into Th1 cells. Th1 cells are important for the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), a cytokine that activates macrophages and is critical in the immune response against intracellular pathogens like Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Since the patient has impaired Th1 development, providing exogenous IFN-γ can help compensate for the lack of endogenous production and enhance the immune response against the tuberculosis infection.",9
1795,"The patient is experiencing profuse vaginal hemorrhage immediately after delivery of the placenta, which suggests a problem with placental separation or uterine contraction. Her history of a previous cesarean section increases the risk of abnormal placental attachment in subsequent pregnancies. The options provided relate to different types of abnormal placental attachment or location. 

A. Chorionic villi attaching to the decidua basalis describes normal placental attachment, which would not cause hemorrhage.

B. Chorionic villi attaching to the myometrium describes placenta accreta, where the placenta attaches too deeply into the uterine wall, preventing normal separation after delivery and leading to hemorrhage.

C. Chorionic villi invading into the myometrium describes placenta increta, a more severe form of abnormal attachment than accreta, also causing significant hemorrhage.

D. Placental implantation over the internal cervical os describes placenta previa, which typically causes painless bleeding before delivery, not immediately after.

Given the history of cesarean section and the immediate postpartum hemorrhage, placenta accreta (option B) is the most likely cause.",9

1796,"To calculate the loading dose, we use the formula: \( \text{Loading Dose} = \text{Volume of Distribution (Vd)} \times \text{Target Concentration} \). First, we need to determine the Volume of Distribution (Vd) from the provided data.\n\nFor the subject with a weight of 100 kg:\n\n- Dose provided = 1500 mg\n- Serum concentration = 15 mg/dL\n\nThe formula for Vd is: \( \text{Vd} = \frac{\text{Dose}}{\text{Concentration}} \).\n\nConvert the concentration from mg/dL to mg/L (since 1 dL = 0.1 L):\n\n- 15 mg/dL = 150 mg/L\n\nNow calculate Vd:\n\n\( \text{Vd} = \frac{1500 \text{ mg}}{150 \text{ mg/L}} = 10 \text{ L} \)\n\nAssuming Vd is proportional to body weight, for the patient with a weight of 60 kg, the Vd would be:\n\n\( \text{Vd for 60 kg} = \frac{60}{100} \times 10 \text{ L} = 6 \text{ L} \)\n\nNow calculate the loading dose for the target concentration of 10 mg/dL (which is 100 mg/L):\n\n\( \text{Loading Dose} = 6 \text{ L} \times 100 \text{ mg/L} = 600 \text{ mg} \)\n\nTherefore, the loading dose for the patient should be 600 mg.",9
1799,"The scenario describes the physiological process of receptive relaxation, where the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and the orad stomach relax in response to the distension of the esophagus by a food bolus. This process is part of the enteric nervous system's coordination to allow the passage of food into the stomach. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) is a neurotransmitter that is known to mediate smooth muscle relaxation in the gastrointestinal tract, including the relaxation of the LES and the stomach. Therefore, VIP is the most likely substance involved in this process.",9
1801,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a condition associated with neural tube defects. The sac-like protuberance removed at birth likely indicates a myelomeningocele, which is commonly associated with Chiari II malformation. The symptoms of progressive headache, neck pain, dizziness, and tingling sensations in the arms and hands can be explained by the downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils and brainstem through the foramen magnum, characteristic of Chiari II malformation. This can lead to compression of neural structures and result in the symptoms described. Additionally, the bilateral optic disk swelling (papilledema) suggests increased intracranial pressure, which can occur with Chiari malformations. The sensorineural hearing loss is not typical for Chiari II malformation, but the other symptoms and history strongly point towards this diagnosis. Vestibular schwannoma typically causes unilateral hearing loss and is associated with neurofibromatosis type 2, which does not fit this patient's history. Medulloblastoma and intraventricular hemorrhage are less consistent with the patient's age, history, and symptomatology.",9
1805,"The patient is likely experiencing an acute ischemic stroke, given the sudden onset of slurred speech and difficulty using her fork, which suggests motor and speech deficits. She was brought to the emergency department within 1 hour of symptom onset, allowing for the administration of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a thrombolytic agent used to dissolve clots in ischemic strokes. However, her condition worsened an hour later, indicating a possible complication such as hemorrhagic transformation, a known risk of tPA. In the event of hemorrhagic transformation, the use of aminocaproic acid, an antifibrinolytic agent, can help counteract the effects of tPA by promoting clot stability and reducing bleeding. Therefore, the appropriate agent to use at this point is aminocaproic acid.",9
1806,"The clinical presentation of recurrent sinus and upper respiratory infections, along with recurrent diarrhea, suggests a possible immunodeficiency. The laboratory finding of abnormally low levels of one immunoglobulin isotype with normal levels of others is key. Selective IgA deficiency is characterized by low or absent IgA levels while other immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgM) remain normal. This condition often presents with recurrent mucosal infections, such as sinusitis and gastrointestinal issues, due to the role of IgA in mucosal immunity. The other options do not fit as well: Chediak-Higashi syndrome involves albinism and neurological issues; Common variable immunodeficiency typically affects more than one immunoglobulin isotype; and drug-induced IgA deficiency would require a history of drug use causing the deficiency.",9

1809,"The patient is presenting with symptoms suggestive of an acute exacerbation of COPD, likely due to an infection given the fever and productive cough with yellow sputum. The presence of bilateral crackles and wheezes, along with the fever, suggests a possible pneumonia or other pulmonary infection. In such cases, the next step in management is to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of lung involvement. A chest X-ray is the most appropriate initial imaging study to evaluate for pneumonia, assess the severity of the exacerbation, and rule out other potential causes of the symptoms such as a pneumothorax or heart failure. CT scan, bronchoscopy, and bronchoprovocation test are not indicated as the immediate next step in this scenario.",9
1813,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest the presence of uric acid stones. She has a history of gout, which is associated with hyperuricemia and can lead to the formation of uric acid stones. These stones typically have low Hounsfield unit values on CT scans. Uric acid stones are more likely to form in acidic urine, as uric acid is less soluble in acidic conditions. Therefore, the urinalysis is most likely to show acidic urine.",9

1808,"The pleural fluid analysis shows a pleural fluid to serum protein ratio of 0.35 and a pleural fluid to serum LDH ratio of 0.49. According to Light's criteria, a pleural effusion is classified as an exudate if any of the following are true: pleural fluid protein/serum protein ratio > 0.5, pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH ratio > 0.6, or pleural fluid LDH > two-thirds the upper limit of normal for serum LDH. In this case, none of these criteria are met, indicating a transudative effusion.

Transudative effusions are typically caused by systemic factors that alter the balance of hydrostatic and oncotic pressures, such as congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, or nephrotic syndrome. The patient's presentation with shortness of breath, right-sided chest pain, and the characteristics of the pleural fluid suggest a transudative effusion, which is most commonly associated with congestive heart failure.

Chylothorax (A) would typically present with a milky fluid due to the presence of chyle. Uremia (B) and sarcoidosis (C) are more likely to cause exudative effusions. Therefore, the most likely disorder in this patient is congestive heart failure.",9
1820,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of erythema nodosum, characterized by painful red nodules on the legs, often associated with systemic symptoms like malaise and joint pain. Erythema nodosum can be associated with various conditions, including infections, medications, and systemic diseases. Given the patient's age and symptoms, one common association is sarcoidosis, which often presents with erythema nodosum and can be accompanied by hilar lymphadenopathy. A chest X-ray is a non-invasive and appropriate next step to evaluate for sarcoidosis or other pulmonary conditions that might be associated with erythema nodosum.",9
1822,"Fetal myelopoiesis, or the production of blood cells, occurs in different locations during various stages of development. Initially, in the early weeks of gestation, the yolk sac is the primary site of hematopoiesis. As development progresses, the liver becomes the main site of hematopoiesis from around 6 weeks to mid-gestation. By the 22nd week of gestation, the liver is still the primary site of fetal myelopoiesis, although the bone marrow is beginning to take over this function as the pregnancy progresses further. The aorta-gonad-mesonephros region is involved in early hematopoiesis but not at this stage. The spleen also contributes to hematopoiesis but is not the primary site at 22 weeks. Therefore, at 22 weeks of gestation, the liver remains the primary location for fetal myelopoiesis.",9
1821,"The child's symptoms of chronic diarrhea with frothy, foul-smelling stools, recurrent respiratory infections, and failure to thrive suggest malabsorption and possible pancreatic insufficiency. These symptoms are characteristic of cystic fibrosis, which is caused by a faulty transmembrane ion channel, specifically the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) protein. This defect leads to thick mucus production affecting the lungs and digestive system, causing recurrent respiratory infections and malabsorption due to pancreatic enzyme deficiency.",9
1827,"The patient has an elevated LDL cholesterol level of 203 mg/dL, which is significantly above the recommended target. The HDL is low at 37 mg/dL, and triglycerides are elevated at 292 mg/dL. The primary goal in managing dyslipidemia is to lower LDL cholesterol, especially when it is markedly elevated as in this case. Statins are the first-line treatment for lowering LDL cholesterol. Among the options, atorvastatin 40 mg is a high-intensity statin that would be appropriate for significantly lowering LDL levels. Simvastatin 10 mg is a low-intensity statin and would not be sufficient for this level of LDL elevation. Ezetimibe is typically used as an adjunct to statins when further LDL reduction is needed. Fenofibrate is primarily used for lowering triglycerides and would not be the first choice here. Therefore, atorvastatin 40 mg is the most appropriate choice to initiate treatment for this patient.",9
1829,"The clinical presentation of the patient, including failure to thrive, developmental delay, coarse facial features, restricted joint mobility, and increased plasma levels of several enzymes, is suggestive of I-cell disease (mucolipidosis II). This condition is caused by a defect in the phosphorylation of mannose residues on lysosomal enzymes. Normally, these enzymes are tagged with mannose-6-phosphate in the Golgi apparatus, which directs them to the lysosomes. In I-cell disease, there is a failure of mannose phosphorylation due to a deficiency in the enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase. As a result, lysosomal enzymes are secreted into the extracellular space instead of being targeted to the lysosomes, leading to the accumulation of undegraded substrates in lysosomes and the clinical manifestations observed.",9
1828,"The patient presents with acute onset right-sided weakness and slurred speech, suggesting a possible stroke. He has risk factors including hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and smoking. The irregular pulse indicates atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of embolic stroke. The CT scan is likely performed to rule out hemorrhage. Since the patient is on rivaroxaban, a direct oral anticoagulant, thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is contraindicated due to the increased risk of bleeding. Aspirin is not appropriate in the acute setting of a potential embolic stroke when the patient is already anticoagulated. Heparin is not indicated in acute ischemic stroke management. Metoprolol is not relevant to acute stroke management. Therefore, none of the options are appropriate, but if forced to choose, aspirin would be the least harmful option, though not ideal.",9
1817,"tRNA molecules have a specific structure that includes an anticodon loop and an acceptor stem. The acceptor stem is the site where the amino acid binds. This is located at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule. In diagrams, this is typically shown at the top of the cloverleaf structure, often labeled as the site where the amino acid attaches.",9
1835,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a severe mucocutaneous reaction often triggered by medications such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The key features include painful oral lesions, a rash with vesicles and bullae, and ocular involvement. The skin lesions are characterized by target-like lesions and sloughing of the epidermis. To confirm the diagnosis of SJS, a biopsy and histopathologic analysis of the skin lesions would be most appropriate. This would show necrosis of the epidermis and subepidermal bullae, which are characteristic findings in SJS.",9
1832,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The key findings include leukocytosis, low LAP score, and the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1 gene), which is characteristic of CML. The best treatment for CML, especially in the chronic phase, is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the BCR-ABL fusion protein produced by the Philadelphia chromosome. Imatinib is the first-line treatment for CML as it specifically inhibits the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, leading to remission in most patients.",9
1831,"The patient has prostate cancer with metastasis to the bone, as indicated by the osteoblastic lesions. The treatment strategy for metastatic prostate cancer often involves androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) because prostate cancer growth is typically driven by androgens. The drug mentioned in the question competes with androgens for interaction with testosterone receptors, which describes an anti-androgen. Among the options, Flutamide is an anti-androgen that directly competes with androgens at the receptor level. Leuprolide and Degarelix are GnRH analogs/antagonists that reduce androgen production but do not directly compete at the receptor. Docetaxel is a chemotherapy agent and does not fit the description. Therefore, the drug initiated is Flutamide.",9
1836,"The clinical presentation of this 2-year-old boy suggests a primary immunodeficiency. The recurrent infections, including respiratory tract infections, oral thrush, and chronic diarrhea, along with failure to thrive, are indicative of a severe immunodeficiency. The facial dysmorphisms (prominent nasal bridge, hypoplastic wing of the nose, shortened chin, and dysplastic ears) are suggestive of DiGeorge syndrome, which is associated with thymic aplasia or hypoplasia leading to T cell deficiency. The positive RSV test and the respiratory symptoms align with a viral infection, which individuals with T cell deficiencies are particularly susceptible to. Therefore, the most likely deficiency in this patient is T cells.",9
1840,"The patient's symptoms of amenorrhea and decreased peripheral vision suggest a possible pituitary adenoma, specifically a prolactinoma. Prolactinomas can cause hyperprolactinemia, leading to amenorrhea due to inhibition of GnRH and subsequent decrease in LH and FSH. The mass effect of the adenoma can compress the optic chiasm, causing bitemporal hemianopsia (decreased peripheral vision). Hyperprolactinemia can also lead to decreased estrogen levels, which over time can result in decreased bone density due to reduced bone mineralization. Therefore, decreased bone density is a likely physical finding in this scenario.",9
1833,"The patient presents with sudden onset of weakness in the left upper and lower extremities, inability to plantarflex the ankle while supine, and an unsteady gait. However, her imaging studies (CT and MRI of the brain, MR angiography) show no abnormalities, which rules out an acute hemorrhagic stroke (D). The presence of anxiety and recent job loss suggests psychological stressors. Conversion disorder (A) involves neurological symptoms that cannot be explained by medical evaluation and are often associated with psychological factors. Malingering (B) involves intentional production of symptoms for external gain, which is not suggested by the scenario. Somatic symptom disorder (C) involves excessive focus on physical symptoms, but typically these are chronic and not associated with neurological deficits. Given the acute presentation and lack of organic findings, conversion disorder is the most likely diagnosis.",9
1844,"The clinical presentation described is consistent with Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSSS), which is caused by the exfoliative toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus. The key features include a peeling erythematous rash, tenderness, and desquamation, along with a positive Nikolsky's sign (epidermis separates from the dermis with gentle pressure). The age of the patient and the rapid progression of symptoms also support this diagnosis. Other options like Bacillus anthracis, Clostridium sp., and Streptococcus sp. do not typically present with these specific symptoms in this age group.",9
1837,"The greater curvature of the stomach receives its blood supply primarily from the gastroepiploic arteries. The right gastroepiploic artery, which is a branch of the gastroduodenal artery (itself a branch of the common hepatic artery), supplies the right half of the greater curvature of the stomach. The left gastroepiploic artery, a branch of the splenic artery, supplies the left half of the greater curvature. Therefore, for the right half of the greater curvature, the right gastroepiploic artery is the direct source of blood supply.",9
1847,"The patient is presenting with symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), including high blood glucose, elevated serum ketones, fruity breath, and altered mental status. DKA is a medical emergency that requires prompt treatment. The primary management involves rehydration with intravenous fluids and administration of insulin to reduce blood glucose and ketone levels. The options involving discontinuation of metformin or sitagliptin are not applicable here, as there is no indication that the patient is currently on these medications, nor are they relevant to the acute management of DKA. Therefore, the next best step in management is to administer IV fluids and insulin.",9
1850,"Sitagliptin is a medication used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. It belongs to a class of drugs known as DPP-4 inhibitors. The primary mechanism of action of sitagliptin is to inhibit the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). This enzyme is responsible for the degradation of incretin hormones such as GLP-1 and GIP. By inhibiting DPP-4, sitagliptin increases the levels of these incretin hormones, which in turn enhance insulin secretion in response to meals and decrease glucagon levels, thereby improving blood glucose control. Therefore, the direct mechanism of action of sitagliptin is to inhibit the degradation of endogenous incretins.",9
1849,"The patient presents with fatigue, pallor, and a history of recent travel, along with laboratory findings indicating microcytic anemia (low MCV), low iron, and low ferritin levels, which are consistent with iron deficiency anemia. The travel history raises suspicion for a parasitic infection that could cause blood loss, leading to iron deficiency. Nematodes, such as hookworms, can cause chronic blood loss by attaching to the intestinal wall and feeding on blood, leading to iron deficiency anemia. This matches the laboratory findings and clinical presentation. Other options, such as viruses or mosquito-borne protozoa, do not typically cause iron deficiency anemia through blood loss.",9
1852,"The patient is experiencing an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), as indicated by the ST elevations in leads I, aVL, and V5-6. In the setting of a STEMI, antiplatelet therapy is crucial to prevent further thrombus formation. While aspirin is typically given, this patient has an allergy to aspirin. The next best antiplatelet agent is an ADP receptor inhibitor, such as clopidogrel, which works by inhibiting the P2Y12 component of ADP receptors on the platelet surface, thereby preventing platelet aggregation. This mechanism is distinct from aspirin, which inhibits cyclooxygenase. Therefore, the mechanism of the next medication that should be given is ADP receptor inhibition.",9
1851,"The patient presents with unilateral leg pain and swelling, which are classic signs of a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). The physical examination reveals a significant difference in calf circumference and pitting edema, which further supports this suspicion. The presence of superficial dilated veins can occur due to increased venous pressure from a DVT. The key diagnostic finding is the venous duplex ultrasound showing an inability to fully compress the lumen of the profunda femoris vein, which is indicative of a thrombus in the deep venous system. Superficial venous thrombophlebitis typically involves superficial veins and would not show non-compressibility of a deep vein on ultrasound. Erythema nodosum presents with painful nodules, not swelling and non-compressible veins. A ruptured popliteal cyst would typically present with posterior knee pain and swelling, not the findings described here. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is deep venous thrombosis.",9
1854,"The patient's symptoms and family history suggest a hereditary condition. The headaches, blurry vision, and vomiting are indicative of increased intracranial pressure, likely due to a mass. The fundoscopic findings of optic disc swelling and capillary vessel growth in the retina suggest retinal hemangioblastomas, which are associated with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. The infratentorial mass seen on MRI is consistent with a cerebellar tumor. In VHL disease, cerebellar hemangioblastomas are common. The family history of renal cell carcinoma at a young age further supports VHL disease, as this condition is associated with both renal cell carcinoma and hemangioblastomas. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for the infratentorial mass is a hemangioblastoma.",9
1855,"Fluphenazine is a typical antipsychotic that can cause extrapyramidal side effects due to dopamine blockade. The side effects include acute dystonia, akathisia, parkinsonism, and tardive dyskinesia. Tardive dyskinesia is characterized by involuntary, repetitive movements, often involving the face, such as lip-smacking or tongue movements. It is a concern because it can become irreversible if the medication is not discontinued. The psychiatrist's statement about the side effect becoming irreversible suggests tardive dyskinesia. The choreoathetoid movements of the face are indicative of tardive dyskinesia.",9
1859,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of a systemic vasculitis. Key features include asthma, eosinophilia (29%), neuropathy (foot drop and sensory changes), skin lesions (tender nodules and palpable purpura), and renal involvement (hematuria and proteinuria). These findings are characteristic of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome. EGPA is associated with asthma, eosinophilia, and systemic vasculitis affecting multiple organs, including the skin, peripheral nerves, and kidneys. The presence of asthma and high eosinophil count are particularly indicative of EGPA.",9
1860,"Coagulation necrosis is a type of tissue necrosis where the architecture of the tissue is preserved for a few days after cell death. This occurs because the denaturation of proteins, including enzymes, prevents proteolysis of the dead cells. This is in contrast to liquefactive necrosis, where hydrolytic enzymes lead to the digestion of tissue, resulting in a liquid mass. Coagulation necrosis is typically seen in ischemic conditions, such as myocardial infarction, but not in the brain, where ischemia leads to liquefactive necrosis. Acute pancreatic necrosis is associated with enzymatic fat necrosis, not coagulation necrosis. Therefore, coagulation necrosis is characterized by the preservation of cellular shape.",9
1862,"During pregnancy, there is an increase in estrogen levels, which leads to an increase in thyroid-binding globulin (TBG). This increase in TBG results in higher total levels of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) because more hormone is bound to the increased TBG. However, the free hormone levels (free T3 and free T4) remain normal because the body maintains a euthyroid state by adjusting hormone production. Therefore, in a pregnant woman, we expect to see increased TBG, normal free T3 and T4, and increased total T3 and T4.",9
1866,"The patient's symptoms suggest a progressive neurological disorder affecting both the upper and lower motor neurons, as well as sensory pathways. The key features include:

- Progressive weakness starting in the right upper extremity and spreading to other limbs.
- Neck pain exacerbated by coughing or sneezing, suggesting increased intracranial pressure or spinal cord involvement.
- Dysarthria and difficulty swallowing, indicating possible brainstem involvement.
- Ataxic gait, spasticity, and hyperreflexia (4+ deep tendon reflexes) suggest upper motor neuron involvement.
- Bilateral atrophy of the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles, indicating lower motor neuron involvement or cranial nerve involvement.
- Decreased sensation below the C5 dermatome, suggesting a lesion affecting the cervical spinal cord.

The combination of these symptoms, particularly the pattern of weakness and sensory loss, points towards a compressive lesion at the foramen magnum, such as a meningioma. This would explain the involvement of both the spinal cord and lower cranial nerves, leading to the observed symptoms.",9
1865,"Prevalence is the total number of cases (new and existing) at a specific time point divided by the total population. Incidence is the number of new cases during a specific time period. 

At t = 0 months, there are 10 cases. 
At t = 1 month, 4 new cases are added, so total cases = 10 + 4 = 14.
At t = 2 months, 2 new cases are added, so total cases = 14 + 2 = 16.
At t = 3 months, 5 new cases are added, so total cases = 16 + 5 = 21.
At t = 4 months, 4 new cases are added, so total cases = 21 + 4 = 25.

A. At t = 2 months, there are 16 cases out of 100, so prevalence = 16%. 
B. At t = 3 months, there are 21 cases out of 100, so prevalence = 21%.
C. At t = 2 months, prevalence is 16% and incidence is 2%, so they are not equal.
D. At the conclusion of the study (t = 4 months), there are 25 cases out of 100, so prevalence = 25%.",9
1874,"The ultrasound findings indicate asymmetrical intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), characterized by reduced liver volume and subcutaneous fat with relative sparing of the head. This pattern suggests that the fetus is experiencing nutritional or oxygen deprivation later in pregnancy, leading to preferential blood flow to the brain (brain-sparing effect). Asymmetrical IUGR is often associated with placental insufficiency, which can be caused by maternal factors such as cigarette smoking. Cigarette smoking leads to vasoconstriction and reduced placental blood flow, contributing to the observed growth restriction pattern. Aneuploidy, fetal congenital heart disease, and fetal infection are more commonly associated with symmetrical IUGR, where the entire fetus is uniformly small.",9
1876,"The patient has a history of colorectal adenocarcinoma and presents with new lung nodules, suggesting possible metastatic disease. Colorectal adenocarcinoma commonly metastasizes to the liver and lungs. The histological appearance of metastatic colorectal cancer in the lungs would typically show glandular structures, as adenocarcinomas form glands. The presence of mucin-producing glands is characteristic of adenocarcinomas, including those originating from the colon. Therefore, the biopsy of the lung nodules would most likely reveal mucin-producing glands, consistent with metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma.",9
1869,"The patient has a history of chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis, which are risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The presentation of a liver mass with elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is suggestive of HCC. In HCC, the tumor arises from hepatocytes. Liver biopsy is not always required for diagnosis if imaging and AFP levels are consistent with HCC. The mass does not arise from bile duct epithelium, which would suggest cholangiocarcinoma. Daughter cysts are associated with hydatid cysts, not HCC.",9
1879,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings are suggestive of Paget's disease of bone. The patient has bone pain, hearing loss, and radiographic findings of expanded bony cortices and coarsened trabeculae, which are characteristic of Paget's disease. The isolated elevation in alkaline phosphatase with normal calcium and phosphate levels further supports this diagnosis. Histologically, Paget's disease is characterized by a mosaic pattern of lamellar bone with irregular cement lines, but during the active phase, there is increased osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity leading to the formation of immature woven bone. Therefore, the histologic finding most likely to be seen is immature woven bone with collagen fibers arranged irregularly.",9
1878,"The patient is a 48-year-old woman who smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day and expresses a desire to quit. Smoking cessation is a priority due to the significant health risks associated with smoking. While she also wants to lose weight and has a family history of colon cancer, her BMI is normal at 23 kg/m^2, and she is not yet due for a routine colonoscopy (typically recommended starting at age 50 for average-risk individuals). Therefore, addressing her smoking habit is the most immediate concern. Bupropion and varenicline are both effective smoking cessation aids. However, varenicline combined with nicotine replacement therapy (such as nicotine gum) is often more effective than bupropion alone. Therefore, the most appropriate initial intervention is to provide varenicline and nicotine gum to help her quit smoking.",9
1890,"The patient's symptoms and history are indicative of borderline personality disorder (BPD). She has a pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships, marked by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation, which is a hallmark of BPD. Her impulsive behavior, such as shopping and making big purchases, and her feelings of emptiness and abandonment further support this diagnosis. The presence of self-harm, as evidenced by the lacerations, is also common in BPD. Her reaction to the physicians and nurses, where she idealizes one group and devalues another, is consistent with the splitting behavior seen in BPD. These features align with BPD rather than major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, or factitious disorder.",9
1887,"Chlorpromazine is a typical antipsychotic medication that has been associated with certain ocular side effects. One of the known side effects of long-term use of chlorpromazine is the development of corneal deposits. These deposits are typically seen as brownish or grayish deposits on the cornea and can lead to vision changes. The other options listed, such as retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma, and retinal hemorrhage, are not commonly associated with chlorpromazine use. Therefore, the most likely finding on ophthalmoscopy in this patient, given his long-term use of chlorpromazine, would be corneal deposits.",9
1899,"Opiates, such as oxycodone, are known to cause constipation as a side effect. This occurs because opiates bind to opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, which leads to increased absorption of fluids from the intestinal lumen, resulting in harder stools. Additionally, opiates decrease gastrointestinal motility by reducing peristalsis, which further contributes to constipation. Therefore, the correct mechanism by which opiates cause constipation is by increasing fluid absorption from the intestinal lumen, leading to harder stools.",9
1901,"The patient has stage IV colorectal cancer with liver metastases and is being treated with palliative chemotherapy. The monoclonal antibody used in the regimen inhibits a protein responsible for epithelial cell proliferation and organogenesis. Among the options, EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) is a protein that, when activated by its ligand, promotes cell proliferation and survival. Monoclonal antibodies like cetuximab and panitumumab target EGFR to inhibit tumor growth in colorectal cancer. ALK is associated with certain lung cancers, TNF-α is involved in inflammation, and CD52 is targeted in certain leukemias and lymphomas. Therefore, the protein most likely inhibited by the drug in this context is EGFR.",9
1894,"The patient presents with sudden, painless loss of vision in the right eye, which is a key feature of central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). The fundoscopic examination reveals a pale retina with a 'cherry-red spot' at the macula, which is characteristic of CRAO. The absence of a direct pupillary reflex in the right eye and the presence of a brisk indirect reflex (relative afferent pupillary defect) further support this diagnosis. The patient's history of cardiovascular disease and risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes also align with the risk profile for CRAO. Other options like acute angle-closure glaucoma would present with eye pain and increased intraocular pressure, which are not present here. Central serous retinopathy and vitreous hemorrhage would not present with the described fundoscopic findings.",9
1902,"The 9-year-old girl is showing signs of puberty, including breast development and pubic hair growth. The breast development described corresponds to Tanner stage 3, and the presence of axillary and pubic hair indicates adrenarche. These changes are consistent with normal physiological development for her age. Precocious puberty is defined as the onset of secondary sexual characteristics before age 8 in girls, but since she is 9, this is within the normal range. There is no indication of pathological causes such as a hypothalamic hamartoma (which would cause central precocious puberty), a mosaic G-protein mutation (associated with McCune-Albright syndrome), or an ovarian cyst (which could cause peripheral precocious puberty). Therefore, the most likely cause of these findings is normal physiological development.",9
1904,"The infant presents with abdominal distension, fever, lethargy, and decreased urine output, which are concerning for a possible urinary tract obstruction or infection. In a neonate, these symptoms can indicate a condition like posterior urethral valves or another form of urinary obstruction. The best initial step in management is to relieve any potential obstruction and assess the urinary system. Urinary catheterization is a quick and effective way to decompress the bladder and obtain a urine sample for analysis, which can help in diagnosing the underlying issue.",9
1905,"The patient was treated with an anticoagulant and developed significant bleeding, which was reversed with protamine. Protamine sulfate is a specific antidote for heparin, effectively reversing its anticoagulant effects. While enoxaparin (a low molecular weight heparin) can also be partially reversed by protamine, the question states that the effects were 'virtually completely reversed,' which is more characteristic of unfractionated heparin. Warfarin is reversed with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma, not protamine. Dabigatran is reversed with idarucizumab, not protamine. Therefore, the anticoagulant administered was most likely heparin.",9
1906,"N-acetylglutamate synthase is an enzyme that produces N-acetylglutamate, which is an essential allosteric activator of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS I). CPS I is the first enzyme in the urea cycle and is responsible for converting ammonia and bicarbonate into carbamoyl phosphate. A deficiency in N-acetylglutamate synthase leads to a lack of N-acetylglutamate, resulting in decreased activity of CPS I. This causes an accumulation of ammonia, as seen in this patient. Therefore, the enzyme directly affected by the deficiency of N-acetylglutamate synthase is carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I.",9
1917,"The patient's symptoms and occupation suggest possible organophosphate poisoning, which is common in landscapers due to exposure to pesticides. The symptoms of salivation, sweating, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, miosis, rhinorrhea, wheezing, and muscle fasciculations are consistent with cholinergic toxicity. Organophosphates inhibit acetylcholinesterase, leading to an accumulation of acetylcholine and overstimulation of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. The treatment for organophosphate poisoning includes atropine, which is an antimuscarinic agent that can counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. Pralidoxime can also be used to regenerate acetylcholinesterase, but atropine is the immediate treatment to alleviate symptoms.",9
1918,"The negative predictive value (NPV) of a test is the probability that a person with a negative test result truly does not have the disease. NPV is influenced by the prevalence of the disease in the population being tested. Specifically, NPV is higher when the prevalence of the disease is lower. This is because, with fewer true cases in the population, a negative result is more likely to be a true negative. Conversely, if the prevalence of the disease increases, the NPV decreases because there are more true cases, making a negative result less likely to be a true negative. Therefore, decreasing the prevalence of HIV in the tested population would increase the NPV of the test.",9
1919,"The patient's sudden, painless loss of vision in one eye, along with her history of uncontrolled hypertension and angina, suggests a vascular cause. The fundus examination shows generalized pallor and slight disc edema without hemorrhages, which is consistent with ischemia. Retinal detachment typically presents with flashes, floaters, or a curtain-like shadow, which the patient denies. Temporal arteritis (inflammation of the temporal artery) usually presents with headache, jaw claudication, and elevated ESR, which are not mentioned. Optic neuritis often presents with pain and is associated with multiple sclerosis, which is not indicated here. The most likely cause is occlusion of the ophthalmic artery by an embolus, leading to ischemia and the observed fundus findings.",9
1886,"The patient is likely suffering from tinea pedis, a fungal infection commonly known as athlete's foot, due to the wet conditions and maceration between the toes. The symptoms of nausea and vomiting after alcohol consumption suggest a disulfiram-like reaction, which is associated with the antifungal medication griseofulvin. Griseofulvin works by inhibiting fungal mitosis through cell arrest at metaphase, making option A the correct mechanism of action for the drug prescribed in this case.",9
1921,"The patient is receiving cisplatin as part of his chemoradiation therapy. Cisplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug that works by forming covalent bonds with DNA. Specifically, it forms interstrand and intrastrand DNA cross-links, which interfere with DNA replication and transcription, ultimately leading to cell death. This mechanism is distinct from other chemotherapy drugs that may inhibit tubulin polymerization, topoisomerase, or cause free radical damage. Therefore, the best explanation for the mechanism of action of cisplatin is the formation of interstrand DNA cross-links.",9
1922,"The patient's symptoms and findings suggest pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), particularly given the loud P2, right ventricular hypertrophy, and elevated pulmonary artery pressures. A known genetic cause of PAH is a mutation in the BMPR2 gene, which normally functions to inhibit smooth muscle proliferation. Mutations in BMPR2 lead to unchecked proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the pulmonary vasculature, contributing to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and PAH.",9
1930,"The patient presents with acute scrotal pain, tenderness, and swelling, along with signs of a possible urinary tract infection (positive leukocyte esterase and WBCs in urine). These symptoms are suggestive of epididymitis, which is common in sexually active men and often caused by sexually transmitted infections. However, testicular torsion must be ruled out due to its acute presentation and need for urgent intervention. Scrotal ultrasonography with Doppler is the most appropriate next step to differentiate between epididymitis and testicular torsion by assessing blood flow to the testicle.",9
1923,"The mechanism of injury described involves the foot being planted and the knee rotating outward with a buckling inward, which is a classic description for an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. The patient also reports hearing a 'pop' and experiencing immediate pain, which are common symptoms associated with ACL tears. The absence of locking, clicking, or giving way suggests that meniscal injury is less likely. The diffuse swelling and tenderness along the joint line can occur with ACL injuries due to hemarthrosis. Therefore, the most likely structure damaged in this scenario is the anterior cruciate ligament.",9
1925,"The patient is presenting with symptoms and ECG findings consistent with an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), as indicated by the ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. In the setting of a STEMI, the most effective treatment to restore blood flow and minimize myocardial damage is reperfusion therapy. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is preferred over thrombolytics when it can be performed in a timely manner (typically within 90 minutes of first medical contact) because it has been shown to be more effective in reducing mortality and complications associated with STEMI. While thrombolytics can also be used, they are generally considered when PCI is not available within the recommended time frame. Beta blockers and clopidogrel are important in the management of myocardial infarction but do not provide the immediate reperfusion benefit that PCI does. Therefore, PCI will likely have the most benefit in this patient.",10
1926,"The patient's symptoms and findings suggest a possible ectopic pregnancy. She has a history of chlamydia infection, which can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease and increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy. The delayed menstrual period, lower abdominal pain, and the endometrial biopsy showing decidualization without chorionic villi are consistent with an ectopic pregnancy. Decidualization occurs in response to progesterone, but the absence of chorionic villi indicates that the pregnancy is not within the uterine cavity. Therefore, further evaluation is most likely to show a fertilized ovum outside the uterus, which is characteristic of an ectopic pregnancy.",9
1935,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), which includes gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and cognitive impairment. The MRI findings of dilated ventricles with a callosal angle of 60 degrees support this diagnosis. A large-volume lumbar tap is a diagnostic and potentially therapeutic procedure for NPH, as it can help determine if the patient will respond to shunting by temporarily relieving symptoms. The other options do not address the underlying issue of NPH: Acetazolamide is used for idiopathic intracranial hypertension, Donepezil is for Alzheimer's disease, and Levodopa is for Parkinson's disease.",9
1936,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of acute cholecystitis. She has right upper quadrant pain radiating to the shoulder, fever, and a positive Murphy's sign (pauses during inspiration upon deep palpation of the right upper quadrant). Her laboratory findings show mild leukocytosis and elevated bilirubin, which can be associated with gallbladder inflammation or obstruction. The risk factors for gallstones, which can lead to cholecystitis, include obesity (BMI of 35.2 kg/m2), female gender, and a history of multiple pregnancies. These factors are part of the '4 F's' (female, fat, fertile, and forty) that are commonly associated with gallstone disease. Therefore, a history of multiple past pregnancies is a likely finding in this patient.",9
1946,"The clinical presentation suggests the patient is experiencing absence seizures, characterized by brief periods of ""day-dreaming"" or inattentiveness, and myoclonic jerks upon awakening, which are indicative of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Ethosuximide is typically used for absence seizures, but given the presence of myoclonic jerks, valproic acid is the best choice as it is effective for both absence seizures and myoclonic jerks. Carbamazepine is not appropriate for absence seizures and can worsen them. Cognitive behavioral therapy is not a treatment for seizures.",9
1952,"The patient presents with symptoms of urinary retention and constipation, along with a history of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia. The key symptoms to focus on are the urinary retention and constipation, which are likely due to anticholinergic side effects. Desipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, is often used for neuropathic pain and can cause significant anticholinergic side effects, including urinary retention and constipation. The other medications listed do not typically cause these side effects. Simvastatin is a statin used for cholesterol management, amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker used for hypertension, and valproate is an anticonvulsant that can be used for mood stabilization and pain but does not have significant anticholinergic effects. Therefore, desipramine is the most likely drug causing the patient's symptoms.",9
1955,"The patient presents with signs and symptoms consistent with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), including irregular menses, elevated testosterone, and an elevated LH:FSH ratio. The primary treatment for infertility in PCOS is often clomiphene citrate, which works by inhibiting hypothalamic estrogen receptors. This inhibition leads to an increase in the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which subsequently increases the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland, stimulating ovulation. Therefore, the primary mechanism of action of clomiphene citrate is the inhibition of hypothalamic estrogen receptors.",9
1959,"The clinical presentation and findings are consistent with a complete hydatidiform mole. The key features include intractable vomiting, high β-hCG levels, and ultrasound showing a ""snowstorm"" pattern with no fetal parts. The dilation and curettage findings of hydropic villi with diffuse trophoblastic proliferation further support this diagnosis. Complete moles are characterized by the absence of maternal genetic material and duplication of paternal genetic material, resulting in a 46,XX karyotype of paternal origin only. This occurs when an empty ovum is fertilized by a single sperm that duplicates its chromosomes or by two sperm.",9
1956,"The clinical presentation of this patient is suggestive of Prader-Willi syndrome. Key features include hyperphagia leading to obesity, developmental delays, hypotonia, and characteristic facial features such as almond-shaped eyes. The history of delayed motor milestones and the specific body proportions (high weight percentile and low height percentile) further support this diagnosis. Prader-Willi syndrome is also associated with hypogonadism, which is a common finding due to hypothalamic dysfunction. The other options do not align with the typical findings in Prader-Willi syndrome: ataxia is more associated with cerebellar disorders, hemihyperplasia is seen in conditions like Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, and a webbed neck is characteristic of Turner syndrome.",9
1957,"The patient has been diagnosed with non-small cell carcinoma of the lung, and the presence of numerous nodules in the lungs bilaterally suggests metastatic disease. The history of seeing another doctor ""to monitor his prostate"" raises suspicion of a primary prostate cancer that has metastasized to the lungs. Prostate cancer commonly metastasizes to the bones, but it can also spread to the lungs. Metastatic spread to the lungs typically occurs via hematogenous routes, specifically through the pulmonary arteries. This is consistent with the description of numerous nodules in the lungs, which are characteristic of hematogenous spread of cancer.",9
1913,,0
1961,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of Friedreich's ataxia, a hereditary degenerative disease affecting the nervous system and heart. Key features include progressive ataxia, dysarthria, loss of proprioception and vibration sense, kyphoscoliosis, and foot deformities like hammer toes. The family history of vestibular schwannoma is likely unrelated, as it suggests neurofibromatosis type 2, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. Friedreich's ataxia is associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which can lead to heart failure, the most common cause of death in these patients. The neurological symptoms and scoliosis can contribute to respiratory issues, but heart failure is the primary concern.",9
1966,"The vaccine described contains polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP) conjugated to a toxoid carrier. This is characteristic of the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine. The PRP is a component of the Hib capsule, and conjugating it to a protein carrier enhances the immune response, especially in young children. This vaccine is specifically designed to provide immunity against Haemophilus influenzae type b, which can cause serious infections such as meningitis, epiglottitis, and pneumonia in children.",10
1967,"The study described involves examining data at the city level, specifically looking at the relationship between per capita income and syphilis rates across different cities. This type of study is concerned with population-level data rather than individual-level data. The key characteristic of an ecological study is that it examines the relationships between exposure and outcome at the group or population level, rather than at the individual level. In this case, the study is looking at city-wide syphilis rates and income levels, making it an ecological study.",9
1974,"The patient is a 17-year-old boy who has been experiencing bizarre behavior, delusions, and auditory hallucinations for the past three months. He believes the President is spying on him and hears the devil speaking to him. These symptoms indicate a psychotic disorder. 

- Brief psychotic disorder (A) is characterized by symptoms lasting more than one day but less than one month, which does not fit this case as the symptoms have persisted for three months.
- Schizoaffective disorder (B) involves symptoms of schizophrenia along with mood disorder symptoms (depression or mania), which are not described here.
- Schizophreniform disorder (C) is characterized by symptoms of schizophrenia lasting more than one month but less than six months. This fits the duration of the symptoms in this case.
- Schizophrenia (D) requires symptoms to be present for at least six months, which is not the case here.

Given the duration of symptoms (three months) and the absence of mood disorder symptoms, the most appropriate diagnosis is schizophreniform disorder.",9
1975,"The patient is experiencing severe muscle contractions and hyperthermia during anesthesia induction with sevoflurane, which are indicative of malignant hyperthermia. Malignant hyperthermia is a life-threatening condition often triggered by certain anesthetic agents, such as volatile anesthetics and succinylcholine, in susceptible individuals. The pathophysiology involves uncontrolled calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle due to a defect in the ryanodine receptor. The treatment for malignant hyperthermia is dantrolene, which acts as a ryanodine receptor antagonist, reducing calcium release and thereby alleviating the symptoms.",9
1978,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of hemorrhoids, specifically internal hemorrhoids, given the description of engorged vessels and non-painful bloody stools. Internal hemorrhoids are located above the dentate line and are typically painless. The venous drainage of internal hemorrhoids is primarily through the superior rectal vein, which drains into the inferior mesenteric vein and then into the portal venous system. In contrast, external hemorrhoids, which are painful, drain via the inferior rectal vein into the systemic venous system. The middle rectal vein also contributes to the drainage of the rectal area but is less involved in hemorrhoids. The left colic vein is related to the colon, not the rectum. Therefore, the vessel most likely draining blood from the affected region in this case is the superior rectal vein.",9
1986,"The patient is a 67-year-old man with symptoms of fatigue, light-headedness, and a history of fainting. He has a systolic murmur best heard along the right upper sternal border, which is characteristic of aortic stenosis. The patient's age and the presence of a systolic murmur suggest aortic stenosis due to calcification of the valve leaflets, which is common in older adults. The absence of ST elevation and negative cardiac troponins rule out acute coronary syndrome. The symptoms and murmur location are not consistent with autoimmune valve destruction or an incompetent valve. Outflow tract obstruction could be considered, but the classic presentation and murmur location point more towards calcification of the valve leaflets as the cause of aortic stenosis.",9
1984,"To calculate the cardiac stroke volume, we can use the Fick principle, which relates oxygen consumption to cardiac output and the difference in oxygen content between arterial and venous blood. The formula is:

Cardiac Output (CO) = Oxygen Consumption / (Arterial O2 Content - Venous O2 Content)

Given:
- Oxygen consumption = 400 mL O2/min
- Arterial O2 content = 0.2 mL O2/mL
- Venous O2 content = 0.1 mL O2/mL

First, calculate the cardiac output:

CO = 400 mL O2/min / (0.2 mL O2/mL - 0.1 mL O2/mL)
   = 400 mL O2/min / 0.1 mL O2/mL
   = 4000 mL/min

Next, use the cardiac output to find the stroke volume. Stroke volume (SV) is calculated by dividing cardiac output by heart rate:

SV = CO / Heart Rate
   = 4000 mL/min / 100 beats/min
   = 40 mL/beat

Therefore, the stroke volume is 40 mL/beat.",10
1980,"The patient is experiencing episodes of confusion and agitation, likely due to delirium, which is common in elderly hospitalized patients, especially those with dementia. Delirium can be triggered by infections, medications, or environmental changes. In this case, the patient's pneumonia and hospitalization are likely contributing factors. The management of delirium involves addressing the underlying cause and using non-pharmacological interventions like reorientation. However, when a patient is severely agitated and poses a risk to themselves or others, pharmacological intervention may be necessary. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic commonly used to manage acute agitation in delirium. Lorazepam, a benzodiazepine, is generally avoided in elderly patients with delirium as it can worsen confusion. Physical restraints are a last resort due to the risk of injury and worsening agitation. Rivastigmine is used for dementia management, not acute delirium. Therefore, the next best step in managing this patient's acute agitation is to administer Haloperidol.",9
1987,"The patient presents with leg ulcers, splenomegaly, and neutropenia (low white blood cell count with low neutrophils), along with a history of rheumatoid arthritis. These findings are characteristic of Felty syndrome, which is a complication of long-standing rheumatoid arthritis. Felty syndrome is defined by the triad of rheumatoid arthritis, splenomegaly, and neutropenia. The presence of leg ulcers can be associated with the neutropenia and immune dysfunction seen in Felty syndrome. The other options do not fit the clinical picture as well: Venous stasis and valve insufficiency would typically present with varicose veins and is not associated with neutropenia; Vitamin deficiency would not explain the combination of symptoms; Caplan syndrome involves rheumatoid arthritis and pneumoconiosis, not neutropenia or splenomegaly.",9
1995,"The study described is a cohort study where participants are followed over time to observe the incidence of cardiovascular events based on their initial levels of type B LDL cholesterol. In cohort studies, the relative risk (RR) is the most appropriate measure to determine the association between an exposure (elevated type B LDL) and an outcome (cardiovascular events). Relative risk compares the probability of the outcome occurring in the exposed group to the probability in the unexposed group. Odds ratio is more commonly used in case-control studies, while Fisher’s exact test is used for small sample sizes, and likelihood ratios are used in diagnostic testing.",9

2001,"The patient is a 41-year-old African American man with hypertension that has not responded to lifestyle modifications. In African American patients, thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers are often preferred as initial monotherapy for hypertension. Thiazide diuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide, are commonly used and can lead to certain laboratory abnormalities. One of the known side effects of thiazide diuretics is hypercalcemia due to increased renal calcium reabsorption. Therefore, if the patient is started on a thiazide diuretic, hypercalcemia may be observed on follow-up testing.",9
2007,"The patient has a history of HIV with a very low CD4 count of 75 cells/µL, indicating severe immunosuppression. The symptoms of disorientation, confusion, motor weakness, and gait uncoordination, along with the MRI findings of numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions without mass effect, are suggestive of a demyelinating process. The brain biopsy showing demyelination and atypical astrocytes is characteristic of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is caused by reactivation of the John Cunningham virus (JC virus) in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with advanced HIV/AIDS. Autoimmune demyelination would typically present differently and is not associated with HIV. HAND would not show these MRI findings. PCNSL would typically show enhancing lesions with mass effect on MRI.",9
1997,"The key details in this case are the elevated serum α-fetoprotein and the ultrasound finding of fetal viscera freely suspended into the amniotic cavity. Elevated α-fetoprotein is associated with abdominal wall defects. Gastroschisis is characterized by the extrusion of abdominal contents through a defect in the abdominal wall, typically to the right of the umbilical cord, without a covering sac, leading to the appearance of freely floating viscera in the amniotic cavity. Omphalocele, on the other hand, involves herniation of abdominal contents into the base of the umbilical cord, covered by a membrane. The description of freely suspended viscera without mention of a covering membrane is consistent with gastroschisis.",9
2018,"The patient presents with dizziness, fatigue, and bradycardia (heart rate of 50/min) in the context of a history of hypertension and congestive heart failure. These symptoms, along with the low heart rate, suggest a possible bradyarrhythmia. The ECG, although not visible here, likely shows a conduction abnormality such as a high-degree AV block or sinus node dysfunction, given the clinical presentation. 

In such cases, it is crucial to first assess whether the bradycardia could be medication-induced, especially since the patient is on multiple medications for hypertension and heart failure. Common medications that can cause bradycardia include beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin. Therefore, reviewing the patient's medication profile is essential to identify and potentially withhold any offending agents.

While temporary cardiac pacing (option B) might be necessary if the patient is hemodynamically unstable, the patient's blood pressure, although low, is not critically low, and he is not in immediate distress. Thus, the best initial step is to check the medication profile to identify any reversible causes of the bradycardia.",9
2008,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a viral hemorrhagic fever. She has a history of travel to western Africa, where she had contact with animals, including apes. Her symptoms include fever, rash, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, hematemesis, and bleeding from IV sites, which are consistent with a viral hemorrhagic fever. The laboratory findings show thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), as indicated by prolonged PT and PTT and positive fibrin split products. These findings are characteristic of Ebola virus infection. Plasmodium falciparum typically causes malaria, which presents with fever and anemia but not with hemorrhagic symptoms or DIC. Yersinia pestis causes plague, which does not fit the clinical picture. Zika virus is associated with mild symptoms and does not cause hemorrhagic fever. Therefore, the most likely causal pathogen is the Ebola virus.",9
2019,"The clinical presentation and MRI findings are suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS). The patient's symptoms of double vision, imbalance, and decreased sensation, along with the MRI showing hyperintense plaques, are characteristic of MS. The impaired adduction of the right eye with left lateral gaze and normal convergence indicates internuclear ophthalmoplegia, which is common in MS due to demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus. The deep tendon reflexes being 4+ and a positive Romberg test further support a neurological disorder. In MS, the pathological hallmark is demyelination with relative preservation of axons, which is consistent with option D.",9
2020,"The patient is experiencing symptoms consistent with lithium toxicity, which include nausea, vomiting, increased urinary frequency, coarse tremor, and hyperreflexia. Lithium toxicity can be precipitated by medications that affect renal clearance. Indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), can decrease renal clearance of lithium, leading to increased lithium levels and toxicity. Acetazolamide, atorvastatin, and metoprolol are less likely to affect lithium levels in this way. Therefore, indomethacin is the most likely medication responsible for the patient's current presentation.",9
2023,"The patient presents with new onset hypertension and proteinuria at 35 weeks gestation, which is suggestive of preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is more common in primigravidas (first-time pregnancies). The patient's smoking history, low BMI, and family history of hypertension are not directly associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia. However, being a primigravida is a well-known risk factor for developing preeclampsia.",9
2026,"To support a causal relationship, one important aspect is the presence of a dose-response relationship. This means that as the exposure increases, the risk of the outcome also increases. In this study, the relative risk (RR) increases with the number of DKA episodes in the past 3 years: 1.23 for 1-2 episodes, 1.48 for 3-4 episodes, and 2.20 for 5+ episodes. This pattern suggests that the more episodes of DKA a patient has had, the higher their risk of readmission, supporting a causal relationship. While confidence intervals that do not cross 1.0 indicate statistical significance, they do not directly support causality. A case-control study design is not relevant here as this is a cohort study. A high odds ratio is not applicable since relative risks are being used.",9
2029,"The patient is presenting with signs of sepsis, likely due to an infection given his fever, cough, and flu-like symptoms. His low blood pressure, altered mental status, and hypoxia indicate he is in septic shock. The advanced directive allows for interventions except for CPR, so aggressive management is appropriate. Immediate priorities in septic shock include stabilizing the airway, breathing, and circulation. Intubation is necessary due to his respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation. Intravenous antibiotics should be administered promptly to address the underlying infection. While intravenous fluids are also critical in managing septic shock, the immediate need to secure the airway and address the infection takes precedence. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to intubate and administer intravenous antibiotics.",9
2022,"The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), characterized by a sudden 'thunderclap' headache, neck stiffness, and papilledema. The CT scan is typically the first step to confirm the diagnosis of SAH. If the CT scan is negative but suspicion remains high, a lumbar puncture is performed to look for xanthochromia or red blood cells in the cerebrospinal fluid, which would confirm SAH. However, if the CT scan shows evidence of SAH, the next step is to manage the patient's blood pressure to prevent rebleeding. Labetalol is commonly used to control blood pressure in this setting. Mannitol is used for reducing intracranial pressure, dexamethasone is used for reducing cerebral edema in cases like brain tumors, and lumbar puncture is not indicated if the CT scan confirms SAH.",9
2031,"The patient presents with microcytic anemia (low MCV) and an abnormal hemoglobin electrophoresis showing increased Hemoglobin A2. This is suggestive of beta-thalassemia trait, which is characterized by microcytic anemia and an increased percentage of Hemoglobin A2. In beta-thalassemia trait, the blood smear typically shows target cells, also known as codocytes, due to the imbalance in globin chain production. The other options are not consistent with the findings: megaloblasts are seen in macrocytic anemias, sideroblasts are seen in sideroblastic anemia, and schistocytes are seen in microangiopathic hemolytic anemias.",9
2034,"The patient has a history of cirrhosis and recurrent esophageal variceal bleeding, which has been managed with endoscopic banding. His hemoglobin levels are stable post-procedure, indicating he is not actively bleeding. The best next step is to address the underlying portal hypertension to prevent future episodes. TIPS is a procedure that can reduce portal pressure and prevent recurrent variceal bleeding. Given his history of recurrent bleeding despite endoscopic management, discussing TIPS is appropriate. Monitoring and discharge without addressing the underlying issue may lead to further episodes. Long-term octreotide is not typically used, and his hemoglobin levels do not indicate the need for transfusion.",9
1988,"The infant is presenting with weakness, spasms, difficulty feeding, and a weak suck, along with generalized muscle stiffness and twitches. These symptoms are suggestive of a neuromuscular condition. The context of the mother refusing antenatal vaccines, combined with the home delivery, raises concerns about neonatal tetanus, especially considering the spasms and muscle stiffness. Neonatal tetanus can occur if the mother is not vaccinated and the umbilical stump becomes contaminated, often presenting with muscle spasms, stiffness, and difficulty feeding. The ingestion of honey is a distractor, as it is associated with infant botulism, which presents with hypotonia (floppy baby syndrome) rather than stiffness and spasms. The correct organism causing neonatal tetanus is Clostridium tetani.",9
2036,"The patient is in shock with elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and increased systemic vascular resistance, which are indicative of cardiogenic shock. In cardiogenic shock, the heart fails to pump effectively, leading to decreased cardiac output and poor perfusion of tissues. This results in cold, clammy skin due to peripheral vasoconstriction as the body attempts to maintain blood pressure. The elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure suggests left-sided heart failure, contributing to pulmonary congestion. The increased systemic vascular resistance is a compensatory mechanism to maintain perfusion pressure. Confusion can occur due to decreased cerebral perfusion as a result of reduced stroke volume and cardiac output.",9
2052,"The key points in this case are the delayed bone age and the normal physical examination, including Tanner stage 2 sexual development. The boy's growth pattern shows normal birth height and weight, but a drift to the 5th percentile after six months. His bone age is delayed, which is consistent with constitutional growth delay. This condition is characterized by a temporary delay in skeletal growth and puberty, resulting in short stature during childhood but normal adult height. Familial short stature would typically show normal bone age and a consistent growth pattern along a lower percentile. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia would likely present with other symptoms such as virilization or electrolyte imbalances. Growth hormone deficiency could also cause delayed bone age, but the normal development and lack of other symptoms make constitutional growth delay more likely.",9
2054,"To determine the initial dose required to reach the desired target plasma concentration, we use the formula: \( \text{Dose} = \text{Target Concentration} \times \text{Volume of Distribution} \). The target concentration is 4.5 mg/L and the volume of distribution is 30 L. Therefore, the dose is calculated as follows: \( \text{Dose} = 4.5 \text{ mg/L} \times 30 \text{ L} = 135 \text{ mg} \).",10
2060,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of Cushing's syndrome, such as weight gain, abdominal striae, and hypertension. The MRI findings of a pituitary adenoma indicate Cushing's disease, where the pituitary adenoma secretes excess ACTH, leading to increased cortisol production by the adrenal glands. Surgical resection of the pituitary adenoma is the treatment of choice. However, after the removal of the adenoma, the patient may experience adrenal insufficiency due to the sudden drop in ACTH stimulation, as the adrenal glands may have atrophied from prolonged suppression. To prevent adrenal crisis and ensure normal functioning of the HPA axis post-surgery, glucocorticoid replacement therapy is necessary. Hydrocortisone is a glucocorticoid used to replace cortisol in such cases.",9
2055,"The patient is likely infected with Klebsiella pneumoniae, a gram-negative, encapsulated bacillus commonly associated with pneumonia in individuals with alcohol use disorder. The organism is resistant to several antibiotics, indicating a multidrug-resistant strain. Klebsiella pneumoniae is primarily transmitted via contact, not through droplets or airborne routes. Therefore, the most appropriate infection control measure is to prevent contact transmission. This is typically achieved by isolating the patient in a single-occupancy room to minimize the risk of spreading the organism to other patients and healthcare workers.",9
2064,"The patient's symptoms and the results of the tuning fork tests suggest a specific type of hearing loss. The Rinne test (placing the tuning fork on the mastoid process and then near the ear) shows that air conduction is better than bone conduction in both ears, which is normal or indicative of sensorineural hearing loss. The Weber test (placing the tuning fork on the forehead) shows lateralization to the right ear, indicating that the left ear has sensorineural hearing loss since sound lateralizes to the better-hearing ear in sensorineural loss.

Given the patient's age and the unilateral nature of the symptoms, an acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma) is a likely cause of the sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear. Presbycusis typically causes bilateral hearing loss, cerumen impaction would cause conductive hearing loss, and Ménière disease would present with episodic vertigo, which is not mentioned here.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is an acoustic neuroma.",9
2072,"The patient has a chemoport, which is a central venous catheter, and presents with symptoms suggestive of infective endocarditis, including fever, chills, dyspnea, and a new heart murmur. The echocardiography shows a vegetation on the tricuspid valve, which is commonly associated with right-sided endocarditis, often seen in intravenous drug users or patients with central venous catheters. The most common organism causing catheter-related bloodstream infections and subsequent endocarditis is Staphylococcus aureus, which is a gram-positive, catalase-positive, coagulase-positive cocci in clusters. This organism is known for its ability to form biofilms on indwelling devices like chemoports.",9
2074,"The patient presents with symptoms and lab findings suggestive of premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), also known as premature ovarian failure. She has irregular menstruation, hot flashes, and elevated FSH levels with low estradiol, indicating decreased ovarian function. Her TSH is within the normal range for someone on levothyroxine, so increasing the dose is not necessary. The best management for POI is hormone replacement therapy to alleviate symptoms and prevent long-term complications such as osteoporosis. An estradiol patch with oral medroxyprogesterone is appropriate for hormone replacement therapy in this case.",9
2075,"The patient presents with jaundice, icteric sclera, and a history of alcohol use, suggesting alcoholic liver disease. The laboratory findings show macrocytic anemia (MCV 105 µm3), leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia, which are consistent with liver disease. In alcoholic liver disease, the AST is typically elevated more than ALT, often with an AST/ALT ratio greater than 2. This is due to the fact that alcohol induces mitochondrial damage, and AST is more present in mitochondria than ALT. Therefore, the expected liver function test pattern in this patient would be an elevated AST with a higher AST/ALT ratio, consistent with option B.",9
2037,,0
2076,"The patient presents with rectal bleeding, a family history of colon cancer, and multiple polyps found on proctosigmoidoscopy. Additionally, there are extra-colonic manifestations such as a hard mass over the mandible and a mass over the rectus abdominis muscle. These findings are characteristic of Gardner's syndrome, which is a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Gardner's syndrome is associated with multiple colorectal polyps and extracolonic manifestations such as osteomas (often found in the mandible) and soft tissue tumors (such as desmoid tumors). The family history of early-onset colon cancer further supports this diagnosis. Lynch syndrome (B) is characterized by hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer without the presence of numerous polyps or extracolonic manifestations like osteomas. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (C) involves hamartomatous polyps and mucocutaneous pigmentation, which are not present here. Turcot's syndrome (D) involves polyps and brain tumors, which are not indicated in this case. Therefore, the best explanation for these findings is Gardner's syndrome.",9
2079,"The patient has Alzheimer dementia and is currently on donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor. His symptoms have progressed, indicating a need for additional treatment. Memantine is an NMDA receptor antagonist used in moderate to severe Alzheimer dementia to help with cognitive symptoms. Risperidone is an antipsychotic used for behavioral symptoms, not cognitive decline. Ginkgo biloba is not a standard treatment for Alzheimer dementia. Citalopram is an antidepressant and not indicated for cognitive symptoms of dementia. Therefore, memantine is the most appropriate choice to address the progression of cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer dementia.",9
2011,"The patient is presenting with a history and laboratory findings suggestive of a bleeding disorder. Key points include the prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and normal platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), and bleeding time. This profile is typical of Hemophilia A or B, where there is a deficiency in intrinsic pathway coagulation factors (Factor VIII in Hemophilia A or Factor IX in Hemophilia B). The prolonged PTT indicates a defect in the intrinsic pathway, which includes Factors VIII, IX, XI, and XII. Normal PT and bleeding time rule out deficiencies in extrinsic pathway factors (such as Factor VII) and platelet function disorders, respectively. Given the history of prolonged bleeding and normal PT, Hemophilia A (Factor VIII deficiency) or B (Factor IX deficiency) is more likely than disorders involving Protein C, plasmin, or thrombin. Since Factor VII deficiency would lead to prolonged PT, Factor VII is unlikely to be the issue here. The most common of these conditions is Hemophilia A, a Factor VIII deficiency.",9
2082,"The patient has psoriasis and is being treated with a high-potency topical medication that inhibits NF-κB and phospholipase A2, which is characteristic of topical corticosteroids. Long-term use of topical corticosteroids can lead to skin atrophy due to dermal collagen loss. This is because corticosteroids inhibit fibroblast function and collagen synthesis, leading to thinning of the skin.",9
2085,"The patient presents with symptoms that include visual hallucinations, fluctuating cognition, and Parkinsonism, which are characteristic of Lewy body dementia. The presence of Parkinsonian symptoms, such as resting tremor and muscle rigidity, along with cognitive decline and hallucinations, suggests Lewy body deposition as the underlying cause. Vascular infarcts would typically present with a stepwise decline and focal neurological deficits. Frontotemporal lobe atrophy is associated with personality changes and language difficulties, not hallucinations. Thiamine deficiency, associated with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, would present with confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia, which are not seen here. Therefore, the most likely cause is Lewy body deposition.",9
2086,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a recurrence of malaria. She was previously treated with chloroquine, which is effective against the blood stages of Plasmodium species but does not eliminate the liver stages of Plasmodium vivax or Plasmodium ovale. These species can form hypnozoites, which are dormant liver stages that can reactivate and cause relapses. The recurrence of symptoms after several months is characteristic of reactivation of these dormant liver stages. Reinfection by an Anopheles mosquito (option B) is less likely given the time frame and the fact that she has not been in an endemic area recently. Decline in circulating antibodies (option A) and dissemination within macrophages (option D) are not relevant to the pathophysiology of malaria relapses.",9
2087,"The clinical presentation of the child includes difficulty feeding, poor motor function, diminished muscle tone, areflexia, hepatosplenomegaly, and macular cherry red spots. These symptoms are indicative of a lysosomal storage disorder. The presence of hepatosplenomegaly and cherry red spots narrows down the possibilities.

Tay-Sachs disease, caused by a deficiency of Hexosaminidase A, presents with cherry red spots but does not typically include hepatosplenomegaly.

Niemann-Pick disease, caused by a deficiency of Sphingomyelinase, presents with cherry red spots and hepatosplenomegaly, along with neurological symptoms such as hypotonia and developmental regression.

Given the combination of symptoms, particularly the presence of both hepatosplenomegaly and cherry red spots, the most likely deficiency in this child is Sphingomyelinase, which is consistent with Niemann-Pick disease.",9
2083,"The patient has been experiencing symptoms for 9 months, which rules out Brief Psychotic Disorder (B) as it requires symptoms for less than a month. The presence of hallucinations (hearing ghosts) and delusions (being asked to kill) suggests a psychotic disorder. Schizophrenia (C) requires at least 6 months of symptoms, which fits the duration here. However, the patient also experienced a 4-week period of depressive symptoms (insomnia, weight loss, feeling worthless), which suggests a mood component. Schizoaffective disorder (A) involves symptoms of schizophrenia along with mood disorder symptoms, and the mood symptoms must be present for a substantial portion of the illness. Delusional disorder (D) is characterized by non-bizarre delusions without the prominent hallucinations or mood symptoms seen here. Given the combination of psychotic and mood symptoms, Schizoaffective disorder is the most fitting diagnosis.",9
2096,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), including chronic worry, sleep disturbances, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, and physical symptoms like difficulty with erections. The symptoms have persisted for 9 months, which aligns with the diagnostic criteria for GAD. In treating GAD, first-line pharmacological treatments typically include SSRIs or SNRIs, but these are not options here. Among the options provided, buspirone is an anxiolytic that is specifically used for GAD and is non-sedating, making it a suitable choice for long-term management. Propranolol is more appropriate for performance anxiety or physical symptoms of anxiety, lorazepam is a benzodiazepine suitable for short-term use due to risk of dependence, and valerian is an herbal supplement with limited evidence for efficacy. Therefore, buspirone is the most appropriate choice for this patient's generalized anxiety disorder.",9
2099,"The patient's symptoms and history are suggestive of a severe drug reaction. She was recently started on a medication for trigeminal neuralgia, which is often treated with carbamazepine, a drug known to cause Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). The key features of SJS include a painful, itchy rash that involves the mucous membranes (such as the conjunctiva and oral mucosa), systemic symptoms like fever and malaise, and skin findings such as bullae and desquamation. The positive Nikolsky sign (epidermis separates with light stroking) is also characteristic of SJS. The involvement of palms and soles, along with the systemic symptoms and mucosal involvement, aligns with SJS rather than the other options.",9
2097,"The patient is 20 weeks pregnant and has a history of seizures. She discontinued valproic acid due to pregnancy, likely due to concerns about teratogenicity. She is now starting carbamazepine, which is also associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects, although less so than valproic acid. During pregnancy, folate supplementation is crucial, especially in women taking antiepileptic drugs, to reduce the risk of neural tube defects. Therefore, folate is the most appropriate treatment to support fetal development and mitigate the risks associated with carbamazepine use during pregnancy.",9
2101,"The patient presents with signs and symptoms suggestive of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), given the acute abdominal pain, hypotension, tachycardia, and ultrasound findings of focal dilation of the aorta with peri-aortic fluid, which likely indicates hemorrhage. In the context of a suspected ruptured AAA, the priority is to stabilize the patient and proceed with emergent surgical intervention to repair the aneurysm and control the bleeding. Administering labetalol or counseling on smoking cessation are not immediate life-saving measures in this acute scenario. Serial annual ultrasounds are for monitoring stable aneurysms, not for acute management. Therefore, the best next step is emergent surgical intervention.",9
2111,"The clinical presentation of the patient suggests a diagnosis of Fragile X syndrome. Key features include intellectual disability, behavioral disorders with autistic features, elongated face, prominent chin, macroglossia, and enlarged testicles (macroorchidism). The presence of extra teeth and dental crowding can also be associated with this condition. Fragile X syndrome is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion of CGG in the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome.",9
2104,"The newborn presents with features suggestive of Potter sequence, which is associated with oligohydramnios. The physical findings include facial anomalies (flat nose, low-set ears), limb deformities, and pulmonary hypoplasia, all of which are consistent with this condition. The renal ultrasound shows bilateral dilatation of the renal pelvis and ureters, suggesting a possible urinary tract obstruction, such as posterior urethral valves, which is a common cause of oligohydramnios in males. To confirm the underlying cause of the oligohydramnios and associated findings, a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) would be appropriate as it can identify urinary tract obstructions like posterior urethral valves.",9
2115,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of Horner's syndrome: ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis (though anhidrosis is not mentioned, it is part of the classic triad). The anisocoria is more pronounced in dim light, indicating a sympathetic pathway lesion. The application of apraclonidine, which reverses the anisocoria by dilating the affected pupil, confirms Horner's syndrome. Given the patient's history of smoking and shoulder pain, there is a suspicion of a Pancoast tumor (superior sulcus tumor) causing the Horner's syndrome by compressing the sympathetic chain. A CT scan of the chest is the most appropriate next step to evaluate for a possible Pancoast tumor.",9
2109,"The patient presents with spontaneous gum bleeding, purpuric skin lesions, and a very low platelet count (18,000/mm3), which suggests a platelet disorder. The normal prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) indicate that the coagulation cascade is intact, ruling out consumptive coagulopathy (DIC) as a cause. The normal bleeding time suggests that platelet function is not impaired, which would be expected in Von Willebrand disease, ruling out option A. The presence of petechiae and purpura with a low platelet count is characteristic of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), where IgG antibodies target platelets, leading to their destruction. Shiga-like toxin (option B) is associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome, which typically presents with hemolytic anemia, renal failure, and thrombocytopenia, but this patient does not have anemia or renal failure. Therefore, the most likely mechanism is IgG antibodies against platelets, consistent with ITP.",9
2114,"The patient has rheumatoid arthritis and started a new medication, after which she developed oral ulcers, elevated liver enzymes, and renal impairment. These side effects are consistent with methotrexate, a common drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Methotrexate can cause mucositis (oral ulcers), hepatotoxicity (elevated liver enzymes), and renal toxicity. Methotrexate works by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase, which is crucial for DNA synthesis and cell replication. This mechanism leads to reduced proliferation of rapidly dividing cells, such as those in the immune system, which helps control rheumatoid arthritis.",9
2116,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with organophosphate poisoning, which is common in agricultural settings. These symptoms include pinpoint pupils, muscle fasciculations, diaphoresis, bradycardia, hypotension, and respiratory depression. Organophosphates inhibit acetylcholinesterase, leading to an accumulation of acetylcholine and overstimulation of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. The treatment involves administering atropine to counteract muscarinic effects and pralidoxime to regenerate acetylcholinesterase and address nicotinic effects. Therefore, the best next step is to administer both atropine and pralidoxime.",9
2117,"The patient is a 73-year-old female with symptoms suggestive of Alzheimer's disease, including getting lost in familiar places and difficulty with memory tasks like paying bills. Her mini-mental status exam score of 19/30 indicates moderate cognitive impairment. Secondary causes of cognitive decline have been ruled out. In Alzheimer's disease, medications that can be used to slow the progression include cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists. Memantine is an NMDA receptor antagonist used in moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease to help slow progression. The other options, ropinirole, pramipexole, and pergolide, are dopamine agonists used in Parkinson's disease, not Alzheimer's disease.",9
2124,"The patient is exhibiting symptoms consistent with a manic episode, including decreased need for sleep, increased energy, grandiosity, and impulsive behavior (excessive online shopping). She also has a history suggestive of a depressive episode, indicating a possible diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The best initial treatment for acute mania in bipolar disorder typically involves mood stabilizers or antipsychotics. Valproate is a mood stabilizer, and olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic, both of which are effective in managing acute mania. Combining these two can help stabilize mood and control manic symptoms. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic but is not typically the first choice due to side effect profiles. Electroconvulsive therapy is generally reserved for severe cases or treatment-resistant mania. Venlafaxine is an antidepressant and is not indicated for acute mania as it can potentially worsen manic symptoms.",9
2122,"The clinical presentation of the 7-month-old boy suggests a neurodegenerative disorder with specific symptoms: progressive weakness, exaggerated startle response, diminishing visual response, and hyperreflexia. The key finding on fundoscopy is likely a cherry-red spot, which is characteristic of certain lysosomal storage diseases. Given the boy's eastern European ancestry, Tay-Sachs disease is a strong consideration. Tay-Sachs disease is caused by a deficiency of Hexosaminidase A, leading to the accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in neurons. This accumulation results in the neurological symptoms observed. The absence of hepatosplenomegaly helps differentiate Tay-Sachs from similar conditions like Niemann-Pick disease.",9
2118,"The patient's symptoms and pulmonary function test results are indicative of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The FEV1:FVC ratio of 62% confirms the presence of obstructive lung disease. The most common cause of COPD is smoking, and smoking cessation is the only intervention proven to slow the decline in lung function (FEV1) in patients with COPD. While bronchodilators like salmeterol and inhaled corticosteroids like fluticasone can help manage symptoms and reduce exacerbations, they do not significantly alter the long-term decline in lung function. Alpha-1 antitrypsin therapy is specific for patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which is not indicated in this case without further information. Therefore, smoking cessation is the most effective intervention to slow the decline in FEV1.",9
2128,"The patient has experienced an acute coronary syndrome, likely a myocardial infarction, given the presentation and the occlusion of the left anterior descending artery. After stent placement, dual antiplatelet therapy is typically prescribed, which includes aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor. The most common P2Y12 inhibitors are clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor. These medications work by irreversibly blocking the ADP receptor on platelets, preventing platelet aggregation. Therefore, the mechanism of action of the most likely prescribed antiplatelet medication is irreversible ADP receptor antagonism.",9
2127,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of acute pancreatitis, likely due to alcohol consumption given the context of the onset after drinking. The elevated lipase and amylase levels support this diagnosis. However, the elevated ALT suggests a possible biliary cause, such as gallstone pancreatitis. In cases of suspected gallstone pancreatitis, a right upper quadrant ultrasound is the most appropriate next step to evaluate for gallstones or biliary obstruction. This is because ultrasound is non-invasive and effective in detecting gallstones, which could guide further management.",9
2129,"The patient presents with painless hematuria and a history of uncontrolled migraines. The renal biopsy shows papillary necrosis and a tubulointerstitial infiltrate. These findings are suggestive of analgesic nephropathy, which is associated with long-term use of analgesics, particularly NSAIDs or combination analgesics, often used for chronic pain conditions like migraines. The elevated serum creatinine indicates renal impairment. Kidney stones typically cause pain, bladder cancer would not cause papillary necrosis, and sickle cell disease is less likely given the patient's ethnicity and lack of other symptoms. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is analgesic nephropathy.",9
2135,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs consistent with infectious mononucleosis, confirmed by a positive heterophile antibody test. This condition is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The key management points for infectious mononucleosis include supportive care and avoiding contact sports due to the risk of splenic rupture, even if splenomegaly is not clinically evident. Although the abdominal examination shows no abnormalities, splenomegaly can still be present and is a concern. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to advise the patient to refrain from participating in contact sports, such as soccer, to prevent potential splenic injury. Writing a medical note to excuse the patient from soccer events is the best course of action.",9
2137,"The patient is a 16-year-old girl who has not yet attained menarche and shows no signs of secondary sexual characteristics (Tanner stage 1 for both breast and pubic hair development). This suggests primary amenorrhea with a lack of pubertal development. In such cases, it is important to assess whether the issue is due to a lack of gonadotropin stimulation from the pituitary or a problem with the ovaries themselves. 

The most appropriate initial test to differentiate between these possibilities is to measure the serum FSH level. A high FSH level would suggest primary ovarian insufficiency, while a low or normal FSH level would suggest a central cause, such as hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. 

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to check the serum FSH level.",9
2136,"The patient presents with watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and hyponatremia. These symptoms are suggestive of a secretory diarrhea, which can be caused by a VIPoma. VIPomas are pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors that secrete vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), leading to watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria (WDHA syndrome). The improvement of symptoms with octreotide, a somatostatin analog, supports the diagnosis of a VIPoma, as octreotide inhibits the release of VIP. Glucagonoma typically presents with necrolytic migratory erythema and hyperglycemia, somatostatinoma with diabetes, gallstones, and steatorrhea, and gastrinoma with peptic ulcer disease due to excess gastric acid production. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is VIPoma.",9
2142,"The patient presents with symptoms and history suggestive of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), specifically chronic bronchitis. The key features include a productive cough for at least 2 years, smoking history, and pulmonary function tests showing an obstructive pattern (FEV1/FVC < 70%) with no significant reversibility after bronchodilator use. The physical exam findings of wheezing and rhonchi that improve after coughing are consistent with mucus production and airway obstruction. In chronic bronchitis, the pathology involves inflammation of the bronchi with hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the mucous glands, leading to increased mucus production and airway obstruction. This matches option D.",9
2141,"The physiologist is studying mediators activated by the clotting cascade, specifically through the activation of factor XII, which leads to the activation of kallikrein. Kallikrein then acts on kininogen to produce kinins, such as bradykinin. These kinins are known to contract visceral smooth muscle, relax vascular smooth muscle, increase capillary permeability, cause pain, and mobilize leukocytes. These effects are characteristic of kinins, which are derived from kininogen. Therefore, the precursor protein for the mediators being studied is kininogen.",9
2144,"The clinical presentation of recurrent bacterial infections, particularly with encapsulated organisms like pneumococcus, and the undetectable levels of all serum immunoglobulins suggest a defect in B-cell development or function. The family history of similar issues in male relatives points towards an X-linked condition. Bruton agammaglobulinemia, also known as X-linked agammaglobulinemia, is characterized by a lack of mature B cells, leading to very low or absent immunoglobulins. This condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern, which fits the family history of affected males. Common variable immunodeficiency typically presents later in life and is not X-linked. Hereditary angioedema and DiGeorge syndrome do not match the immunoglobulin profile or the inheritance pattern described.",9
2140,"The patient presents with signs and symptoms consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), including hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis (low bicarbonate), and positive urine ketones. In DKA, insulin therapy is initiated to reduce blood glucose and correct acidosis. However, insulin also drives potassium into cells, which can lead to hypokalemia. Although the initial serum potassium is normal, it is likely to drop as insulin therapy continues. Therefore, monitoring and replacing potassium is crucial to prevent hypokalemia. The most appropriate next step is to start intravenous potassium chloride to maintain normal potassium levels as insulin therapy progresses.",9
2151,"The patient has expressed a clear wish not to know his diagnosis, which is a valid choice. However, it is important for the physician to understand the patient's reasoning to ensure that he is making an informed decision and that there are no misunderstandings or underlying issues that need to be addressed. Exploring the patient's reasons can help the physician respect the patient's autonomy while ensuring that he is fully informed about the implications of his decision. Therefore, the most appropriate response is to explore the patient's reasoning further.",9
2152,"The patient is experiencing proximal muscle weakness and has an elevated creatine kinase (CK) level, which suggests statin-induced myopathy. The LDL-cholesterol level has improved significantly, indicating that the simvastatin is effective in lowering cholesterol. However, the muscle symptoms and elevated CK suggest that the statin is causing muscle damage. The most appropriate management is to discontinue the current statin to allow muscle symptoms to resolve. Pravastatin is a statin with a lower risk of myopathy, so switching to pravastatin after a washout period is a reasonable approach. Therefore, the best next step is to discontinue simvastatin and start pravastatin in 3 weeks.",9
2148,"The scenario describes a sudden cardiac death in a young athlete, which is often due to an underlying cardiac condition. A defect in the atrial septum (A) typically does not cause sudden death in this manner. Postductal narrowing of the aorta (B), or coarctation, usually presents with hypertension or heart failure symptoms rather than sudden death. Atheromatous plaque rupture (C) is more common in older individuals with coronary artery disease. Interventricular septal hypertrophy (D) is characteristic of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a common cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes due to arrhythmias. Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient is interventricular septal hypertrophy.",9
2155,"The patient's symptoms and MRI findings are suggestive of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), characterized by the triad of gait disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, and urinary incontinence. The MRI shows dilated ventricles with high periventricular FLAIR signal, which is typical for NPH. The improvement in gait after a large-volume lumbar puncture further supports this diagnosis. A known risk factor for NPH is a history of subarachnoid hemorrhage, which can lead to impaired cerebrospinal fluid absorption and subsequent ventricular enlargement. Other options like diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, and hypertension are not directly associated with the development of NPH.",9
2159,"The patient presents with progressive lower extremity weakness, urinary incontinence, and sensory loss in a pattern suggestive of spinal cord compression. The presence of multiple sclerotic lesions in the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae on x-ray suggests metastatic disease. In older men, the most common cause of sclerotic bone metastases is prostate cancer. Prostate cancer often metastasizes to the spine and can cause spinal cord compression, leading to the neurological symptoms observed. Elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a common finding in prostate cancer, especially when it has metastasized. The other options are less likely given the presentation and imaging findings: an irregular mole suggests melanoma, an enlarged thyroid lobe suggests thyroid cancer, and Bence Jones protein is associated with multiple myeloma, which typically causes lytic rather than sclerotic lesions.",9
2157,"The symptoms and clinical findings in this case are suggestive of diphtheria, which is caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The key features include a sore throat, fever, and the presence of a grey-white membrane on the soft palate and tonsils. The regurgitation of water from the nose when drinking suggests possible involvement of the cranial nerves, which can occur in diphtheria due to toxin-mediated neuropathy. The diffuse neck swelling and cervical lymphadenopathy are consistent with the 'bull neck' appearance seen in diphtheria. The patient's immunization status is unknown, and he recently moved from Asia, where vaccination coverage might be lower. Diphtheria can be prevented by the DTaP vaccine, which includes protection against Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Other options like Haemophilus influenzae b, agranulocytosis, and Epstein Barr virus do not fit the clinical picture as closely as diphtheria does.",9
2158,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of Prinzmetal's angina (also known as variant angina), characterized by chest pain at rest with transient ST-segment elevation and negative troponins. This condition is due to coronary artery spasm rather than atherosclerotic plaque rupture. The best long-term treatment for Prinzmetal's angina is a calcium channel blocker, which helps prevent coronary vasospasm. Diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, is effective in managing this condition by relaxing the coronary arteries and preventing spasms.",9
2161,"In the first study, the researchers concluded that there was no effect of the compound on hip fracture incidence, but later studies showed that the compound was indeed effective. This suggests that the first study failed to detect a true effect. This scenario is indicative of a Type II error, which occurs when a study fails to reject a false null hypothesis, meaning it misses a true effect that is present. Type I error would involve incorrectly finding a difference when there is none, and Type III error involves correctly rejecting the null hypothesis for the wrong reason. Selection bias refers to systematic differences in the characteristics of the groups being compared, which is not the issue here.",9
2164,"The patient presents with epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and hypotension. The symptoms suggest a possible metabolic alkalosis due to vomiting, which leads to loss of gastric acid (HCl) and results in increased serum bicarbonate. In metabolic alkalosis, we expect an elevated pH and elevated bicarbonate levels. Additionally, the body may attempt to compensate by hypoventilating, leading to increased PaCO2. 

Let's analyze the options:

- **Option A**: Normal pH, normal PaCO2, normal chloride, slightly elevated bicarbonate. This does not fit the expected pattern of metabolic alkalosis.

- **Option B**: Elevated pH, low PaCO2, normal chloride, low bicarbonate. This suggests respiratory alkalosis, not metabolic alkalosis.

- **Option C**: Elevated pH, elevated PaCO2, low chloride, elevated bicarbonate. This is consistent with metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compensation.

- **Option D**: Low pH, low PaCO2, low chloride, low bicarbonate. This suggests metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation.

Option C is the best fit for metabolic alkalosis due to vomiting, with compensatory respiratory acidosis.",9
2168,"The patient's symptoms of facial flushing, watery diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort, along with the laboratory findings of hypokalemia and hypercalcemia, suggest a neuroendocrine tumor. The continuous, high-volume watery diarrhea that persists even during fasting is characteristic of a secretory diarrhea. The elevated serum glucose and calcium levels further support the presence of a neuroendocrine tumor.

The key symptom here is the profuse watery diarrhea, which is often associated with a VIPoma (vasoactive intestinal peptide-secreting tumor). VIPomas cause watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria (WDHA syndrome). The elevated serum glucose could be due to the stress of the illness or a concurrent condition, but it is not the primary focus here.

Other options:
- Urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid excretion is used to diagnose carcinoid syndrome, which also causes flushing and diarrhea, but the diarrhea in carcinoid syndrome is not typically as voluminous as described here.
- Plasma gastrin level is used to diagnose Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, which causes peptic ulcers and diarrhea due to excess gastric acid, but the diarrhea is not typically as watery and voluminous.
- Plasma glucagon level is used to diagnose glucagonoma, which causes necrolytic migratory erythema, diabetes, and weight loss, but not typically watery diarrhea.

Therefore, the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis of a VIPoma is the measurement of plasma vasoactive intestinal peptide.",9
2171,"The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, blurry vision, and altered color perception are suggestive of digoxin toxicity. Digoxin is commonly used in patients with congestive heart failure and low ejection fraction. One of the key characteristics of digoxin is its narrow therapeutic index, meaning the ratio of the toxic dose to the effective dose is close to 1. This narrow margin makes it easy for patients to develop toxicity, especially if there are changes in renal function, drug interactions, or dosing errors.",9
2169,"The symptoms described in the vignette are suggestive of Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), a small-vessel vasculitis that commonly occurs in children. It often follows an upper respiratory tract infection. The classic tetrad of HSP includes palpable purpura (usually on the buttocks and legs), arthralgias, abdominal pain, and renal involvement. The renal involvement typically manifests as hematuria due to IgA deposition in the kidneys. Genital ulcers are not associated with HSP, and thrombocytopenia is not a feature of this condition as the purpura is due to vasculitis, not platelet abnormalities. A tick bite is unrelated to the symptoms described. Therefore, further evaluation is most likely to show hematuria.",9
2176,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with migraine headaches, characterized by severe, unilateral, throbbing pain, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. The use of estrogen-containing oral contraceptive pills and the patient's gender and age also support this diagnosis. The MRI being normal rules out other structural causes. For migraine prophylaxis, amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, is commonly used and effective. Sumatriptan is used for acute treatment, not prophylaxis. Methysergide is not commonly used due to side effects. Gabapentin is not a first-line prophylactic treatment for migraines.",9
2179,"The study described involves identifying patients with a specific condition (cirrhosis) and comparing them to patients without the condition to assess their prior exposures to potential risk factors. This is characteristic of a case-control study, where the cases are those with the condition and the controls are those without it. The study looks retrospectively at exposures to determine associations with the condition.",9
2178,"The patient exhibits symptoms of mania, including decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, agitation, and grandiosity. She was recently treated for depression, suggesting a possible diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Antidepressants, such as SSRIs like sertraline, can precipitate manic episodes in individuals with bipolar disorder. The timeline of her symptoms aligns with the recent initiation of an antidepressant, making sertraline the most likely precipitant of her manic episode.",9
2132,,0
2181,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with hyperkalemia, which include ascending weakness, palpitations, and decreased bowel sounds. His history of end-stage renal disease and missing dialysis appointments further supports the likelihood of hyperkalemia, as dialysis is crucial for removing excess potassium in these patients. On electrocardiography, hyperkalemia is typically associated with peaked T-waves and a shortened QT interval. Therefore, the most likely finding on ECG in this scenario is peaked T-waves and a shortened QT interval.",9
2189,"The patient is a 75-year-old man with a history of working in construction, specifically with insulation, which raises suspicion for asbestos exposure. His symptoms include difficulty breathing and end-inspiratory crackles at the lung bases, which are indicative of restrictive lung disease. The lung inflation curve, although not visible here, would likely show reduced lung volumes consistent with restrictive disease. Pulmonary fibrosis is a common result of asbestos exposure and would explain the restrictive pattern and crackles. Normal aging, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and asthma are less likely given the occupational exposure and clinical presentation.",9
2195,"The patient presents with fever and abdominal pain 4 days after a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Her vital signs show fever and tachypnea, and physical examination reveals erythema and white discharge from the abdominal incisions, along with tenderness in the right upper quadrant. These findings are suggestive of a wound infection, which is a common cause of postoperative fever occurring 3-7 days after surgery. Pulmonary atelectasis typically causes fever within the first 48 hours postoperatively. Residual gallstones would not typically cause fever and discharge from the incision site. A urinary tract infection is possible but less likely given the specific signs of wound infection. Therefore, the most probable cause of the patient's fever is a wound infection.",9
2192,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of bacterial meningitis: fever, headache, neck stiffness, vomiting, and confusion. The empirical treatment with ceftriaxone and vancomycin covers common bacterial causes such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. The Gram stain result, although not provided here, likely shows Gram-negative diplococci, which is characteristic of Neisseria meningitidis. In cases of meningococcal meningitis, close contacts require prophylaxis to prevent spread. Rifampin is commonly used for this purpose. Therefore, the management should include prophylaxis for close contacts.",9
2194,"The patient is experiencing tardive dyskinesia, a condition characterized by involuntary movements, often due to long-term use of typical antipsychotics like fluphenazine. These drugs are strong dopamine D2 receptor antagonists. Tardive dyskinesia is thought to result from dopamine receptor supersensitivity due to prolonged blockade. Switching to risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic, results in improvement because it has a weaker dopamine D2 antagonism compared to typical antipsychotics. Atypical antipsychotics also have a higher affinity for serotonin receptors, which may help mitigate the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia.",9
2196,"The patient exhibits behaviors and symptoms consistent with an eating disorder. She reports episodes of eating excessive amounts of food and feeling ashamed afterward, which suggests binge eating. The presence of enlarged parotid glands and dental enamel erosion indicates self-induced vomiting, a compensatory behavior often seen in bulimia nervosa. Her BMI is within the normal range, which is more consistent with bulimia nervosa than anorexia nervosa, where patients typically have a significantly low body weight. The history of self-harm and concern about weight further supports a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa. Obsessive-compulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder do not typically present with these specific physical findings or binge-purge behaviors.",9
2199,"The infant described in the scenario has features characteristic of Down syndrome, including a flat face, upward-slanting eyes, short neck, protruding tongue, poor muscle tone, and joint laxity. Down syndrome is caused by trisomy 21. Individuals with Down syndrome have an increased risk of developing certain medical conditions. Among the options provided, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is known to have a higher incidence in children with Down syndrome compared to the general population. Chronic myelogenous leukemia is not typically associated with Down syndrome. Immotile cilia syndrome and macroorchidism are not related to Down syndrome either. Therefore, the condition the infant is most likely to suffer from in the future is acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",9
2201,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of mixed cryoglobulinemia, which is often associated with chronic Hepatitis C infection. The key features include palpable purpura, arthralgias, and positive rheumatoid factor. The presence of Hepatitis C antigen and rheumatoid factor positivity supports this diagnosis. Mixed cryoglobulinemia is caused by the production of cryoglobulins, which are immune complexes that precipitate at low temperatures. These are often composed of polyclonal IgG and monoclonal IgM with rheumatoid factor activity. The underlying mechanism involves virus-induced clonal expansion of autoreactive B lymphocytes, leading to the production of these cryoglobulins. This is consistent with option D.",9
2202,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He has a history of coughing during meals and coughing up undigested food, which indicates a possible issue with swallowing or esophageal function. The productive cough with yellowish-green sputum and right lower lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray are consistent with aspiration pneumonia. The key symptom here is coughing up undigested food, which is indicative of a structural or functional esophageal problem. An outpouching of the hypopharynx, such as a Zenker's diverticulum, can lead to food being trapped and later aspirated, causing recurrent pneumonia. This matches the patient's symptoms and history.",9
2198,"The patient is on a regimen of metformin, sitagliptin, and glipizide, but his HbA1c remains elevated at 8.1%. The goal for most patients with type 2 diabetes is an HbA1c below 7%. Since the current oral regimen is not achieving adequate glycemic control, the next step is to consider adding insulin. Insulin glargine is a long-acting basal insulin that can be added to the current regimen to help control fasting blood glucose levels. Discontinuing glipizide, a sulfonylurea, is reasonable when starting insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. Metformin is typically continued because it has cardiovascular benefits and helps with insulin sensitivity. Sitagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, can also be continued as it has a different mechanism of action and can complement insulin therapy. Therefore, the best option is to discontinue glipizide and initiate insulin glargine.",9
2208,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a perforated peptic ulcer. She has a history of epigastric pain that improved with eating, which is characteristic of a duodenal ulcer. The use of NSAIDs like ibuprofen and alcohol consumption are risk factors for peptic ulcer disease. The acute onset of severe abdominal pain, guarding, and decreased bowel sounds, along with fever and tachycardia, suggest peritonitis, likely due to perforation. The chest x-ray would likely show free air under the diaphragm, indicative of a perforated ulcer.",9
2147,,0
2207,"The patient has symptoms consistent with gonococcal urethritis, caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which are gram-negative intracellular diplococci. The recurrence of infection despite previous treatment suggests that the organism has a mechanism to evade the immune system. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is known for its ability to undergo antigenic variation, particularly in its pilus proteins. This variation allows the bacteria to evade the host's immune response, leading to recurrent infections. The other options do not directly relate to the mechanism of immune evasion and recurrence seen in this case. Expression of beta-lactamase genes (A) would contribute to antibiotic resistance, not immune evasion. Absence of immunogenic proteins (B) is not a known mechanism for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Production of enzymes that hydrolyze urea (C) is related to urease-producing organisms like Helicobacter pylori, not Neisseria gonorrhoeae.",9
2213,"The patient's symptoms are indicative of heart failure, likely congestive heart failure, given the orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and lower extremity swelling. The Starling curve represents the relationship between cardiac output and ventricular end-diastolic volume. A shift from curve A to B suggests an improvement in cardiac output at a given preload, which is characteristic of positive inotropic agents. 

Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that decreases heart rate and contractility, which would not shift the Starling curve to the right. Furosemide is a diuretic that reduces preload by decreasing fluid volume, but it does not directly improve cardiac contractility. Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent and does not affect the Starling curve. Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside that increases cardiac contractility, thereby improving cardiac output at a given preload, which would shift the Starling curve from A to B.

Therefore, the medication that changes the Starling curve from A to B by increasing contractility is Digoxin.",9
2211,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest Horner's syndrome, indicated by the left-sided ptosis and anisocoria with the left pupil being smaller. This is often associated with a Pancoast tumor, which can compress the sympathetic chain and the brachial plexus. The pain radiating down the arm and into the hand, along with tenderness near the neck, supports this diagnosis. A Pancoast tumor typically affects the lower trunk of the brachial plexus, which involves the C8 and T1 nerve roots. These roots contribute to the ulnar nerve, which innervates the little finger. Therefore, the focal neurologic deficit most likely to be seen in this patient would be numbness over her left little finger.",9
2210,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are suggestive of multiple myeloma. The key findings include anemia (low hemoglobin), renal impairment (elevated serum creatinine), and the presence of rouleaux formation (stacks of red blood cells) on the peripheral smear. The serum electrophoresis showing an abnormal protein spike indicates a monoclonal gammopathy, which is characteristic of multiple myeloma. In multiple myeloma, one would expect to find Bence-Jones proteins in the urine, which are free light chains produced by the malignant plasma cells. These proteins can be detected using urine protein electrophoresis.",9
2214,"The patient is a 68-year-old woman with sudden lower back pain, a history of breast cancer, and a spinal fracture at L4. Her lab results show elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) with normal gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and serum calcium levels. She also has sensorineural hearing loss. The elevated ALP with normal GGT suggests a bone source rather than liver. Paget disease of bone is characterized by increased bone turnover, leading to elevated ALP, and can cause bone pain, fractures, and hearing loss due to skull involvement. The normal calcium level and lack of liver symptoms make primary biliary cholangitis unlikely. Type 1 osteopetrosis is a genetic condition presenting earlier in life. Bone metastases could be considered due to her cancer history, but the specific combination of symptoms and lab findings (especially the hearing loss and isolated ALP elevation) is more indicative of Paget disease of bone.",9
2224,"The patient's pap smear shows a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), which is typically associated with changes in the cervical cells due to HPV infection. LSIL is characterized by mild dysplasia, where there is an increase in the number of immature cells in the lower third of the epithelium. This is a precancerous change, but it is not cancer itself. Dysplasia refers to the abnormal development or growth of cells, tissues, or organs, and in this context, it indicates the presence of atypical cells that are not yet invasive. Hypertrophy refers to an increase in cell size, atrophy refers to a decrease in cell size or number, and anaplasia refers to a lack of differentiation, typically seen in malignant tumors. Therefore, the most likely process leading to the LSIL findings is dysplasia.",9
2220,"The patient is a 67-year-old man with bilateral hearing loss that developed over the past week. The Weber test does not localize, and the Rinne test shows air conduction is greater than bone conduction in both ears, indicating sensorineural hearing loss. 

Given the patient's age, presbycusis (age-related hearing loss) is a common cause of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, but it typically develops gradually over years, not suddenly over a week.

The patient has a history of bladder cancer and is currently being treated, which raises the possibility of ototoxicity from medications such as cisplatin or aminoglycosides, which can cause sensorineural hearing loss. This aligns with the sudden onset of symptoms.

Otitis externa and otitis media typically cause conductive hearing loss, not sensorineural, and would likely present with other symptoms such as ear pain or discharge.

Considering the sudden onset of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and the patient's recent cancer treatment, the most likely etiology is ototoxicity from his medication regimen.",9
2222,"The scenario describes a stab wound to the back that affects the spinal cord but does not cross the midline. This suggests a hemisection of the spinal cord, known as Brown-Séquard syndrome. In this condition, the following are typically observed:

1. Ipsilateral loss of tactile, vibration, and proprioception below the level of the lesion due to damage to the dorsal columns.
2. Ipsilateral spastic paralysis below the level of the lesion due to damage to the corticospinal tract.
3. Contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation below the level of the lesion due to damage to the spinothalamic tract, which crosses to the opposite side a few segments above the entry point.
4. Ipsilateral flaccid paralysis at the level of the lesion due to damage to the lower motor neurons at that level.

Given these options, the most likely finding in this patient, considering the wound did not cross the midline, is ipsilateral flaccid paralysis at the level of the lesion due to lower motor neuron damage.",9
2231,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with panic disorder, characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks and intense fear. Individuals with panic disorder often develop agoraphobia, which is the fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult or help might not be available during a panic attack. This can lead to avoidance of certain places or situations. The most likely risk associated with panic disorder is the development of agoraphobia, which is not directly listed in the options. However, panic disorder can also lead to depression due to the distress and impairment caused by the condition. Therefore, the patient is at greatest risk of developing depressed mood and feelings of guilt as a consequence of his panic disorder.",9
2240,"The presentation of craniofacial abnormalities such as micrognathia, cleft lip, cleft palate, downward slanting eyes, and malformed ears suggests a condition affecting facial development. Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) can present with some craniofacial abnormalities, but it is also associated with other systemic issues, including cardiac defects, which are not present here. A mutation in the SOX9 gene is associated with campomelic dysplasia, which involves skeletal abnormalities, not primarily craniofacial features. A microdeletion at chromosome 22q14 is not a recognized syndrome associated with these features. The TCOF1 gene mutation is associated with Treacher Collins syndrome, which is characterized by the craniofacial abnormalities described, including micrognathia, cleft palate, downward slanting eyes, and malformed ears. Therefore, the most likely cause of this presentation is a mutation in the TCOF1 gene.",9
2245,"The patient presents with back pain, fever, and neurological symptoms (decreased muscle strength in the lower extremities), which raises suspicion for a spinal epidural abscess or vertebral osteomyelitis. Her history of breast cancer and recent fall could also suggest metastatic disease, but the acute presentation with fever and leukocytosis is more indicative of an infectious process. An MRI of the spine is the most appropriate next step as it is the best imaging modality to evaluate for spinal infections, including epidural abscesses and osteomyelitis. X-rays are less sensitive for early changes in infection, and serum protein electrophoresis is not immediately relevant. Antibiotic therapy should be guided by imaging and cultures.",9
2249,"The patient presents with confusion, jaundice, abdominal pain, and laboratory findings suggestive of liver dysfunction, including elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy (prolonged PT and PTT), and hypoglycemia. The presence of a flapping tremor (asterixis) indicates hepatic encephalopathy. The negative viral hepatitis serologies rule out acute viral hepatitis B. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy typically presents with pruritus and elevated bile acids, not severe liver dysfunction or encephalopathy. Preeclampsia is unlikely given the normal blood pressure and lack of proteinuria. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) is characterized by liver dysfunction, coagulopathy, hypoglycemia, and encephalopathy, which matches this patient's presentation. AFLP is a rare but serious condition that can occur in the third trimester of pregnancy.",9
2258,"The patient presents with signs of hypovolemic shock (hypotension, tachycardia, cool extremities) and peritoneal irritation (abdominal distension, tenderness, rebound tenderness) following a gunshot wound to the abdomen. These findings suggest intra-abdominal bleeding or injury. In a hemodynamically unstable patient with a penetrating abdominal injury, immediate surgical intervention is typically required. While FAST or diagnostic peritoneal lavage can be used to assess for intra-abdominal bleeding, the clinical presentation here strongly indicates the need for urgent surgical exploration to control hemorrhage and repair any injuries. Therefore, the next best step in management is exploratory laparotomy.",9
2264,"The patient's symptoms suggest a diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome. The key symptoms include dry mouth (xerostomia), dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca), and joint pain with morning stiffness. Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disorder characterized by these symptoms due to lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands. The serological markers most commonly associated with Sjögren's syndrome are anti-Ro (SSA) and anti-La (SSB) antibodies. The other options are associated with different conditions: anti-centromere antibodies are linked to limited scleroderma (CREST syndrome), anti-CCP antibodies are associated with rheumatoid arthritis, and anti-Jo1 and anti-Mi2 antibodies are linked to polymyositis and dermatomyositis.",9
2260,"The patient presents with right-sided gaze deviation, decreased sensation to light touch on the right leg, and significant weakness in the left leg and foot (3+ in the left hip and thigh, 2+ in the left leg and foot). These findings suggest a motor deficit primarily affecting the left lower extremity, which is consistent with an infarct in the territory of the right anterior cerebral artery (ACA). The ACA supplies the medial portions of the frontal lobes and the superior medial parietal lobes, which are responsible for motor control of the contralateral lower extremity. The right-sided gaze deviation and apathy could be explained by frontal lobe involvement. The absence of facial asymmetry and the presence of normal upper extremity strength make a middle cerebral artery occlusion less likely, as MCA strokes typically affect the face and upper extremities more prominently.",9
2267,"The patient's symptoms and history are suggestive of Wernicke's encephalopathy, which is associated with thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, often seen in individuals with alcohol use disorder. The classic triad of Wernicke's encephalopathy includes confusion, ophthalmoplegia (eye movement abnormalities), and ataxia (unsteady gait). The autopsy finding most characteristic of Wernicke's encephalopathy is small vessel hemorrhage and necrosis in the mammillary bodies. This aligns with the patient's symptoms of confusion, unsteady gait, and eye movement abnormalities, as well as his history of alcohol use disorder and poor nutritional status.",9
2266,"The patient has end-stage renal disease and is on hemodialysis. She was recently started on erythropoietin for anemia. Erythropoietin therapy is known to cause hypertension as a side effect, likely due to increased blood viscosity and possibly direct effects on vascular smooth muscle. Her blood pressure was previously normal, and the recent initiation of erythropoietin aligns with the onset of hypertension. Calcitriol therapy is not typically associated with causing hypertension. Autonomic neuropathy could cause blood pressure changes, but it is less likely to cause a sudden increase in blood pressure. Hypervolemia could cause hypertension, but the patient is on regular dialysis, which should manage fluid balance. Therefore, the most likely cause of the new onset hypertension in this patient is erythropoietin therapy.",9
2270,"The patient presents with symptoms and physical exam findings suggestive of aortic stenosis. The harsh crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur heard over the right sternal border with radiation to the carotids is characteristic of aortic stenosis. In aortic stenosis, the left ventricular outflow obstruction can lead to delayed closure of the aortic valve, which can cause a paradoxical splitting of the second heart sound (S2). Normally, the aortic valve closes before the pulmonic valve, but in severe aortic stenosis, the closure of the aortic valve is delayed, causing the pulmonic valve to close first, leading to a paradoxical split S2. Therefore, the most likely additional finding in this patient is a paradoxically split S2.",9
2272,"The patient presents with fever, lower abdominal pain, malodorous lochia, and uterine tenderness 4 days after a cesarean delivery. These symptoms are highly suggestive of endometritis, which is an infection of the uterine lining. The presence of foul-smelling lochia and uterine tenderness are classic signs of this condition. Pyelonephritis is less likely given the absence of urinary symptoms. Normal postpartum fever typically occurs within the first 24 hours and is not associated with foul-smelling lochia or uterine tenderness. Chorioamnionitis is an infection of the fetal membranes and amniotic fluid, which occurs before or during delivery, not after.",9
2235,,0
2271,"The symptoms presented in the question include multiple nosebleeds, frequent infections, bruising, dry-itching skin, and splenomegaly. These symptoms are suggestive of a condition that affects both the immune system and platelet function. Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) is characterized by the triad of eczema, recurrent infections, and thrombocytopenia (which can lead to easy bruising and bleeding such as nosebleeds). The presence of splenomegaly can also be associated with WAS due to the sequestration of platelets. The other options do not fit the combination of symptoms as well as WAS does. X-linked Agammaglobulinemia primarily presents with recurrent infections but not eczema or bleeding issues. Severe Combined Immunodeficiency would present with severe infections but not necessarily with eczema or bleeding. Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome is characterized by recurrent infections and eczema but not typically with bleeding issues or splenomegaly.",9

2273,"The patient presents with symptoms of hyponatremia, as indicated by her serum sodium level of 120 mEq/L. Her symptoms include confusion, urinary incontinence, and gait disturbances, which are consistent with hyponatremia. The treatment for hyponatremia involves careful correction of the sodium levels. If the sodium is corrected too rapidly, it can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS), also known as central pontine myelinolysis. This occurs because rapid correction causes water to move out of brain cells, leading to demyelination. Therefore, the complication associated with treatment of this patient, if not done carefully, is osmotic demyelination.",9
2281,"The patient's symptoms of recurrent retrosternal chest pain and dysphagia for both solids and liquids, along with a normal barium swallow, suggest a motility disorder of the esophagus. The fact that the symptoms persist despite proton pump inhibitor therapy and are not related to exertion further supports this. Manometry is the test of choice to evaluate esophageal motility disorders, such as achalasia or diffuse esophageal spasm, which can cause these symptoms. An electrocardiogram would be more relevant if cardiac causes were suspected, and an upper GI endoscopy is typically used to evaluate structural abnormalities or mucosal disease, which are less likely given the normal barium swallow. Additional proton pump inhibitor therapy is unlikely to be beneficial given the lack of response to the initial course.",9
2288,"The patient presents with symptoms and endoscopic findings consistent with peptic ulcer disease, and the biopsy confirms the presence of Helicobacter pylori. The standard treatment for H. pylori infection involves a combination of antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to eradicate the bacteria and promote ulcer healing. The most common regimen is triple therapy, which includes a PPI (such as omeprazole), clarithromycin, and amoxicillin. This combination is effective in eradicating H. pylori and allowing the ulcer to heal. Erythromycin is not typically used in standard H. pylori eradication regimens. Therefore, the best next step is to start the patient on amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and omeprazole.",9
2293,"Long-term use of prednisone, a corticosteroid, is associated with several side effects. One of the most significant risks is the development of osteoporosis, which can lead to pathologic fractures. Corticosteroids decrease bone formation and increase bone resorption, leading to weakened bones. Weight gain, not weight loss, is a common side effect of prednisone. Pancreatic insufficiency is not typically associated with prednisone use. Systolic hypertension can occur with corticosteroid use, but the risk of pathologic fractures due to osteoporosis is more directly linked to long-term prednisone use.",9
2286,"The patient's hepatitis B panel shows the following results:

- HBV DNA positive: Indicates active viral replication.
- HBsAg negative: Suggests that the surface antigen is not present, which typically rules out active infection.
- HBeAg negative: Indicates low infectivity or a resolved infection.
- HBsAb negative: Suggests no immunity from vaccine or recovery.
- HBcAb positive: Indicates past or current infection.
- HBeAb negative: No antibodies against the e antigen, suggesting no resolution of infection.

The presence of HBV DNA with negative HBsAg and positive HBcAb suggests that the patient is in the convalescent (window) period. During this period, HBsAg has disappeared, but HBsAb has not yet appeared. The presence of HBV DNA indicates ongoing viral replication, which can occur in the window period before the immune system clears the virus completely.",9
2294,"The patient is a 17-year-old girl who is sexually active and uses condoms inconsistently. Given her age and sexual activity, the most appropriate screening test is for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is used to screen for common STIs such as Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which are prevalent in sexually active adolescents. A PAP smear is not recommended until age 21, regardless of sexual activity. Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) is used for syphilis screening, which is not as routinely indicated in this scenario without specific risk factors. Herpes simplex virus 2 serology is not recommended for routine screening in asymptomatic individuals. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is nucleic acid amplification testing for STIs.",9
2296,"The patient's symptoms and findings are suggestive of myocarditis, likely due to a viral infection. The key findings include chest pain exacerbated by inspiration, a pericardial friction rub (scratchy sound), diffuse ST-elevations with PR depression on EKG, and left ventricular dysfunction on echocardiogram. These are classic signs of pericarditis and myocarditis. The most common viral cause of myocarditis is Coxsackie B virus, which is a type of Picornavirus. The negative rapid influenza test and the presentation further support a non-influenza viral cause, making Picornavirus the most likely pathogen.",9
2300,"The patient presents with altered mental status and a history of multiple hospital admissions for conditions related to liver dysfunction, such as acute pancreatitis and coagulopathy (evidenced by prolonged PT and PTT). The low albumin level and normal AST/ALT suggest chronic liver disease, likely due to alcohol abuse, given the history of IV drug use and social circumstances. The prolonged PT and PTT indicate a deficiency in clotting factors, which are produced by the liver. The most definitive treatment for end-stage liver disease is a liver transplant, as it addresses the underlying pathology of liver failure and its complications, including coagulopathy.",9
2297,"The patient's presentation includes chest pain, shortness of breath, and a small left-sided pleural effusion with bloody fluid. The pleural fluid analysis shows a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level lower than the serum LDH and a high protein content, suggesting an exudative effusion. The bloody nature of the fluid and the normal cell morphology on cytology suggest a non-malignant cause. 

Considering the options:

A. Oropharyngeal dysphagia is unlikely to cause a bloody pleural effusion.

B. Infliximab use is associated with drug-induced lupus or infections, but these are less likely to present with a bloody effusion without other systemic symptoms.

C. Prolonged immobilization can lead to deep vein thrombosis and subsequent pulmonary embolism, which can cause a bloody pleural effusion due to infarction or inflammation.

D. Congestive heart failure typically causes transudative effusions, not exudative or bloody ones.

Given the bloody nature of the effusion and the exudative characteristics, a history of prolonged immobilization leading to pulmonary embolism is the most likely scenario.",9
2301,"The patient is a 75-year-old man with painless hematuria and a significant smoking history. The urinalysis shows blood and a high number of red blood cells without signs of infection or casts, suggesting a non-glomerular source of bleeding. Given the age, smoking history, and presentation, there is a high suspicion for bladder cancer. The most appropriate initial diagnostic study to evaluate for bladder cancer is cystoscopy, as it allows direct visualization of the bladder and urethra to identify any tumors or lesions.",9
2305,"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of dermatomyositis, which is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and distinctive skin rashes such as the heliotrope rash (violaceous rash over the eyelids) and Gottron's papules (flat-topped erythematous papules over the joints). Dermatomyositis is known to be associated with an increased risk of malignancies. Among the options provided, dermatomyositis is most commonly associated with ovarian adenocarcinoma, particularly in women. Therefore, this patient is at greatest risk for developing ovarian adenocarcinoma.",9
2309,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of Cushing's syndrome, characterized by elevated cortisol levels. The low ACTH level indicates ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome, likely due to an adrenal source. In such cases, the most common cause is an adrenal adenoma or carcinoma. To confirm the presence of an adrenal mass, an imaging study of the adrenal glands is warranted. Therefore, an abdominal CT scan is the appropriate test to identify an adrenal tumor, which would explain the ACTH-independent hypercortisolism.",9
2307,"The patient presents with blood in the stool, a history of left lower quadrant pain and fever that resolved with antibiotics, and a positive fecal occult blood test. He also has microcytic anemia (low hemoglobin and low mean corpuscular volume) and increased red cell distribution width, suggesting iron deficiency anemia, likely due to chronic blood loss. The history of left lower quadrant pain and fever that resolved with antibiotics is suggestive of diverticulitis, which is a complication of diverticulosis. Diverticulosis itself can cause painless rectal bleeding, especially in older adults. The previous colonoscopy did not show malignancy, making colorectal carcinoma less likely. Hemorrhoids typically cause bright red blood on toilet paper but are less likely to cause significant anemia. Pseudomembranous colitis is associated with antibiotic use but typically presents with diarrhea, not constipation or blood in stool. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is diverticulosis.",9
2306,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency, including macrocytic anemia and neurological symptoms (reduced sensation in the toes). The Schilling test, which involves administering radiolabeled vitamin B12 and measuring its excretion in the urine, shows that the deficiency is due to a lack of intrinsic factor, as the addition of intrinsic factor corrects the absorption issue. This indicates pernicious anemia, an autoimmune condition where the stomach lining is damaged, leading to a lack of intrinsic factor production. Patients with pernicious anemia have an increased risk of gastric carcinoma due to chronic atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia associated with the condition.",10
2310,"The patient's presentation includes ascites, a hypoechoic ovarian mass, and spindle-shaped cells on biopsy. These findings are suggestive of Meigs' syndrome, which is characterized by the triad of ovarian fibroma, ascites, and pleural effusion. Ovarian fibromas are benign tumors that can present with these symptoms. The spindle-shaped cells seen on biopsy are consistent with the fibrous tissue found in fibromas. Other options like serous cystadenoma, endometrioma, and dermoid cyst do not typically present with spindle-shaped cells or the associated ascites and pleural effusion seen in Meigs' syndrome.",9
2315,"The patient has a DEXA scan result indicating osteoporosis (2 standard deviations below the mean). Given her history of breast and endometrial cancer, a medication that avoids estrogenic effects on the uterus would be preferred. Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that acts as an estrogen receptor antagonist in the uterus, which is beneficial for patients with a history of estrogen-sensitive cancers. This medication can also cause hot flashes, which aligns with her symptoms of feeling febrile/warm. Therefore, the medication she was likely started on is raloxifene, making option B the correct answer.",9
2313,"The study described in the question is looking at the association between a high BMI (>40) and the diagnosis of diabetes, using an odds ratio. This suggests a case-control study design, where the odds of having a high BMI are compared between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. 

- Option A describes a case-control study design, where 500 patients with diabetes and 500 without diabetes are compared based on their BMI. This is consistent with the use of odds ratios to measure association.

- Option B describes an experimental study with mice, which is not relevant to the human study described.

- Option C describes an interventional study focusing on treatment outcomes, not the association between BMI and diabetes.

- Option D describes a cross-sectional study, which could potentially use odds ratios, but it doesn't specify the comparison of BMI between diabetic and non-diabetic groups as clearly as Option A.

Therefore, Option A is the most likely study design to yield the results described.",9
2329,"Metoclopramide is a prokinetic and antiemetic agent. It works primarily by antagonizing dopamine D2 receptors. In the context of nausea and vomiting, metoclopramide's antiemetic effect is largely due to its action on the central nervous system, specifically by inhibiting dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) located in the area postrema of the brain. This action helps reduce nausea and vomiting. While metoclopramide also enhances gastrointestinal motility, the relief from nausea and vomiting in this scenario is best explained by its central action on dopamine receptors.",9
2327,"The infant presents with classic signs of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, including projectile non-bilious vomiting, a palpable epigastric mass (often described as an ""olive""), and visible peristaltic waves. The barium study showing a ""double channel"" appearance (string sign) further supports this diagnosis. The immediate concern in such cases is dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis due to loss of gastric acid from vomiting. Before surgical intervention (pyloromyotomy), it is crucial to stabilize the patient by correcting these imbalances. Therefore, the best immediate step is to correct the electrolyte imbalances.",9
2323,"To determine how many participants have a systolic blood pressure between 126 and 154 mmHg, we need to calculate the z-scores for these values and use the properties of the normal distribution.

1. **Calculate the z-scores:**
   - For 126 mmHg: \( z = \frac{126 - 140}{7} = \frac{-14}{7} = -2 \)
   - For 154 mmHg: \( z = \frac{154 - 140}{7} = \frac{14}{7} = 2 \)

2. **Use the standard normal distribution table:**
   - The z-score of -2 corresponds to approximately 2.5% of the data below this value.
   - The z-score of 2 corresponds to approximately 97.5% of the data below this value.

3. **Calculate the percentage of participants between these z-scores:**
   - The percentage of participants between z = -2 and z = 2 is approximately 97.5% - 2.5% = 95%.

4. **Calculate the number of participants:**
   - 95% of 60 participants is \( 0.95 \times 60 = 57 \) participants.

Therefore, we expect 57 participants to have a systolic blood pressure between 126 and 154 mmHg.",10
2324,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of Cushing's syndrome, such as hypertension, centripetal obesity, and striae. The visual field defect suggests a pituitary adenoma, likely causing Cushing's disease due to excess ACTH production. In Cushing's disease, ACTH levels are elevated due to a pituitary adenoma. The low-dose dexamethasone suppression test is positive, indicating cortisol production is not suppressed at low doses. The high-dose dexamethasone suppression test is used to differentiate between pituitary and ectopic sources of ACTH. In pituitary Cushing's disease, high-dose dexamethasone suppresses cortisol production because the pituitary adenoma is partially responsive to feedback inhibition. Therefore, before the test, ACTH is high, and after the high-dose test, cortisol is suppressed.",9
2330,"The patient is experiencing an acute asthma exacerbation, likely triggered by exposure to dust. In such cases, the goal is to provide quick relief of bronchospasm. Inhaled albuterol is a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) that acts rapidly to relax bronchial smooth muscle and relieve acute symptoms. Inhaled fluticasone is a corticosteroid used for long-term control and prevention of asthma symptoms, not for immediate relief. Inhaled cromolyn is a mast cell stabilizer used for prevention, not acute treatment. Oral montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist used for long-term control, not for immediate relief. Therefore, inhaled albuterol is the most appropriate choice for quick relief in this scenario.",9
2338,"The patient has a history of recurrent miscarriages and presents with a violaceous, reticular rash on the lower extremities, thrombocytopenia, and prolonged partial thromboplastin time. These findings, along with the positive anti-beta 2 glycoprotein-1 antibody, suggest antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). APS is associated with recurrent pregnancy loss and requires anticoagulation therapy to prevent further miscarriages. The standard treatment for pregnant women with APS is low-dose aspirin and low molecular weight heparin (such as enoxaparin) to reduce the risk of miscarriage. Warfarin is contraindicated in pregnancy due to teratogenic effects, and heparin alone is not sufficient. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to start aspirin and enoxaparin.",9
2337,"The patient has COPD with signs of right ventricular hypertrophy, suggesting pulmonary hypertension. The medication given likely targets pulmonary hypertension. The improvement in symptoms and the elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) suggest a medication with known hepatotoxicity. Bosentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist, is used to treat pulmonary hypertension and is known for causing liver enzyme elevation. Therefore, the mechanism of action of the likely medication is competitive inhibition of endothelin-1 receptors.",9
2345,"To determine the area of the stenotic aortic valve, we can use the continuity equation, which is based on the principle of conservation of mass. The equation is:

A1 * V1 = A2 * V2

Where:
- A1 is the area of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), which is given as 30.6 mm².
- V1 is the velocity in the LVOT, which is 1.0 m/s.
- A2 is the area of the stenotic aortic valve, which we need to find.
- V2 is the peak velocity across the aortic valve, which is 3.0 m/s.

Rearranging the equation to solve for A2:

A2 = (A1 * V1) / V2

Substitute the given values:

A2 = (30.6 mm² * 1.0 m/s) / 3.0 m/s

A2 = 30.6 mm² / 3

A2 = 10.2 mm²

Therefore, the area of the stenotic aortic valve is 10.2 mm².",9
2352,"The newborn presents with symptoms of vomiting, jitteriness, poor feeding, and hypothermia. The laboratory findings show a high hematocrit (70%), which indicates polycythemia. The glucose level is low (38 mg/dL), indicating hypoglycemia. The oxygen saturation is low at 92%, and the baby has pale extremities with a prolonged capillary refill time, suggesting poor perfusion. The mother smoked during pregnancy, which can lead to intrauterine hypoxia. Intrauterine hypoxia can cause increased erythropoietin production, leading to polycythemia in the newborn. The combination of polycythemia and hypoglycemia is consistent with intrauterine hypoxia as the underlying cause. Other options like intraventricular hemorrhage, hyperinsulinism, and congenital heart disease do not fully explain the polycythemia and the specific combination of symptoms and lab findings.",9
2349,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with cholinergic toxicity, likely due to an overdose of a cholinesterase inhibitor used for Alzheimer's disease, such as donepezil. The symptoms include bradycardia, hypotension, excessive salivation, tearing, diarrhea, and muscle spasms. Atropine, an anticholinergic, is used to counteract the muscarinic effects, which explains the resolution of most symptoms. However, atropine does not affect the nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction, which are responsible for the muscular spasms. Pralidoxime (2-PAM) is used to regenerate acetylcholinesterase and is effective at reversing both muscarinic and nicotinic effects, including muscle spasms, in cases of organophosphate poisoning or similar cholinergic crises. Therefore, the next step is to administer pralidoxime to address the persistent muscular spasms.",9
2354,"The clinical presentation suggests Reye syndrome, which is associated with aspirin use in children recovering from viral infections. The key features include acute encephalopathy and liver dysfunction. The liver biopsy in Reye syndrome typically shows microvesicular steatosis, characterized by small fat vacuoles in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes without displacement of the nucleus. This is distinct from macrovesicular steatosis, which involves larger fat vacuoles that displace the nucleus. The history of multiple medications to reduce fever raises suspicion of aspirin use, which aligns with the diagnosis of Reye syndrome.",9
2363,"The patient presents with acute weakness of the left leg, suggesting a possible stroke affecting the right side of the brain, specifically the area controlling the left leg. The sudden onset of symptoms and the presence of atrial fibrillation increase the likelihood of an embolic stroke. 

The question describes cellular changes occurring within one minute of symptom onset, indicating an acute process. In the context of an acute ischemic event, the immediate cellular response is due to a lack of blood supply, leading to hypoxia and a rapid depletion of ATP. 

ATP depletion occurs because oxygen is required for oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria, and without oxygen, ATP production ceases. This leads to failure of energy-dependent processes, such as ion pumps, causing cellular swelling due to osmotic imbalances. This swelling is the enlargement of cells described in the question.

Other options like rupture of lysosomes, release of pro-apoptotic proteins, and breakdown of the cell membrane are later events in the cascade of cell injury and death, not immediate changes within one minute of ischemia.

Therefore, the most likely explanation for the cellular enlargement is intracellular depletion of ATP.",9
2366,"The patient presents with symptoms and imaging findings suggestive of a bowel obstruction. The key details include progressively worsening abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, inability to pass flatus, and a CT scan showing dilated loops of small bowel with collapsed large bowel. These findings are consistent with a small bowel obstruction.

The most common causes of small bowel obstruction in adults are adhesions, hernias, and tumors. In this case, the gradual onset of symptoms over 2 months and the patient's age make a mass effect from a tumor more likely. Adhesions typically cause more acute presentations and are often related to a history of abdominal surgery, which is not mentioned here. Incarcerated hernias can cause obstruction but would likely present more acutely. Crohn's disease is less likely given the patient's age and lack of prior history.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition, given the gradual progression and the patient's age, is a mass effect from a tumor.",9
2357,"The patient's symptoms of tinnitus, headache, visual disturbances, and severe diarrhea, along with the ECG findings of multifocal ventricular tachycardia with continuous change in the QRS electrical axis, suggest a condition known as ""quinidine toxicity"" or ""cinchonism."" Quinidine is an antiarrhythmic medication that can cause these symptoms as side effects. The specific ECG finding described is consistent with torsades de pointes, a type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that can occur with quinidine use due to its potential to prolong the QT interval. The other drugs listed do not typically cause this combination of symptoms and ECG changes.",9
2368,"The patient has developed symptoms consistent with cardiotoxicity, likely due to the chemotherapeutic regimen she received for breast cancer. Invasive ductal carcinoma is often treated with anthracyclines like doxorubicin, which are known to cause cardiotoxicity, leading to conditions such as dilated cardiomyopathy. Dexrazoxane is a cardioprotective agent that is used to prevent doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. It acts by chelating iron and reducing the formation of free radicals that damage cardiac tissue. The other options do not prevent chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity: Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent, Rosuvastatin is a statin used for cholesterol management, and Cyclophosphamide is another chemotherapeutic agent that does not prevent cardiotoxicity. Therefore, the correct answer is Dexrazoxane.",9
2370,"The positive predictive value (PPV) of a test is the probability that a person with a positive test result actually has the disease. PPV is influenced by the prevalence of the disease in the population, as well as the sensitivity and specificity of the test. An increase in prevalence leads to an increase in PPV because there are more true positive cases relative to false positives. Changes in incidence do not directly affect PPV unless they alter prevalence. Lowering the threshold concentration would increase sensitivity but decrease specificity, likely reducing PPV due to more false positives.",9
2365,"The patient presents with confusion, lethargy, and a very high blood glucose level (910 mg/dL), which suggests hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), a complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus. HHS is characterized by severe hyperglycemia, dehydration, and altered mental status, often without significant ketosis (as indicated by trace urine ketones). The laboratory findings also show hyponatremia, which can occur due to hyperglycemia causing osmotic shifts. The history of recent vomiting and diarrhea, along with the use of hydrochlorothiazide, suggests dehydration, which is consistent with HHS. In HHS, dehydration leads to an increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to creatinine ratio due to prerenal azotemia. Therefore, an increased BUN/creatinine ratio is likely to be found in this patient.",9
2371,"The newborn in this scenario presents with clinical features consistent with congenital talipes equinovarus, commonly known as clubfoot. The key features include the feet pointing downwards and inwards, forefeet twisted medially, hindfeet elevated, concave midfeet, taut Achilles tendons, and medial skin creases. The deformity is rigid and does not correct with passive manipulation. The standard initial treatment for clubfoot is the Ponseti method, which involves repositioning and serial casting to gradually correct the deformity. Surgery is typically reserved for cases that do not respond to conservative treatment. Physiotherapy and foot abduction braces are not the initial steps in management. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is repositioning and serial casting.",9
2382,"In a young man presenting with impotence, it is important to determine whether the cause is psychological or physiological. Evaluating nocturnal penile tumescence can help differentiate between these causes. If nocturnal erections are present, it suggests a psychological cause, whereas their absence may indicate a physiological issue. This evaluation is non-invasive and provides valuable diagnostic information before proceeding to more invasive tests or treatments.",9
2374,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest diabetic nephropathy. The key findings include heavy proteinuria, elevated hemoglobin A1c indicating poorly controlled diabetes, and diminished two-point discrimination suggesting diabetic neuropathy. In diabetic nephropathy, the characteristic histological finding on kidney biopsy is nodular glomerulosclerosis, also known as Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules. This is due to the accumulation of extracellular matrix in the glomeruli as a result of chronic hyperglycemia. The other options are more characteristic of different conditions: immune complex deposition is seen in conditions like lupus nephritis, interstitial inflammation is seen in interstitial nephritis, and wire looping of capillaries is also associated with lupus nephritis.",9
2397,"The patient has oliguria (low urine output) and signs of volume depletion (dry mucous membranes, flat neck veins) following surgery, along with an elevated BUN-to-creatinine ratio (48/2 = 24). These findings suggest prerenal azotemia, likely due to decreased renal perfusion. In prerenal azotemia, the kidneys attempt to conserve sodium to maintain intravascular volume, leading to low urine sodium concentration. Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient would be low urine sodium.",9
2398,"The child's episodes are characterized by sudden arousal from sleep with intense fear, screaming, and physical activity (kicking), along with autonomic signs like sweating and fast breathing. Importantly, the child has no memory of the events upon waking. These features are consistent with sleep terrors, which occur during non-REM sleep and are common in children. Nightmare disorder, on the other hand, involves vivid recall of the dream upon waking, which is not the case here. Sleepwalking involves complex behaviors during sleep but does not typically involve the intense fear and autonomic arousal seen in sleep terrors. Insomnia disorder is characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, which is not described in this scenario. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is sleep terror disorder.",9
2404,"In a patient with esophageal varices due to cirrhosis, the primary goal is to prevent variceal bleeding. Non-selective beta-blockers, such as nadolol or propranolol, are the first-line treatment for primary prophylaxis against variceal bleeding. These medications work by reducing portal hypertension, which is the underlying cause of varices. Isosorbide mononitrate is not typically used as a first-line agent for primary prophylaxis. A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is generally reserved for patients who have already experienced variceal bleeding or have refractory ascites. Careful observation alone is not sufficient for prevention. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to start the patient on a non-selective beta-blocker like nadolol.",9
2405,"The clinical presentation described in the vignette is consistent with Kawasaki disease, which is characterized by prolonged fever, conjunctivitis, rash, cervical lymphadenopathy, changes in the lips and oral cavity, and changes in the extremities. The most worrisome complication of Kawasaki disease is the development of coronary artery aneurysms, which can lead to significant cardiac issues, including myocardial infarction in children. While other complications like digital gangrene and endocardial valve damage can occur, they are less common and not as characteristic of Kawasaki disease as coronary artery aneurysms. Toxic endodermal necrolysis is not associated with Kawasaki disease.",9
2406,"The patient's symptoms and clinical findings are suggestive of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which is often caused by sexually transmitted infections. The key symptoms include severe lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, painful intercourse, painful urination, and fever. The pelvic examination reveals a mucopurulent cervical discharge and cervical motion tenderness, which are classic signs of PID. The patient's sexual history of multiple partners increases the risk of sexually transmitted infections. 

Neisseria gonorrhoeae (option A) and Chlamydia trachomatis are the most common causes of PID. The presence of mucopurulent discharge and cervical motion tenderness strongly suggests an infection with one of these organisms. While Chlamydia trachomatis is not listed as an option, Neisseria gonorrhoeae is, making it the most likely cause among the given options.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (option B) can cause pelvic inflammatory disease, but it is much less common and typically presents with a more chronic course.

Mycoplasma genitalium (option C) can also cause PID, but it is less common than Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis.

Streptococcus agalactiae (option D) is not typically associated with PID.

Therefore, the most likely cause of her condition is Neisseria gonorrhoeae.",9
2409,"The patient's symptoms are indicative of Broca's aphasia, characterized by non-fluent speech, intact comprehension, and impaired repetition. This condition typically results from damage to Broca's area, which is located in the inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere (usually the left hemisphere in right-handed individuals). The patient's ability to comprehend instructions but inability to repeat phrases aligns with this diagnosis. The CT showing an acute stroke in the left hemisphere supports this localization. Damage to the arcuate fasciculus would result in conduction aphasia, which presents with fluent speech and impaired repetition, not matching this patient's symptoms. The watershed zone is associated with transcortical aphasias, which also do not match this presentation. The precentral gyrus is involved in motor control, not language.",9
2410,"The patient experienced a transient ischemic attack (TIA), as indicated by the sudden onset of neurological symptoms that resolved within a short period. The CT angiography shows significant stenosis (80%) of the left internal carotid artery, which is a risk factor for future strokes. In patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis of 70-99%, carotid endarterectomy is recommended to reduce the risk of stroke. While medical management with aspirin and statins is important, the significant stenosis and recent TIA make surgical intervention the priority for long-term management.",9
2413,"The patient is a 62-year-old man with a persistent cough and occasional chest discomfort. He has a significant smoking history and a family history of myocardial infarction. The recent symptoms of sore throat, headache, and low-grade fever suggest a possible respiratory infection. However, the question provides an x-ray of the chest, which likely shows an abnormality that needs further investigation. Given the options, a CT scan of the chest is the most appropriate next step to further evaluate any potential findings on the chest x-ray, such as a mass, nodule, or other abnormalities that could explain his symptoms. Esophageal manometry is used for esophageal motility disorders, arteriography is for vascular issues, and endovascular repair is a treatment, not a diagnostic step.",9
2424,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a posterior vaginal wall prolapse, also known as a rectocele. This condition is characterized by the bulging of the posterior vaginal wall, which is consistent with the description of the bulging observed during the gynecological examination. The rectovaginal fascia is the connective tissue that supports the posterior vaginal wall and separates the vagina from the rectum. Damage or weakening of the rectovaginal fascia can lead to a rectocele, as it allows the rectum to protrude into the vaginal space, causing the symptoms of pelvic pressure, dyspareunia (pain during intercourse), and lower back pain. The other structures listed, such as the cardinal ligaments, round ligaments, and uterosacral ligaments, are more involved in supporting the uterus and cervix, and their damage would not typically result in a rectocele.",9
2428,"The patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis, as indicated by hand pain, stiffness, subcutaneous nodules, and joint deformities. The laboratory findings show pancytopenia (anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia). The normal methylmalonic acid level suggests that vitamin B12 deficiency is not the cause of the anemia. The pancytopenia is likely due to bone marrow suppression, which can be a side effect of methotrexate, a common medication used in rheumatoid arthritis that was likely started 4 months ago. Methotrexate can cause folate deficiency, leading to bone marrow suppression. Leucovorin (folinic acid) is used to prevent or reduce the side effects of methotrexate by providing a source of folate. Therefore, leucovorin could have prevented the laboratory abnormalities.",9
2432,"The patient's symptoms and test results suggest Cushing's disease, which is caused by an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma. The key findings include elevated cortisol levels, normal ACTH levels after low-dose dexamethasone suppression, and suppression of ACTH with high-dose dexamethasone. This pattern indicates a pituitary source of ACTH, leading to bilateral adrenal hyperplasia due to increased ACTH stimulation. The zona fasciculata is primarily responsible for cortisol production, so bilateral hyperplasia of this zone is expected.",9
2434,"The patient's history of chronic alcohol use and the symptoms of jaundice and hepatosplenomegaly suggest alcoholic liver disease. The liver biopsy in such cases typically shows steatosis (fatty liver), which is due to the accumulation of fat within hepatocytes. This occurs because alcohol metabolism increases the NADH/NAD+ ratio, leading to increased conversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glycerol 3-phosphate. Glycerol 3-phosphate is a substrate for triglyceride synthesis, resulting in fat accumulation in the liver. Therefore, the mechanism that best explains the findings is increased glycerol 3-phosphate formation.",9
2429,"The patient's symptoms suggest internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), which is characterized by impaired adduction of the affected eye (right eye in this case) and nystagmus in the abducting eye (left eye). This condition is often due to a lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), commonly associated with multiple sclerosis in young adults. The right adduction palsy on leftward gaze indicates a right MLF lesion. The associated finding would be horizontal nystagmus in the left eye on leftward gaze, as the left eye attempts to compensate for the impaired adduction of the right eye.",9
2439,"The patient is experiencing flushing and a stinging sensation on her face after starting niacin. Niacin is known to cause flushing due to the release of prostaglandins, which leads to vasodilation. This is a common side effect and not an allergic reaction. The advice to take aspirin before niacin is to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, thereby reducing the flushing. The absence of other allergic symptoms and the reassurance from the physician further support that this is a niacin-induced prostaglandin-mediated reaction rather than an allergic reaction or anxiety. Therefore, the etiology of her symptoms is prostaglandin release.",9
2438,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with peripheral neuropathy, including numbness in the hands and feet, decreased 2-point discrimination, and absent ankle reflexes. The presence of a sore, smooth tongue suggests glossitis, which can be associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. The positive Romberg sign and ataxic gait further support a diagnosis of subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, which is caused by vitamin B12 deficiency. In untreated HIV patients, malabsorption and nutritional deficiencies are common, which can lead to vitamin B12 deficiency. Elevated levels of methylmalonic acid (MMA) are indicative of vitamin B12 deficiency, as MMA accumulates when B12 is deficient. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is elevated levels of MMA due to vitamin B12 deficiency.",9
2435,"The patient presents with signs of a surgical site infection, including erythema, dusky patches, cloudy discharge, and decreased sensation around the wound. These findings are concerning for necrotizing fasciitis, a severe soft tissue infection that requires urgent surgical intervention. The presence of systemic signs such as fever, hypotension, and tachycardia further supports this diagnosis. While broad-spectrum antibiotics are necessary, they are not sufficient alone to treat necrotizing fasciitis. Surgical debridement is critical to remove necrotic tissue and control the infection. Therefore, the best next step in management is to initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics and perform surgical debridement.",9
2447,"The patient's clinical picture is consistent with Wilson's disease, a genetic disorder characterized by defective copper metabolism leading to copper accumulation in tissues. Key features include low serum copper, high urine copper, and low serum ceruloplasmin. Penicillamine is used to chelate copper in Wilson's disease. 

- **A. Kinky, easily breakable hair**: This is associated with Menkes disease, a disorder of copper transport leading to copper deficiency, not Wilson's disease.
- **B. Cirrhosis**: Copper accumulation in the liver can lead to cirrhosis, which is consistent with Wilson's disease.
- **C. Hemiballismus**: Neurological symptoms, including movement disorders, can occur in Wilson's disease due to basal ganglia involvement.
- **D. Corneal deposits**: Kayser-Fleischer rings, corneal copper deposits, are a classic finding in Wilson's disease.

Therefore, the least consistent feature with Wilson's disease is kinky, easily breakable hair, which is more indicative of Menkes disease.",9
2446,"The patient is a 40-year-old male with Down syndrome who is experiencing cognitive decline and behavioral changes. In individuals with Down syndrome, there is an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease at an earlier age due to the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21, which carries the gene for amyloid precursor protein (APP). This leads to abnormal protein metabolism, specifically the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques, which is characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. The symptoms described, such as difficulty managing daily routines, wandering, and changes in behavior, are consistent with early-onset Alzheimer's disease, which is common in individuals with Down syndrome. TSH is normal, ruling out hypothyroidism as a cause. Therefore, the most likely cause of his symptoms is related to abnormal protein metabolism.",9
2448,"The patient's symptoms and MRI findings are key to determining the diagnosis. The recurrent headaches, irritability, and seizure suggest a space-occupying lesion in the brain. The spastic paresis and Babinski sign on the right side indicate an upper motor neuron lesion affecting the left side of the brain, likely in the frontal lobe. 

Meningiomas are extra-axial tumors that often present with seizures and can cause focal neurological deficits depending on their location. They are more common in older adults and can cause symptoms by compressing adjacent brain structures.

Pituitary adenomas typically present with hormonal imbalances or visual disturbances due to compression of the optic chiasm, not with seizures or focal neurological deficits.

Ependymomas are more common in children and typically occur in the ventricles, causing hydrocephalus rather than focal neurological deficits.

Oligodendrogliomas can present with seizures and are often located in the frontal lobe, but they are less common than meningiomas and typically present in younger adults.

Given the patient's age, symptoms, and likely MRI findings, a meningioma is the most probable diagnosis.",9
2452,"Alcohol is effective at disrupting lipid membranes, which means it is effective against enveloped viruses. Enveloped viruses, such as herpesvirus and coronavirus, have lipid membranes that can be disrupted by alcohol, leading to their inactivation. Non-enveloped viruses, such as adenovirus and rhinovirus, lack this lipid membrane and are more resistant to alcohol-based disinfection. Therefore, after cleaning with alcohol, non-enveloped viruses like adenovirus and rhinovirus are more likely to survive.",9
2455,"The patient has rheumatoid arthritis and presents with symptoms of anemia, including fatigue and dyspnea. Her laboratory findings show normocytic anemia (MCV of 84 μm3) with a high serum ferritin level (375 ng/mL), which is indicative of anemia of chronic disease (ACD). In ACD, inflammation leads to increased production of hepcidin by the liver. Hepcidin decreases iron absorption from the gut and traps iron in macrophages, reducing its availability for erythropoiesis. This results in anemia despite normal or increased iron stores, as reflected by the high ferritin level. Therefore, the increased release of hepcidin by hepatocytes is the most likely contributor to her symptoms.",9
2463,"The patient is a 16-year-old with type 1 diabetes mellitus who is well-controlled, as indicated by his hemoglobin A1C of 6.3%. He is interested in joining the high school soccer team, which involves increased physical activity. In type 1 diabetes, exercise can increase insulin sensitivity and lead to hypoglycemia. Therefore, it is often recommended to adjust insulin dosage on days of increased physical activity to prevent hypoglycemia. Lowering the insulin dosage on days of exercise is a common strategy to manage this risk. Advising against physical activity is not appropriate as exercise is beneficial for overall health. Switching to metformin is not suitable as it is not a treatment for type 1 diabetes. Increasing insulin dosage on days of exercise would increase the risk of hypoglycemia.",9
2464,"The patient has a history of invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast and now presents with a 4-cm hyperintense mass in the temporal region of the brain. This is highly suggestive of a metastatic brain lesion, given her cancer history. In cases of solitary brain metastasis, especially when the lesion is accessible and the patient is in good health, surgical resection is often the preferred initial treatment. This approach can provide symptomatic relief, allow for histological confirmation, and potentially improve survival. Whole brain radiation therapy is typically considered when there are multiple metastases or after surgical resection. Chemotherapy is not usually the first-line treatment for brain metastases due to the blood-brain barrier. Antibiotic therapy is not indicated as there is no evidence of infection.",9
2465,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a neurological condition rather than a musculoskeletal one. The shock-like pain in the leg, clumsiness in the dark, and positive Romberg test indicate sensory ataxia, which is often due to dorsal column dysfunction. The miotic pupil that constricts with accommodation but not with light is known as Argyll Robertson pupil, which is associated with neurosyphilis. The history of a painless genital lesion 15 years ago is consistent with primary syphilis, which can progress to neurosyphilis if untreated. The combination of these findings points towards a sexually transmitted infection, specifically syphilis, as the cause of the symptoms.",9
2474,"The patient presents with multiple contrast-enhancing lesions in the brain, lungs, and liver, along with elevated human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels. This clinical picture is suggestive of metastatic choriocarcinoma, a type of non-seminomatous germ cell tumor. Choriocarcinoma is characterized by the presence of syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast cells, which are responsible for the production of hCG. The normal α-fetoprotein level helps rule out other germ cell tumors like yolk sac tumors, which would typically elevate α-fetoprotein levels. Therefore, the microscopic feature that best describes the lesions is the intimate association of syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast cells.",9
2443,,0
2490,"Cervical cancer, particularly in-situ cervical cancer, typically arises from the transformation zone of the cervix. This area is where the columnar epithelium of the endocervix meets the squamous epithelium of the ectocervix. The most common type of cervical cancer is squamous cell carcinoma, which arises from the non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium of the ectocervix. Therefore, the in-situ cervical cancer in this patient is most likely derived from non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium.",9
2492,"The 8-month-old girl presents with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis, including fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and signs of dehydration. The history of multiple infections since starting daycare and the incomplete immunizations suggest a possible viral etiology, such as rotavirus, which is common in this age group and setting. The presence of hypokalemia is likely due to the diarrhea. Given the acute presentation and the need to identify the cause of the diarrhea, an enzyme immunoassay of the stool is appropriate to test for rotavirus or other pathogens. Sonography of the abdomen is not indicated for acute diarrhea without signs of obstruction or other abdominal pathology. Antidiarrheal medications are generally not recommended in young children due to the risk of complications. Blood cultures are not routinely indicated unless there is suspicion of bacteremia, which is not strongly suggested here. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to perform an enzyme immunoassay of the stool to identify the infectious agent.",9
2482,"The patient's lab results show a low bicarbonate level (8 mEq/L), a low pH (7.25), and a low PaCO2 (20 mmHg), indicating a primary metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation. The elevated chloride level suggests a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, which is typically associated with a normal anion gap. The most common cause of normal anion gap metabolic acidosis is diarrhea, which leads to loss of bicarbonate. The patient's recent history of gastroenteritis supports this, as diarrhea can result in significant bicarbonate loss. Altitude sickness would cause a respiratory alkalosis, ethanol consumption could cause an anion gap metabolic acidosis, and vomiting typically causes metabolic alkalosis due to loss of gastric acid.",9
2495,"The purified protein derivative (PPD) test is used to screen for tuberculosis (TB) infection. The reaction observed in this test is a classic example of a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction, also known as a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. This type of reaction is mediated by T cells, specifically CD4+ T helper 1 (Th1) cells, which release cytokines that activate macrophages. The induration and erythema observed at the site of injection are due to the infiltration of these immune cells. This reaction typically occurs 48-72 hours after exposure to the antigen, which aligns with the 36-hour timeframe in this scenario. Type I hypersensitivity involves IgE and immediate allergic reactions, Type II involves antibody-mediated cytotoxicity, and Type III involves immune complex deposition, none of which apply to the PPD test.",9
2497,"The patient is experiencing secondary amenorrhea and difficulty conceiving, likely due to hypothalamic amenorrhea. This condition is often caused by stress, low body weight, and excessive exercise, leading to low levels of gonadotropins (FSH and LH) and subsequently low estrogen levels, as indicated by her symptoms of vaginal dryness and amenorrhea. Her hormone levels show low FSH and LH, consistent with hypothalamic dysfunction. Pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) therapy is used to stimulate the pituitary to release FSH and LH in a physiological manner, which can help restore ovulation in cases of hypothalamic amenorrhea. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management, after addressing lifestyle factors, is to offer pulsatile GnRH therapy.",9
2500,"The scenario describes a situation where patients who underwent routine imaging were found to have a longer average survival compared to those diagnosed based on symptoms. This suggests that the imaging might have detected the recurrence earlier. However, this does not necessarily mean that the imaging improved the overall survival outcome. The earlier detection of disease recurrence due to routine imaging could simply mean that the disease was identified sooner, without actually prolonging the patient's life. This is a classic example of lead-time bias, where early detection is mistaken for increased survival time, even though the actual course of the disease is unchanged.",9
2507,"The patient's symptoms are suggestive of peptic ulcer disease, particularly given the epigastric pain that occurs after eating. Risk factors include smoking and alcohol consumption. Peptic ulcers can lead to complications such as gastrointestinal hemorrhage, perforation, and obstruction. Among the options provided, gastrointestinal hemorrhage is a common complication of peptic ulcers due to erosion into a blood vessel. Malignant transformation is not typically associated with peptic ulcers. Biliary tract infection and subhepatic abscess formation are not directly related to the symptoms and risk factors presented in this case.",9
2511,"The patient has several hundred pigmented lesions, which suggests a condition like dysplastic nevus syndrome or familial atypical multiple mole melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome. This condition is associated with an increased risk of melanoma. Melanoma is characterized histologically by S100-positive epithelioid cells with fine granules. 

- Option A describes squamous cell carcinoma, which is not associated with pigmented lesions.
- Option B describes melanoma, which fits the clinical picture.
- Option C describes signet ring cells, typically seen in gastric carcinoma.
- Option D describes basal cell carcinoma, which is not associated with pigmented lesions like those described.

Therefore, the correct answer is B.",9
2504,"The patient is a trauma victim with cervical spine tenderness after a motor vehicle accident. She is stable, alert, and oriented with a GCS of 15, indicating no immediate airway compromise or need for intubation. The presence of cervical spine tenderness necessitates further evaluation to rule out cervical spine injury. Removing the cervical collar without imaging could risk exacerbating a potential injury. Discharging the patient without imaging would be inappropriate given the mechanism of injury and cervical tenderness. Therefore, the next best step is to perform a CT scan of the cervical spine to assess for any fractures or injuries.",9
2513,"To find the end-systolic volume (ESV), we need to use the formula for cardiac output (CO): \( CO = SV \times HR \), where SV is the stroke volume and HR is the heart rate. We also know that \( SV = EDV - ESV \), where EDV is the end-diastolic volume.

Given:
- CO = 6 L/min = 6000 mL/min
- HR = 100/min
- Ejection fraction (EF) = 60%

First, calculate the stroke volume (SV):
\[ SV = \frac{CO}{HR} = \frac{6000 \, \text{mL/min}}{100 \, \text{beats/min}} = 60 \, \text{mL/beat} \]

Next, use the ejection fraction to find the end-diastolic volume (EDV):
\[ EF = \frac{SV}{EDV} \]
\[ 0.60 = \frac{60}{EDV} \]
\[ EDV = \frac{60}{0.60} = 100 \, \text{mL} \]

Now, solve for the end-systolic volume (ESV):
\[ SV = EDV - ESV \]
\[ 60 = 100 - ESV \]
\[ ESV = 100 - 60 = 40 \, \text{mL} \]

Therefore, the end-systolic volume is 40 mL.",10
2516,"The patient has been diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, as indicated by the presence of multinucleated and bilobed cells (Reed-Sternberg cells) in the lymph node biopsy. The standard chemotherapy regimen for Hodgkin's lymphoma is ABVD, which includes Adriamycin (doxorubicin), Bleomycin, Vinblastine, and Dacarbazine.

The patient developed cardiomyopathy after chemotherapy, as evidenced by the enlargement of all heart chambers and severe exertion dyspnea. Adriamycin (doxorubicin) is well-known for causing cardiotoxicity, particularly dilated cardiomyopathy, which can lead to heart failure. This is consistent with the echocardiographic findings and the patient's symptoms after chemotherapy.

Vinblastine and Dacarbazine are not typically associated with cardiotoxicity. Rituximab is not part of the ABVD regimen and is used for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, not Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Therefore, the drug most likely responsible for the cardiotoxic side effects is Adriamycin (doxorubicin).",10
2522,"The patient is a heavy smoker and is using combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs). Smoking, especially in women over the age of 35 who use OCPs, significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). This risk is due to the pro-thrombotic effects of both smoking and estrogen in the OCPs. Although the patient is only 28 years old, the physician is likely considering the cumulative risk factors of smoking and OCP use, which can still increase the risk of thromboembolic events. The other options related to CYP enzyme interactions are not the primary concern in this scenario.",9
2530,"The patient's symptoms include confusion, difficulty finding words, memory issues, getting lost, incontinence, and a shuffling gait. These symptoms are characteristic of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), which is classically described by the triad of dementia, gait disturbance, and urinary incontinence. The family history of early onset dementia might suggest a genetic component, but the specific symptoms align more closely with NPH. The most effective treatment for NPH is the placement of a shunt to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid, which can alleviate the symptoms.",9

2531,"Unfractionated heparin is an anticoagulant used to treat and prevent thromboembolic disorders. It works by activating antithrombin III, which in turn inhibits thrombin and factor Xa. The anticoagulant effect of unfractionated heparin is monitored using the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). This test measures the time it takes for blood to clot and is used to adjust the heparin dose to ensure therapeutic anticoagulation while minimizing the risk of bleeding. Prothrombin time (PT) and INR are used to monitor warfarin therapy, not heparin. Creatinine level is important for dosing low molecular weight heparins, which are renally cleared, but not for unfractionated heparin.",9
2544,"The patient's symptoms and findings are suggestive of an inflammatory bowel disease. The key points in the vignette include intermittent lower abdominal cramps, diarrhea, weight loss, and a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, indicating inflammation. The barium enema shows ulceration and narrowing of the right colon, which is characteristic of Crohn disease. Crohn disease often affects the terminal ileum and right colon, leading to symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. The patient's Ashkenazi Jewish descent also increases the likelihood of Crohn disease, as it is more prevalent in this population. Ulcerative colitis typically affects the rectum and extends proximally in a continuous manner, which does not match the findings of right colon involvement. Celiac disease would not typically cause ulceration and narrowing of the colon, and an intestinal carcinoid tumor would not usually present with these findings. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Crohn disease.",9
2541,"The patient's symptoms and recent travel history are key to identifying the correct diagnosis. He presents with fever, malaise, headaches, joint pain, a pruritic rash, and blood in his ejaculate. He also has partial hearing impairment and conjunctival suffusion. The travel history to Brazil and exposure to mosquitoes are significant. 

- **Chagas disease (A)** is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, transmitted by the triatomine bug, not mosquitoes, and typically presents with different symptoms such as cardiomyopathy or megacolon.

- **Malaria (B)** is transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes and typically presents with fever, chills, and anemia. The blood smear would likely show Plasmodium parasites, which are absent here.

- **Rocky Mountain spotted fever (C)** is caused by Rickettsia rickettsii, transmitted by ticks, and usually presents with a rash that involves the palms and soles, which is not the case here.

- **Zika virus disease (D)** is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and is known to cause fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis. The presence of blood in the ejaculate and hearing impairment can also be associated with Zika virus infection. The travel history to Brazil, where Zika is endemic, and the lack of mosquito bite prevention further support this diagnosis.

Given the symptoms and travel history, Zika virus disease is the most likely diagnosis.",9
2546,"The patient presents with signs of a septic abortion, characterized by fever, chills, foul-smelling discharge, and hemodynamic instability (hypotension and tachycardia). The ultrasound confirms a non-viable intrauterine pregnancy. In cases of septic abortion, the priority is to stabilize the patient and treat the infection. This involves administering broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, such as clindamycin and gentamicin, to cover anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. After initiating antibiotic therapy, the next step is to evacuate the uterine contents to remove the source of infection, which is typically done via suction and curettage. Therefore, the most appropriate management is intravenous antibiotics followed by uterine evacuation.",9
2548,"The patient is experiencing a whistling sound during respiration, which is often indicative of a septal perforation. This can occur after nasal trauma, especially if there was a septal hematoma that was not properly managed. A septal hematoma can lead to cartilage necrosis and subsequent perforation if not drained. The history of nasal fracture and the subsequent whistling sound suggest that a septal hematoma may have developed and was not drained, leading to the perforation. Therefore, the appropriate intervention that could have prevented the whistling sound is the drainage of a nasal septal hematoma.",9
2549,"The patient is a 17-year-old boy presenting with behavioral changes, academic difficulties, paranoia, depression, anhedonia, disorganized speech, tangential thinking, flat affect, and auditory hallucinations. These symptoms suggest a psychotic disorder. Schizophrenia requires symptoms to be present for at least 6 months, while schizophreniform disorder is diagnosed when symptoms last more than 1 month but less than 6 months. Schizoaffective disorder involves mood disorder symptoms concurrent with schizophrenia symptoms, but the mood symptoms are not prominent here. Schizotypal personality disorder involves odd beliefs and behaviors but not full-blown psychosis. Given the 4-month duration of symptoms, the most appropriate diagnosis is schizophreniform disorder.",9
2556,"The patient is a 6-year-old male with a history of easy bruising and a family history suggestive of a hereditary bleeding disorder. The laboratory findings show an isolated prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) with normal prothrombin time (PT) and bleeding time (BT). This pattern is characteristic of a deficiency in the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade, specifically involving factors VIII, IX, XI, or XII. The normal bleeding time suggests that platelet function is intact, ruling out platelet disorders such as von Willebrand disease (which would also prolong BT) or Glanzmann thrombasthenia. The family history of similar problems in a maternal uncle suggests an X-linked recessive pattern, which is typical for hemophilia A (Factor VIII deficiency) or hemophilia B (Factor IX deficiency). Given the options, Factor VIII deficiency (hemophilia A) is the most likely cause of the prolonged PTT and the clinical presentation of easy bruising without mucosal bleeding.",9
2557,"The patient's symptoms and occupational exposure suggest a chronic granulomatous disease, likely hypersensitivity pneumonitis due to his work at a flour mill. The chest x-ray findings of reticulonodular infiltrates and the lung biopsy likely showing granulomas point towards a granulomatous process. In granulomatous inflammation, particularly in diseases like sarcoidosis or hypersensitivity pneumonitis, the cytokines interferon gamma and interleukin-2 are crucial. Interferon gamma is produced by Th1 cells and is essential for macrophage activation, while interleukin-2 is important for T-cell proliferation. These cytokines are involved in the formation and maintenance of granulomas.",9
2559,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of acute rheumatic fever, which can occur after a streptococcal throat infection. The presence of subcutaneous nodules, fever, and a new heart murmur are consistent with this diagnosis. In acute rheumatic fever, the characteristic histological finding in the myocardium is Aschoff bodies, which are areas of fibrinoid necrosis surrounded by histiocytes (Anitschkow cells). Therefore, an endomysial biopsy in this context would show fibrinoid necrosis with histiocytic infiltrate.",9
2561,"The clinical presentation and cerebrospinal fluid findings are suggestive of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder. The key features include rapidly progressing dementia, myoclonus (involuntary muscle jerking), and the presence of 14-3-3 protein in the CSF. The pathologic hallmark of CJD is spongiform changes in the brain tissue, characterized by vacuolation of the cortex and sometimes the deeper gray matter structures. This spongiform appearance is due to the accumulation of prion proteins, leading to neuronal loss and gliosis. The other options do not match the typical findings of CJD: marked atrophy of the caudate and putamen is associated with Huntington's disease, focal inflammatory demyelination with multiple sclerosis, and amyloid beta deposits with Alzheimer's disease.",9
2562,"The patient presents with symptoms of nocturia, urinary discomfort, and an enlarged prostate on examination, which could suggest benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). However, the elevated creatinine level indicates possible renal impairment. The presence of proteinuria (1+) without hematuria or RBC casts suggests a renal issue that is not primarily glomerular. Given the family history of renal cell carcinoma and the need to evaluate the cause of renal impairment, renal ultrasonography is appropriate to assess for structural abnormalities such as hydronephrosis, renal masses, or cysts that could explain the renal dysfunction. This non-invasive test can help rule out obstructive uropathy or other renal pathologies.",9
2563,"The patient presents with a painless scrotal swelling that is firm and nontender, and a light held behind the scrotum does not transilluminate. This suggests that the mass is solid rather than fluid-filled. A hydrocele would typically transilluminate because it is a fluid-filled sac. A scrotal hernia might reduce when the patient is supine, but this mass does not. Orchitis usually presents with pain and tenderness, which is not the case here. The characteristics of the mass being solid, firm, and nontender are most consistent with a testicular tumor.",9
2565,"The clinical presentation of this 10-year-old girl suggests possible appendicitis, given the right lower quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis. The family history of Crohn's disease is noted but does not directly influence the immediate diagnostic approach for acute abdominal pain. In pediatric patients, an abdominal ultrasound is often preferred as the initial imaging modality for suspected appendicitis due to its lack of radiation and good sensitivity and specificity in children. CT scans are more definitive but involve radiation exposure, which is a concern in pediatric patients. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform an ultrasound of the abdomen to evaluate for appendicitis.",9
2571,"The patient presents with left shoulder pain after a fall, but the shoulder examination shows full range of motion and no tenderness at the acromioclavicular joint, suggesting the shoulder itself is not injured. However, the abdominal exam reveals significant tenderness in the left upper quadrant with guarding, which raises concern for potential abdominal injury, such as splenic injury, especially given the mechanism of the fall. The presence of psoriasis and a history of shoulder injury are not directly relevant to the acute management of this case. Given the abdominal findings and the mechanism of injury, the most appropriate next step is to evaluate for possible internal injury, particularly to the spleen. Therefore, a CT scan of the abdomen is warranted to assess for any intra-abdominal injuries.",9
2573,"The patient is likely suffering from Alzheimer's disease, given her symptoms of memory loss, confusion, and difficulty with language, along with the CT findings of cortical atrophy. The medication described is likely memantine, which is an NMDA receptor antagonist. NMDA receptors are a type of glutamate receptor that, when activated, allow calcium ions to enter the cell. By inhibiting these receptors, memantine reduces the influx of calcium ions into neurons. This is beneficial in Alzheimer's disease because excessive calcium influx can lead to excitotoxicity and neuronal damage. Therefore, the downstream effect of this medication is decreased intracellular calcium.",9
2572,"The clinical presentation of this 3-year-old boy suggests a primary immunodeficiency. He has recurrent bacterial infections, including pneumonia and otitis media, and hypoplastic tonsils and adenoids, which are indicative of a lack of lymphoid tissue. These findings are consistent with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (Bruton's agammaglobulinemia), which is caused by a mutation in the BTK (Bruton's tyrosine kinase) gene. This condition leads to a failure of B-cell maturation, resulting in very low levels of immunoglobulins and absent or reduced lymphoid tissue. The recurrent bacterial infections are due to the lack of antibody production. The other options do not fit as well: 

- Defective NADPH oxidase (A) is associated with chronic granulomatous disease, which presents with recurrent catalase-positive infections and granuloma formation.
- Defective IL-2R gamma chain (B) is associated with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), which presents with severe infections early in life and a lack of both T and B cells.
- WAS gene mutation (C) is associated with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, which presents with eczema, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent infections.

Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is a tyrosine kinase gene mutation.",9
2575,"The patient presents with symptoms of lethargy, confusion, nausea, increased urination, and signs of dehydration (dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor). He also has a fever and crackles in the lung, suggesting a possible infection, such as pneumonia. However, the symptoms of increased urination and confusion could indicate hyperglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis, especially given the acute change in mental status. Checking blood glucose is a quick and essential step to rule out or confirm hyperglycemia, which could be contributing to his altered mental status. While a chest x-ray and antibiotics may be necessary to address a potential pneumonia, the immediate concern is to assess and manage any metabolic derangement that could be life-threatening, such as hyperglycemia.",9
2576,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with a history of cocaine use. Cocaine can cause coronary vasospasm and increase myocardial oxygen demand, leading to ischemia. The ECG changes and symptoms are consistent with myocardial ischemia. In the setting of cocaine use, beta-blockers like propranolol are contraindicated because they can lead to unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation, worsening vasospasm and potentially leading to severe hypertension or coronary vasoconstriction. Diazepam can be used to alleviate anxiety and reduce sympathetic outflow. Prasugrel is an antiplatelet agent, and diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker that can help relieve coronary vasospasm. Therefore, propranolol is contraindicated in this scenario.",9
2579,"The patient presents with symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia following a head injury, which suggests central diabetes insipidus (DI). Central DI is caused by a deficiency in the production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin. ADH is produced in the hypothalamus, specifically in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, and then transported to the posterior pituitary for release. The elevated serum sodium level (hypernatremia) and symptoms of dehydration (delayed capillary refill, decreased skin turgor) further support the diagnosis of DI. Given the head trauma and the symptoms, the most likely cause is a defect in the production of ADH in the supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus.",9
2578,"The patient is a 26-year-old pregnant woman at 12 weeks gestation with a blood type of A negative. In pregnancy, it is important to assess for Rh incompatibility, especially if the mother is Rh-negative. The indirect Coombs test is used to detect antibodies in the mother's blood that could potentially attack Rh-positive fetal red blood cells. This is particularly relevant for Rh-negative mothers to determine if they have developed antibodies from a previous pregnancy or transfusion. The other tests listed are not directly relevant to this scenario: the direct Coombs test is used to detect antibodies bound to red blood cells, the white blood cell differential is not indicated given the normal leukocyte count, and vitamin B12 measurement is not relevant to the current clinical situation. Therefore, the appropriate test is the indirect Coombs test.",9
2580,"The patient is presenting with symptoms suggestive of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including insomnia, hyperarousal, and intrusive memories related to his military service. The best initial medical therapy for PTSD typically involves selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Escitalopram, an SSRI, is commonly used for PTSD and is appropriate given the patient's symptoms. Bupropion is not typically used for PTSD, buspirone is used for anxiety but not specifically for PTSD, and clonazepam is a benzodiazepine that is not recommended as first-line treatment for PTSD due to potential for dependence and lack of efficacy in treating core PTSD symptoms.",9
2583,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with acute bacterial prostatitis. The most common cause of acute bacterial prostatitis in men is Escherichia coli, a gram-negative, lactose-fermenting rod. E. coli typically forms pink colonies on MacConkey agar due to lactose fermentation. The patient's high fever, urinary symptoms, and tender prostate support this diagnosis. The leukocytosis further indicates a bacterial infection. Other options, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (oxidase-positive, green colonies) or Klebsiella pneumoniae (mucoid colonies), are less common causes of prostatitis. Neisseria gonorrhoeae (intracellular diplococci) is not typically associated with prostatitis in this context.",9
2587,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), for which he was likely prescribed a medication to reduce stomach acid. The symptoms of decreased libido and enlarged breast tissue (gynecomastia) are side effects associated with cimetidine, a histamine H2-receptor antagonist. Cimetidine is known to have anti-androgenic effects, which can lead to gynecomastia and decreased libido. Other H2 blockers like famotidine and nizatidine, and proton pump inhibitors like lansoprazole, are less likely to cause these side effects.",9
2581,"The patient was treated for H. pylori infection with a combination of bismuth subsalicylate, omeprazole, metronidazole, and tetracycline. Despite this, the repeat urease breath test is positive, indicating persistent infection. The patient's continued abdominal pain and positive test suggest treatment failure. One potential reason for this failure is the interaction between antacids and antibiotics. Antacids can interfere with the absorption of certain antibiotics, particularly tetracycline, which is part of the treatment regimen. The patient is taking a large number of antacid tablets daily, which could reduce the effectiveness of tetracycline and lead to treatment failure. Other options like alcohol use, allopurinol, and ibuprofen are less likely to directly interfere with the eradication of H. pylori.",9
2593,"The patient presents with sudden difficulty breathing and chest pain, and the CT scan shows filling defects in the left pulmonary artery, indicating a pulmonary embolism (PE). She is on oral contraceptives, which are known to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism due to a hypercoagulable state. The absence of recent travel and leg pain makes venous stasis less likely. There is no indication of endothelial injury. Anxiety does not cause filling defects in the pulmonary artery. Therefore, the most likely mechanism for the pulmonary embolism in this patient is hypercoagulability due to oral contraceptive use.",9
2590,"The newborn is presenting with jaundice, which is common in the first week of life. The total bilirubin level is 8 mg/dL, with a direct (conjugated) bilirubin of 0.5 mg/dL, indicating that the majority of the bilirubin is unconjugated. This is consistent with physiological jaundice, which is common in newborns due to immature liver function and increased red blood cell turnover. The fact that the newborn is feeding well and has normal bowel and urination patterns, along with normal vital signs and no other abnormalities, supports this diagnosis. The bilirubin level is not excessively high, and there are no signs of kernicterus or other complications. Therefore, the most appropriate management at this stage is reassurance, as this condition typically resolves on its own.",9
2586,"The patient is experiencing infertility, and her husband's sperm count is adequate, suggesting the issue may be with her ovulation. The OBGYN prescribed a medication similar to GnRH to be administered in a pulsatile manner. Pulsatile administration of GnRH analogs is used to stimulate the pituitary gland to release FSH and LH, which can induce ovulation. Leuprolide is a GnRH analog that can be used in a pulsatile manner to stimulate ovulation. Anastrazole is an aromatase inhibitor, Clomiphene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator, and Mestranol is an estrogen. Therefore, the drug prescribed is Leuprolide.",9
2591,"The patient presents with symptoms and lab findings suggestive of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (evidenced by schistocytes and elevated LDH), thrombocytopenia, renal impairment, fever, and neurological symptoms (seizure and confusion). The normal PT and PTT, along with negative fibrin split products, help differentiate TTP from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The most appropriate and urgent treatment for TTP is plasma exchange therapy, which removes the inhibitory antibodies against ADAMTS13 and replenishes the enzyme, thereby reducing the formation of microthrombi.",9
2607,"The patient presented with an acute myocardial infarction (MI) and underwent successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Initially, there was decreased left ventricular function and local hypokinesia, which improved to normal ejection fraction and no hypokinesis after 14 days. This clinical course is characteristic of myocardial stunning, which is a temporary post-ischemic dysfunction of the myocardium that occurs despite the restoration of normal blood flow. It is reversible and does not involve permanent damage to the heart muscle, which aligns with the improvement seen in the echocardiography after 14 days.",9
2595,"The patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder, including decreased interest in activities, sadness, insomnia, fatigue, and decreased libido. She also has a history of smoking and expresses a desire to quit. When considering pharmacotherapy, it's important to address both her depressive symptoms and her smoking cessation goals. Bupropion is an antidepressant that is also used to aid smoking cessation. It is known to have a lower risk of sexual side effects compared to SSRIs like fluoxetine and SNRIs like venlafaxine. Trazodone is primarily used for its sedative effects and is not typically first-line for depression. Therefore, bupropion is the most appropriate choice as it can help with both depression and smoking cessation, and it is less likely to exacerbate her sexual dysfunction.",9
2599,"The patient's symptoms and biopsy findings are suggestive of celiac disease, which is characterized by an immune-mediated reaction to gluten leading to villous atrophy in the small intestine. This condition is often associated with selective IgA deficiency. IgA is the immunoglobulin that plays a crucial role in mucosal immunity, and its deficiency is the most common primary immunodeficiency associated with celiac disease. Patients with celiac disease and IgA deficiency may have atypical serological test results, which can complicate diagnosis.",9
2611,"The patient presents with difficulty swallowing, regurgitation of undigested food, and a fluctuant neck mass, along with foul-smelling breath. These symptoms are suggestive of a Zenker's diverticulum, which is a pharyngoesophageal diverticulum that can lead to the collection of food and subsequent regurgitation. The foul-smelling breath is due to food decomposition in the diverticulum. The pathogenesis of Zenker's diverticulum involves abnormal esophageal motor function, specifically dysfunction of the cricopharyngeal muscle leading to increased pressure and outpouching of the mucosa. This is consistent with the patient's symptoms and the presence of a neck mass.",9
2613,"The clinical presentation of the boy suggests Prader-Willi syndrome, which is characterized by short stature, obesity, hypotonia, developmental delays, and intellectual disability. The key features in this case include short stature, obesity, hypotonia, developmental delay, and hypopigmentation. Prader-Willi syndrome is caused by the loss of function of genes on the paternal chromosome 15 (15q11-q13). This can occur due to a deletion on the paternal chromosome, maternal uniparental disomy, or an imprinting defect. Therefore, the most likely cause of this condition is paternal inheritance.",9
2603,"The patient's presentation includes severely pruritic erythroderma with scaling, well-demarcated pink patches, and enlarged inguinal lymph nodes. The key finding from the skin biopsy is the presence of Pautrier microabscesses, which are collections of atypical lymphocytes in the epidermis. This histological feature is characteristic of mycosis fungoides, a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The other options do not typically present with Pautrier microabscesses: psoriasis presents with silvery scales and Auspitz sign, lichen planus with purple, polygonal papules, and atopic dermatitis with eczematous lesions and a history of atopy.",9
2612,"Amikacin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic. Resistance to aminoglycosides, including amikacin, is often due to the enzymatic modification of the drug. This modification can occur through acetylation, phosphorylation, or adenylation, which inactivates the drug and prevents it from binding to the bacterial ribosome. Among these mechanisms, acetylation is a common method of resistance. Therefore, the bacteria likely have an enhanced ability to transfer acetyl groups, which would modify and inactivate amikacin, leading to resistance.",9
2614,"The patient's symptoms and family history suggest Huntington's disease. The key features include mood changes, irritability, and chorea (irregular movements of the limbs and trunk). The family history of suicide at a relatively young age also supports this diagnosis, as Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant disorder with psychiatric manifestations and a family history of similar symptoms. The cognitive decline, as evidenced by her difficulty with word recall, further supports this diagnosis. In Huntington's disease, MRI of the brain typically shows atrophy of the caudate nucleus.",9
2617,"The patient has had a new ischemic stroke while on aspirin therapy. The current management involves secondary prevention of stroke. The options for secondary prevention include antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, and addressing risk factors. Since the patient is already on aspirin and has had a stroke, increasing the dose of aspirin is not typically recommended due to the increased risk of bleeding without significant additional benefit. Administering tPA is not appropriate as it is used for acute management within a 4.5-hour window, and the patient is outside this window. Warfarin is used for cardioembolic strokes, but the patient has normal sinus rhythm and no indication of atrial fibrillation or other cardioembolic sources. Adding dipyridamole to aspirin (as in the combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole) is a common strategy for secondary prevention of stroke, especially in patients who have had a stroke while on aspirin alone. Therefore, the next step in management is to add dipyridamole.",9
2619,"The scenario describes a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, which is a classic example of a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction. This type of reaction is mediated by T cells, specifically CD4+ Th1 cells. The indurated, hypopigmented patch observed four weeks after the injection is consistent with a delayed-type hypersensitivity response, such as that seen in a tuberculin skin test. In this type of immune response, CD4+ Th1 cells recognize antigens presented by macrophages and release cytokines like IFN-gamma, which activate macrophages and lead to the induration and inflammation observed at the site. This is not primarily mediated by antibodies, neutrophils, or TGF-beta, making increased activity of CD4+ Th1 cells the most likely explanation.",9
2623,"The patient has worsening asthma symptoms after moving to a moldy apartment, suggesting a possible allergic or hypersensitivity reaction. The intradermal injection of Candida albicans extract and the subsequent induration after 48 hours indicate a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction, which is a type IV hypersensitivity. This reaction is mediated by T cells, specifically CD4+ Th1 cells, which release cytokines such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ) to activate macrophages. The induration is due to the recruitment and activation of macrophages and other immune cells. Therefore, the substance responsible for this reaction is interferon-γ.",9
2624,"The patient is a 31-year-old woman at 35 weeks of gestation presenting with a severe headache, blurred vision, hypertension (160/110 mmHg), and proteinuria. These symptoms are classic for preeclampsia, a condition characterized by new-onset hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation. The pathophysiology of preeclampsia involves abnormal placentation, specifically the abnormal remodeling of the spiral arteries in the placenta, leading to placental ischemia and the release of factors that cause systemic endothelial dysfunction. This results in hypertension and proteinuria. The rash on her face is likely unrelated to the preeclampsia and attributed to a change in cosmetics. Therefore, the most likely explanation for her symptoms is abnormal placental spiral arteries.",9
2628,"The patient presents with nontender, irregular, hyperkeratotic sessile lesions in the perianal area that turn white upon application of acetic acid. These characteristics are consistent with condylomata acuminata, which are caused by the Human papilloma virus (HPV). The acetic acid test is commonly used to identify HPV-related lesions as they turn white upon application. The patient's inconsistent condom use and multiple sexual partners increase her risk for sexually transmitted infections, including HPV. Other options like Poxvirus (causes molluscum contagiosum), Treponema pallidum (causes syphilis), and benign fibroepithelial growths do not match the presentation and acetic acid test results.",9
2625,"The patient presents with signs of respiratory distress, hypotension, and paradoxical chest wall movement. The key finding here is the inward movement of the upper part of the left chest wall during inspiration, which is characteristic of a flail chest. Flail chest occurs when a segment of the rib cage breaks and becomes detached from the rest of the chest wall, leading to paradoxical movement. This is consistent with the patient's history of a high-speed motor vehicle collision and the presence of diffuse crepitus, indicating rib fractures. The absence of breath sounds on the left could be due to associated pulmonary contusion or pneumothorax, but the primary cause of the paradoxical movement is the flail chest. Other options like phrenic nerve paralysis, cardiac tamponade, and sternal fracture do not explain the paradoxical chest movement.",9
2639,"The patient presents with diffuse vesicles and tense blisters on the chest, arms, and shoulders, with no oral involvement and a negative Nikolsky sign (rubbing the skin does not produce blisters). These clinical features are suggestive of bullous pemphigoid, an autoimmune blistering disorder. Bullous pemphigoid is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against hemidesmosomes in the basement membrane zone of the skin. Direct immunofluorescence studies of a skin biopsy in bullous pemphigoid typically show linear deposits of IgG and C3 along the basement membrane. This finding distinguishes it from other blistering disorders such as pemphigus vulgaris, which shows intercellular IgG deposits, and dermatitis herpetiformis, which is associated with antibodies to tissue transglutaminase and granular IgA deposits. The absence of oral lesions and the tense nature of the blisters further support the diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid.",9
2637,"The patient's symptoms of heat intolerance, rapid heart rate, and unintentional weight loss, along with the physical exam findings of tachycardia and warm skin, suggest hyperthyroidism. The radioactive iodine uptake scan shows several focal nodules of increased uptake, which is indicative of toxic multinodular goiter. In hyperthyroidism, the thyroid gland produces excess thyroid hormones (T4 and T3), leading to suppression of TSH due to negative feedback. Therefore, the serum analysis is expected to show low TSH and high T4 levels.",9
2640,"The patient is undergoing chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia and presents with symptoms consistent with tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), which can cause hyperkalemia. The ECG findings of peaked T waves and widened QRS complexes indicate significant hyperkalemia, which can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. In the setting of hyperkalemia with ECG changes, the immediate treatment is to stabilize the cardiac membrane potential. Calcium chloride is used to stabilize the cardiac membrane and prevent arrhythmias. While insulin can help lower potassium levels, calcium chloride is the immediate treatment to address the ECG changes.",9
2641,"The child in the scenario has features consistent with Down syndrome, which is characterized by trisomy 21. Children with Down syndrome have a higher risk of developing certain medical conditions, including hematological disorders like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). As they age, individuals with Down syndrome are also at an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease due to the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21, which contains the gene for amyloid precursor protein (APP). This genetic predisposition leads to early-onset Alzheimer's disease in many individuals with Down syndrome.",9
2648,"Lipidator is a nonionic surfactant that disrupts lipid membranes. Enveloped viruses have lipid membranes, while non-enveloped viruses do not. Herpesvirus, Hepadnavirus, and Flavivirus are all enveloped viruses, meaning they have lipid membranes that can be disrupted by Lipidator. Picornavirus, on the other hand, is a non-enveloped virus, meaning it lacks a lipid membrane and would not be disrupted by Lipidator.",9
2650,"The patient's symptoms are suggestive of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), characterized by an uncomfortable sensation in the legs that is relieved by movement, often leading to insomnia. The fact that her husband observes her flexing her ankles during sleep further supports this diagnosis. RLS is often treated with dopaminergic agents. Ropinirole, a dopamine agonist, is commonly used to manage RLS symptoms. Zolpidem is a sedative used for insomnia but does not address the underlying RLS. Atenolol is a beta-blocker, and Sertraline is an SSRI, neither of which are appropriate for RLS.",9
2663,"Gardos channel blockers work by inhibiting the Gardos channel, which is a calcium-activated potassium channel in red blood cells. When these channels are blocked, potassium efflux is reduced, which in turn prevents the loss of water from the cells, thereby preventing dehydration of red blood cells. This mechanism helps in reducing sickling of red blood cells in patients with sickle cell disease.",9
2656,"The patient's symptoms and the presence of kidney bean-shaped diplococci within neutrophils on Gram stain suggest an infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae. This organism is known for causing urethritis and is characterized by its ability to evade the immune system, leading to recurrent infections. The key factor in its immune evasion is the antigenic variation of its pili. The pili are hair-like structures on the surface of the bacteria that facilitate attachment to host cells. Neisseria gonorrhoeae can frequently change the structure of its pili through genetic recombination, allowing it to evade the host's immune response and cause repeated infections. This antigenic variation is why the patient lacks immunity against the organism despite previous infections.",9
2652,"The patient's symptoms include abdominal pain, severe vomiting, a seizure, hypokalemia (low potassium), and ventricular tachycardia. These findings are consistent with theophylline toxicity. Theophylline is a methylxanthine used in the treatment of COPD and asthma, and overdose can lead to gastrointestinal disturbances, seizures, hypokalemia, and cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia. Albuterol, a beta-agonist, can cause hypokalemia and tachycardia but is less likely to cause seizures and severe vomiting. Metoprolol, a beta-blocker, would not cause hypokalemia or seizures. Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, can cause seizures and arrhythmias but typically leads to hyperkalemia rather than hypokalemia.",9
2666,"The patient is a 53-year-old man presenting with behavioral changes, irritability, forgetfulness, and language difficulties over the past 8 months. His symptoms include inappropriate behavior, such as accusing a customer of using black magic, which suggests personality changes. He also has difficulty with word finding and naming objects, indicating language impairment. These symptoms are characteristic of frontotemporal dementia, specifically the behavioral variant, also known as Pick’s disease. 

Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease typically presents with rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus, and other neurological signs, which are not present here. Huntington’s disease usually involves movement disorders and a family history, neither of which are noted. Lewy body dementia often includes visual hallucinations and parkinsonism, which are absent in this case.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Pick’s disease.",9
2670,"The key points in this scenario are the child's recurrent hypoglycemia, the low C-peptide level, and the presence of the mother during hospitalization. A low C-peptide level in the context of hypoglycemia suggests exogenous insulin administration, as endogenous insulin production would typically result in a normal or high C-peptide level. Given that the child is experiencing these episodes while under the mother's care, and considering the normalization of glucose levels when not under her direct supervision, this points towards Munchausen syndrome by proxy. This condition involves a caregiver, often a parent, inducing or fabricating illness in a child to gain attention or sympathy. The other options do not fit as well: Munchausen syndrome involves self-inflicted illness, somatic symptom disorder involves excessive concern about symptoms without fabrication, and conversion disorder involves neurological symptoms without a medical cause.",9
2677,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a condition affecting the cervical spinal cord. The key symptoms include neck pain, weakness and numbness in the hands, difficulty gripping objects, and loss of pain and temperature sensation in the hands. These symptoms are characteristic of syringomyelia, which is a condition where a cyst or syrinx forms within the spinal cord, often in the cervical region. This syrinx can damage the crossing fibers of the spinothalamic tract, leading to a ""cape-like"" distribution of sensory loss (loss of pain and temperature sensation) while sparing the dorsal columns (preserved proprioception and vibration sense). The motor symptoms (weakness and exaggerated reflexes) suggest involvement of the corticospinal tract. Given these findings, the most likely additional finding would be a cavitation in the cervical spinal cord, consistent with syringomyelia.",9
2680,"The patient's symptoms and clinical findings suggest a diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). The key features include skin tightness, fingertip ulcers, and pulmonary involvement (fine inspiratory crackles suggesting interstitial lung disease). The burning chest pain and lack of response to proton pump inhibitors could be due to esophageal involvement, which is common in scleroderma. The most specific antibody associated with systemic sclerosis, particularly the diffuse form, is anti-topoisomerase I (also known as anti-Scl-70) antibodies. This matches the clinical presentation of skin involvement and potential lung fibrosis.",9
2675,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN), which typically occurs after a streptococcal infection, such as bacterial tonsillitis. The key features include periorbital swelling, dark urine (indicative of hematuria), hypertension, and laboratory findings of proteinuria, hematuria, and RBC casts. The renal biopsy findings characteristic of PSGN include granular deposits of IgG, IgM, and C3 on immunofluorescence, due to immune complex deposition in the glomeruli. This is consistent with the history of a recent streptococcal infection and the current symptoms.",9
2674,"The patient's symptoms of episodic sweating, heart racing, pallor, and pounding headaches, along with severe hypertension, are suggestive of a pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas are tumors that arise from chromaffin cells, which are responsible for producing catecholamines (e.g., adrenaline and noradrenaline). These tumors can cause paroxysmal episodes of hypertension and other adrenergic symptoms due to excessive catecholamine release. The most common location for these tumors is within the adrenal medulla, where chromaffin cells are located. Therefore, the neoplasm in this patient is most likely arising from adrenal chromaffin cells.",9
2683,"The electrocardiogram shows ST elevations in the inferior leads (II, III, and aVF) and in leads V5 and V6. ST elevations in the inferior leads suggest an inferior wall myocardial infarction, typically involving the right coronary artery (RCA) or the left circumflex artery (LCX). However, the ST elevations in leads V5 and V6 are indicative of lateral wall involvement. The lateral wall of the left ventricle is supplied by the left circumflex coronary artery. Therefore, the ST elevations in V5 and V6 are most indicative of pathology in the lateral wall of the left ventricle, which is supplied by the left circumflex coronary artery.",9
2621,,0
2686,"The clinical presentation of the 8-year-old girl includes abdominal pain, a nonpruritic rash on the legs, joint swelling, and a history of a recent sore throat. The rash is described as non-blanching, raised erythematous papules, which is characteristic of palpable purpura. The positive stool occult blood test suggests gastrointestinal involvement, likely due to vasculitis. The platelet count is normal, ruling out thrombocytopenic conditions like immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The recent sore throat and the combination of symptoms are suggestive of Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), a type of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. HSP is characterized by palpable purpura, arthralgia or arthritis, abdominal pain, and renal involvement, often following an upper respiratory infection. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is leukocytoclastic vasculitis, specifically Henoch-Schönlein purpura.",9
2687,"The situation involves a physician who is showing signs of impairment, including missed appointments, intra-operative errors, and the smell of alcohol. These behaviors suggest that the colleague may be struggling with substance use or other issues affecting his ability to practice safely. The primary concern is patient safety, and the physician has a duty to address this issue appropriately. Confronting the colleague in private (Option A) may not be sufficient to ensure patient safety and may not lead to the necessary intervention. Informing the colleague's patients (Option C) is not appropriate as it breaches confidentiality and does not address the root issue. Alerting the State Licensing Board (Option D) is a more severe step that might be necessary if other interventions fail, but it is not the first step. Informing the local Physician Health Program (Option B) is the most appropriate action as these programs are designed to confidentially assess and assist physicians with issues that may impair their ability to practice safely, providing support and resources to help the colleague while protecting patients.",9
2707,"The patient's symptoms and MRI findings suggest progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a demyelinating disease caused by the JC virus, which is a double-stranded, circular DNA virus. PML is associated with immunosuppression, often seen in patients receiving certain types of chemotherapy or immunotherapy. The key clue here is the patient's chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and the recent chemotherapy. Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody against CD20, is commonly used in CLL treatment and is known to increase the risk of PML due to its immunosuppressive effects. The other options do not typically cause immunosuppression leading to PML.",9
2698,"The patient initially presented with symptoms suggestive of giant cell arteritis (GCA), such as headaches, jaw claudication, and visual disturbances, which were confirmed by a temporal artery biopsy showing arteritis. The appropriate treatment for GCA is high-dose corticosteroids. After five months of treatment, the patient now presents with proximal muscle weakness, which is a common side effect of long-term corticosteroid use, leading to steroid-induced myopathy. This is characterized by weakness in the proximal muscles, such as those of the hips and shoulders, without significant pain or elevated creatine kinase levels, which matches the patient's current presentation. The normal ESR and creatine kinase levels further support this diagnosis, as inflammatory myopathies like polymyositis would typically show elevated creatine kinase levels. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is drug-induced myopathy due to corticosteroid use.",9
2708,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI) and possibly a kidney stone, given the radiopaque structure seen on imaging. The urinalysis shows an alkaline pH of 8.9, which is unusually high. This high pH is characteristic of infections with urease-producing bacteria, which can hydrolyze urea to ammonia, leading to alkaline urine. Proteus mirabilis is a common urease-producing bacterium that can cause UTIs and is known to increase urine pH. The presence of a radiopaque structure could indicate a struvite stone, which is associated with infections by urease-producing organisms like Proteus mirabilis. The other options, such as Escherichia coli, typically do not produce urease and are associated with acidic urine. Therefore, the most likely pathogen responsible for this patient's condition is Proteus mirabilis.",9
2716,"In the Amazon River basin, malaria is primarily caused by Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. Chloroquine resistance is widespread in these areas, making chloroquine an ineffective choice for prophylaxis. Mefloquine, atovaquone-proguanil, and doxycycline are commonly used for prophylaxis in areas with chloroquine-resistant malaria. Quinine is not used for prophylaxis; it is used for treatment of malaria. Therefore, the agent that should be avoided for prophylaxis in this patient is chloroquine due to resistance issues.",9
2719,"The patient is presenting with signs of portal hypertension and variceal bleeding, likely due to liver cirrhosis from alcohol use disorder. The drug given to decrease portal venous pressure is likely octreotide, a synthetic analog of somatostatin. Somatostatin inhibits the secretion of several hormones, including splanchnic vasodilatory hormones, glucagon, and insulin. Somatostatin is normally produced by D cells in the pancreas and gastrointestinal tract.",9
2710,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs consistent with heart failure, including difficulty breathing, bilateral rales, pitting edema, and a laterally displaced PMI. These findings suggest fluid overload, which is common in heart failure. The question states that she is given a medication that reduces volume status by competitively binding to aldosterone receptors. This description fits spironolactone, which is a potassium-sparing diuretic that acts as an aldosterone antagonist. It is commonly used in heart failure to reduce fluid overload and improve outcomes by blocking the effects of aldosterone, which promotes sodium and water retention. Amiloride is also a potassium-sparing diuretic but does not work by blocking aldosterone receptors. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that does not act on aldosterone receptors. Atorvastatin is a statin used for cholesterol management and does not affect volume status.",9
2727,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in individuals with advanced HIV/AIDS. The positive India ink stain and low CD4+ count support this diagnosis. The standard initial treatment for cryptococcal meningitis involves the use of amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine to rapidly reduce the fungal burden. Fluconazole is used for maintenance therapy after the initial induction phase. Acyclovir is used for viral infections like herpes simplex encephalitis, and dexamethasone is used in bacterial meningitis to reduce inflammation. Therefore, the next best step in therapy is to administer amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine.",9
2725,"The patient has a low BMI and a history of calorie restriction, which suggests she may be at risk for refeeding syndrome. Refeeding syndrome occurs when a malnourished individual is reintroduced to nutrition, leading to shifts in electrolytes and fluids. The most concerning electrolyte abnormality in refeeding syndrome is hypophosphatemia. When carbohydrates are reintroduced, insulin secretion increases, driving phosphate into cells and causing serum phosphate levels to drop. This can lead to serious complications such as muscle weakness, respiratory failure, and cardiac dysfunction. Therefore, hypophosphatemia is the most concerning electrolyte abnormality in this context.",9
2730,"The patient's presentation of sudden, bilateral, painful loss of vision, peripheral neuropathy, and urinary incontinence, along with normal MRI findings, suggests a possible diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). MS can present with optic neuritis, which causes painful vision loss, and other neurological symptoms. The normal MRI does not rule out MS, as lesions may not always be visible initially. A lumbar puncture showing oligoclonal bands would support the diagnosis of MS. Therefore, the best next step in management is a lumbar puncture to check for oligoclonal bands, which are indicative of MS.",9
2732,"In this scenario, the boy was bitten by a dog that he knows and has interacted with before. The dog is currently behaving normally, and there is no indication that it is rabid. The standard protocol for a dog bite from a known and healthy dog is to observe the dog for 10 days to monitor for any signs of rabies. If the dog remains healthy during this period, rabies post-exposure prophylaxis is not necessary. Immediate administration of rabies immune globulin or vaccine is typically reserved for high-risk situations, such as bites from wild animals or when the animal cannot be observed. Euthanizing the dog is not appropriate given the current information. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to observe the dog for 10 days.",9
2737,"The patient is a 16-year-old male with delayed puberty, as evidenced by the lack of testicular enlargement and absence of pubic and axillary hair. He also has a history of cleft palate and anosmia (lack of body odor detection), which are suggestive of Kallmann syndrome. Kallmann syndrome is a form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to a deficiency in GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) production. This leads to decreased levels of FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone), resulting in low testosterone levels. Therefore, the expected hormone profile would be decreased testosterone, decreased FSH, decreased LH, and decreased GnRH.",9
2726,"The patient is at 22 weeks gestation with a history of preterm labor and spontaneous abortion, and the ultrasound shows a short cervix measuring 20 mm. A short cervix in the mid-trimester is a risk factor for preterm birth. The most appropriate management for a short cervix in a woman with no prior preterm birth is vaginal progesterone. However, given her history of preterm labor, a cervical cerclage is indicated to prevent preterm birth in this high-risk patient.",9
2735,"The patient experiences syncope episodes that occur upon standing, which suggests orthostatic hypotension. Her blood pressure drops significantly from supine to standing (114/72 mm Hg to 95/60 mm Hg), indicating a postural change in blood pressure. This is consistent with autonomic dysfunction, which can cause inadequate vasoconstriction upon standing, leading to a drop in blood pressure and subsequent syncope. Her medications, particularly nortriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, can contribute to orthostatic hypotension due to its anticholinergic effects. Other potential causes like adrenal insufficiency, structural cardiac abnormality, and cardiac arrhythmia are less likely given the normal lab results, unremarkable cardiac monitoring, and the nature of her symptoms.",9
2738,"The patient is a 26-year-old woman at 10 weeks' gestation with an ultrasound showing a gestational sac and an embryo with absent cardiac activity. The mean diameter of the gestational sac is 23 mm, and the embryo is 6 mm in length. According to guidelines, the absence of cardiac activity in an embryo measuring 7 mm or more is diagnostic of a missed abortion. However, in this case, the embryo is 6 mm, which is close to the threshold. Despite this, the absence of cardiac activity at this stage is highly suggestive of a non-viable pregnancy. The most appropriate management for a missed abortion is to induce uterine evacuation. Misoprostol is a medication used to medically manage a missed abortion by inducing uterine contractions to expel the non-viable pregnancy tissue. Cervical cerclage is used for cervical insufficiency, thrombophilia work-up is not indicated in this scenario, and methotrexate is used for ectopic pregnancies, not missed abortions. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is misoprostol therapy.",9
2739,"The patient presents with signs of liver disease, including jaundice, ascites, and a history of alcohol use and hepatitis C. The laboratory findings show hyponatremia, elevated BUN and creatinine, and low urine sodium, which are indicative of prerenal azotemia. The low urine sodium suggests that the kidneys are responding to decreased effective circulating volume, which is consistent with hepatorenal syndrome. This condition occurs in the setting of advanced liver disease and is characterized by renal vasoconstriction leading to decreased renal perfusion and oliguria. The presence of ascites and jaundice supports the diagnosis of liver failure, which is causing the renal findings.",9
2762,"The patient experienced a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, as indicated by the description of violent jerky movements and postictal confusion. The normal vital signs, absence of focal neurological findings, and normal laboratory results suggest that this was an isolated seizure. The negative urine toxicology and normal MRI further support this. In cases of a first seizure, it is important to determine if there is an underlying epileptic disorder. Electroencephalography (EEG) is the most appropriate next step to evaluate for any epileptiform activity that might indicate epilepsy. Lorazepam is used for acute seizure management, which is not needed here as the seizure has resolved. A tilt table test is used for syncope evaluation, which is not relevant in this case. Lamotrigine is an antiepileptic drug, but starting medication is not indicated until further evaluation is done.",9
2746,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). She has bilateral joint pain and stiffness, particularly in the morning, affecting the proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints, as well as the presence of rheumatoid nodules. The X-ray findings of joint space narrowing and bony erosions further support this diagnosis. RA is associated with systemic inflammation, which can lead to complications such as anemia (as indicated by her low hematocrit) and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Patients with RA are at increased risk for osteoporosis due to chronic inflammation, use of glucocorticoids, and decreased physical activity. Sacroiliac joint inflammation is more characteristic of ankylosing spondylitis. Obstructive pulmonary disease is not directly related to RA, although interstitial lung disease can occur. Osteitis deformans, also known as Paget's disease of bone, is unrelated to RA. Therefore, the patient is at greatest risk for osteoporosis.",9
2770,"The patient's laboratory findings show an elevated bone-specific alkaline phosphatase concentration, which is typically associated with increased osteoblast activity. Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme produced by osteoblasts, and its elevation suggests increased bone formation. The normal urine deoxypyridinoline concentration indicates that there is no increased bone resorption, which would be expected if osteoclast activity were increased. The calcium and phosphorus levels are within normal limits, which does not suggest any significant parathyroid dysfunction or changes in chondroblast activity. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the elevated bone-specific alkaline phosphatase is increased osteoblast activity.",9
2769,"The patient presents with amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and negative pregnancy tests. These symptoms suggest hyperprolactinemia, which can be caused by a prolactinoma or other pituitary disorders. The best initial step is to check for causes of hyperprolactinemia. Thyroid dysfunction, particularly hypothyroidism, can lead to elevated prolactin levels. Therefore, checking the serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is an appropriate initial step to rule out hypothyroidism as a cause of her symptoms.",9
2771,"The patient's symptoms of deep dyspareunia and pelvic pain that worsens before menstruation are suggestive of endometriosis. Oral contraceptives are often used to manage endometriosis-related pain, but they have not been effective in this case. The beta hCG level is low, indicating that pregnancy is unlikely. The transabdominal ultrasound shows no abnormalities, which is common in endometriosis as it often requires direct visualization for diagnosis. 

A CT scan (option A) is not typically used to diagnose endometriosis as it may not show the lesions. CA-125 (option B) is a marker that can be elevated in endometriosis but is not specific and not diagnostic. Dilation and curettage (option D) is used for uterine issues, not for diagnosing endometriosis. 

Laparoscopy (option C) is the gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis as it allows direct visualization and potential biopsy of endometrial implants. Therefore, laparoscopy is the most likely procedure to establish a diagnosis in this case.",9
2773,"The patient is experiencing symptoms that align with major depressive disorder (MDD). She has persistent sadness, fatigue, insomnia (early morning awakening), significant weight loss, loss of interest in activities (anhedonia), and suicidal ideation. These symptoms have been present for at least 3 months, which exceeds the typical duration of acute grief. Acute grief usually involves sadness and longing for the deceased but does not typically include suicidal ideation or such significant functional impairment. Persistent depressive disorder requires symptoms for at least 2 years, and bipolar II disorder involves hypomanic episodes, which are not described here. Therefore, the most fitting diagnosis is major depressive disorder.",9
2778,"The study involves reviewing electronic medical records of patients to determine the prevalence of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and alcohol consumption on the day of presentation. The researchers then correlate these two variables to assess the relationship between alcohol consumption and ACS. This approach involves looking at data from a single point in time to assess both the exposure (alcohol consumption) and the outcome (ACS). This is characteristic of a cross-sectional study, where both exposure and outcome are measured simultaneously to determine prevalence and associations.",9
2780,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with bulimia nervosa, including binge eating, compensatory vomiting, normal BMI, calluses on the knuckles (Russell's sign), parotid gland enlargement, and dental enamel erosion. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for bulimia nervosa is an SSRI, specifically fluoxetine, which is the only FDA-approved medication for this condition. Other options like orlistat, mirtazapine, and venlafaxine are not indicated for bulimia nervosa.",9
2787,"The patient is a young woman with a regular menstrual cycle and a right adnexal mass found on examination. The ultrasound findings describe a 2-cm hypoechoic mass with a thin, smooth wall and posterior wall enhancement, which is characteristic of a simple ovarian cyst. Simple cysts are common and often benign, especially in premenopausal women. Given the size (2 cm) and the benign appearance on ultrasound (no septae, no solid components, no blood flow), the most appropriate management is observation. Simple cysts of this size in premenopausal women typically resolve spontaneously. Therefore, the best next step is a follow-up examination to monitor the cyst.",9
2789,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible infection with Actinomyces, given the productive cough with blood-tinged sputum containing yellow granules (sulfur granules), history of gingivitis, and smoking. The chest x-ray findings of a solitary nodule and cavitary lesion in the right upper lung field are consistent with pulmonary actinomycosis. Actinomyces is a gram-positive anaerobic bacterium that can cause chronic pulmonary infections, often following oral or dental infections. The most appropriate treatment for actinomycosis is Penicillin G.",9
2799,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest Paget's disease of bone. The key features include bone pain, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and characteristic x-ray findings such as cortical thickening and prominent trabecular markings. The hearing loss may be due to involvement of the skull bones. Paget's disease is characterized by an increased rate of bone remodeling, where there is excessive osteoclastic bone resorption followed by increased osteoblastic activity, leading to disorganized bone structure. This explains the elevated alkaline phosphatase and the x-ray findings. The normal calcium and phosphate levels, along with the elevated alkaline phosphatase, further support this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism is an increased rate of bone remodeling.",9
2797,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest Job's syndrome (Hyper-IgE syndrome), characterized by recurrent infections, eczema, high IgE levels, and eosinophilia. The deficiency of T helper 17 (Th17) cells is significant because Th17 cells are crucial for recruiting neutrophils to sites of infection. The impaired chemotaxis of neutrophils due to the lack of Th17 cells leads to increased susceptibility to infections, particularly with Staphylococcus aureus and other skin pathogens. This aligns with the patient's history of recurrent abscesses and pneumonia.",9
2803,"The patient presents with secondary amenorrhea and infertility, with a significantly elevated serum prolactin level. Her thyroid function is normal, as indicated by the TSH level. The elevated prolactin level suggests hyperprolactinemia, which can cause anovulation and infertility. The most common cause of hyperprolactinemia is a prolactinoma, a benign pituitary tumor. The best treatment for hyperprolactinemia due to a prolactinoma is a dopamine agonist, such as cabergoline, which reduces prolactin levels and can restore ovulation and fertility.",9
2807,"The patient has tested positive on both the HIV immunoassay and the HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation immunoassay, indicating an HIV infection. However, a diagnosis of AIDS is not made solely based on these tests. AIDS is diagnosed when an HIV-positive individual has a CD4 count below 200 cells/mm³ or has certain opportunistic infections or AIDS-defining conditions. Therefore, additional bloodwork, specifically a CD4 count, is needed to determine if she has progressed to AIDS.",9
2806,"The patient presents with fever, neck pain radiating to the jaw and ears, and swelling in the front part of the throat, which are classic symptoms of subacute thyroiditis (also known as de Quervain's thyroiditis). The tender, firm, and enlarged thyroid gland supports this diagnosis. The laboratory findings show low TSH and elevated T3 and T4, indicating hyperthyroidism. The elevated ESR suggests an inflammatory process. The 123I scan shows decreased uptake, which is typical for subacute thyroiditis as the thyroid is releasing preformed thyroid hormones rather than producing new ones. Thyroid lymphoma and struma ovarii would not typically present with these symptoms and scan findings. Factitious hyperthyroidism would not cause a tender thyroid gland or elevated ESR.",9
2812,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with cat scratch disease, caused by Bartonella henselae. This is suggested by the history of a kitten scratch, the presence of papules at the scratch site, and regional lymphadenopathy (enlarged and tender lymph nodes in the right axilla). The condition is usually self-limiting, especially in immunocompetent individuals, and often does not require antibiotic treatment. However, in cases where symptoms are severe or prolonged, or in immunocompromised patients, azithromycin is the antibiotic of choice. Given that the patient is otherwise healthy and the condition is typically self-limiting, the most appropriate management is to provide no pharmacotherapy at this time.",9
2813,"The study reports a relative risk (RR) of 2.30 with a p-value of 0.04, indicating statistical significance at the 0.05 level. For the RR to be statistically significant, the 95% confidence interval should not include 1.0. Among the options, only option A (1.01-3.70) does not include 1.0, making it consistent with the given p-value and the reported RR.",9
2814,"The patient presents with symptoms that are characteristic of Korsakoff syndrome, a chronic neurocognitive disorder often associated with thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, commonly seen in chronic alcoholics. The key features include memory impairment, particularly anterograde amnesia (inability to form new memories), confabulation, and sometimes retrograde amnesia. The patient exhibits severe ataxia, horizontal nystagmus, and disorientation, which are consistent with this condition. The fact that he remembers distant past events but forgets recent interactions suggests anterograde amnesia. Delirium and delirium tremens are acute conditions with fluctuating consciousness and autonomic instability, which are not described here. Dementia is a more gradual decline in cognitive function, not typically associated with the acute presentation seen here.",9
2822,"The patient is a 17-year-old girl who avoids social interactions due to fear of rejection. This behavior is consistent with avoidant personality disorder, which is characterized by feelings of inadequacy, hypersensitivity to negative evaluation, and social inhibition. The key feature here is the avoidance of social situations due to fear of rejection, which aligns with avoidant personality disorder. Schizoid personality disorder involves a lack of desire for social relationships and a preference for solitary activities, which does not match the patient's fear of rejection. Social phobia (social anxiety disorder) involves intense fear of social situations, but the context here suggests a broader pattern of avoidance and feelings of inadequacy. Body dysmorphic disorder involves preoccupation with perceived physical defects, which is not indicated in this scenario.",9
2821,"To determine the statistical significance of the hazard ratios (HRs) in the studies, we need to look at the confidence intervals (CIs). A CI that does not include 1 indicates statistical significance. 

- Study A: HR = 1.7, 95% CI = 0.89–2.9. The CI includes 1, indicating that the result is not statistically significant.
- Study B: HR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.1–2.5. The CI does not include 1, indicating that the result is statistically significant.

The p-value is related to statistical significance. A larger p-value corresponds to a lack of statistical significance, while a smaller p-value indicates statistical significance. Since study A's CI includes 1, it is not statistically significant, and its p-value is likely larger than that of study B, which is statistically significant.

Therefore, the statement that the p-value of study A is likely larger than the p-value of study B is accurate.",9
2824,"The patient is exhibiting symptoms of tardive dyskinesia, which is characterized by repetitive, involuntary movements such as lip-smacking and tongue movements. Tardive dyskinesia is a known side effect of long-term use of typical antipsychotics, particularly those with strong dopamine D2 receptor antagonism. Haloperidol, a typical antipsychotic, is well-known for causing tardive dyskinesia. Atypical antipsychotics like clozapine, olanzapine, and risperidone are less likely to cause tardive dyskinesia, although risperidone can still cause it to some extent. However, given the classic presentation of tardive dyskinesia and the history of schizophrenia treatment, haloperidol is the most likely medication responsible for these symptoms.",9
2825,"The patient is being treated for breast cancer with a medication that inhibits thymidylate synthetase. This description matches the mechanism of action of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of various cancers, including breast cancer. One of the known adverse effects of 5-FU is photosensitivity, which is a skin reaction that occurs upon exposure to sunlight. The other options listed are associated with different medications: peripheral neuropathy is commonly associated with drugs like vincristine or cisplatin, pulmonary fibrosis with drugs like bleomycin, and dilated cardiomyopathy with doxorubicin. Therefore, the correct answer is photosensitivity.",9
2830,"The clinical scenario describes a case of a skin abscess, which is characterized by the presence of pus. Pus is primarily composed of neutrophils, which are the first responders to bacterial infections and are recruited to the site of infection to phagocytize bacteria and cellular debris. The cytokine IL-8 is a key chemokine involved in the recruitment and activation of neutrophils to sites of infection and inflammation. Therefore, the cytokine involved in the recruitment of the primary cell type (neutrophils) found in the pus is IL-8.",10
2829,"The question involves evaluating a solitary pulmonary nodule for potential malignancy. The features of the nodule on imaging can help differentiate between benign and malignant causes. Calcification patterns are particularly important in this differentiation. 

- **Lack of calcification (A)**: This is often associated with a higher risk of malignancy. Malignant nodules are less likely to have calcifications, and if they do, the pattern is usually not benign.

- **Dense central nidus of calcification (B)**: This pattern is typically seen in benign lesions, such as granulomas.

- **Multiple punctate foci of calcification throughout the nodule (C)**: This pattern can be seen in some malignant lesions, but it is more commonly associated with benign conditions.

- **Popcorn ball calcification (D)**: This is characteristic of a hamartoma, which is a benign lesion.

Given these options, the lack of calcification is most associated with an increased possibility of malignancy.",9
2827,"The patient presents with sudden onset of anterograde amnesia, where she cannot form new memories, as evidenced by her inability to recall how she got to the emergency department and her repeated questioning. She is alert and oriented to self and place but not to time, and she has no recall of objects after 5 minutes. Her neurological exam is otherwise normal, and there is no history of head trauma. These symptoms are characteristic of transient global amnesia (TGA), which is a sudden, temporary episode of memory loss that cannot be attributed to a more common neurological condition such as epilepsy or stroke. TGA is often associated with stress or physical exertion and typically resolves within 24 hours. The other options are less likely given the presentation: depersonalization/derealization disorder involves feelings of detachment, seizures would likely have other neurological signs or postictal confusion, and migraines would typically present with headache and possibly aura, not isolated memory loss.",9
2801,"The patient presents with symptoms and imaging findings suggestive of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome), which is characterized by massive colonic dilation without mechanical obstruction. This is common in hospitalized patients, particularly after surgery, and can be exacerbated by medications such as chlorpromazine, which has anticholinergic effects. The patient is febrile, tachycardic, and has peritoneal signs (guarding and rebound tenderness), which are concerning for impending perforation, especially given the significant cecal dilation to 14 cm. While nasogastric and rectal tube decompression can be initial measures, the presence of significant dilation and peritoneal signs requires more urgent intervention. Neostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, is effective in decompression of the colon in Ogilvie's syndrome, but given the peritoneal signs and the risk of perforation, surgical intervention is necessary. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is a laparotomy to address potential colonic ischemia or perforation.",9
2836,"The patient is presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with primary syphilis, as indicated by the clean, ulcerated genital lesion and positive serologic tests (RPR and FTA-abs). She is pregnant and has a documented allergy to amoxicillin, which suggests a potential allergy to penicillin. However, penicillin is the only recommended treatment for syphilis during pregnancy to prevent congenital syphilis. Therefore, the best course of action is to desensitize the patient to penicillin and then administer the appropriate treatment. Options B and C involve tetracycline and doxycycline, which are contraindicated in pregnancy. Option D is not appropriate as delaying treatment could lead to complications for both the mother and the fetus.",9
2835,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest that the child has chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). This condition is characterized by a defect in the NADPH oxidase complex, leading to impaired production of reactive oxygen species in phagocytes. The dihydrorhodamine (DHR) test is used to assess the oxidative burst in neutrophils, and a failure to fluoresce indicates a defect in this pathway, consistent with CGD. Patients with CGD are particularly susceptible to infections with catalase-positive organisms because these organisms can neutralize the small amounts of hydrogen peroxide that might otherwise be used by the host's immune system to kill them. Serratia marcescens is a catalase-positive organism and is one of the classic pathogens associated with CGD. Therefore, this patient is at greatest risk of infection with Serratia marcescens.",10
2834,"The patient presents with iron deficiency anemia, as indicated by low hemoglobin, low mean corpuscular volume, low ferritin, low serum iron, and high total iron-binding capacity. Additionally, the presence of a monoclonal protein on serum electrophoresis (12 g/L, non-IgM) and clonal bone marrow plasma cells comprising 4% of the total number of cells are significant findings.

To differentiate between the options:

- **Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)** is characterized by the presence of a monoclonal protein in the serum, less than 10% clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow, and no end-organ damage (such as hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, or bone lesions). This fits the patient's profile as he has 4% clonal plasma cells and no end-organ damage.

- **Smoldering multiple myeloma** requires a higher percentage of clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow (10% or more) and/or a higher level of monoclonal protein, but without end-organ damage. The patient does not meet these criteria.

- **Symptomatic multiple myeloma** involves clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow (usually >10%) and evidence of end-organ damage (CRAB criteria: hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, bone lesions). The patient does not have these features.

- **Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia** is characterized by the presence of IgM monoclonal protein, which is not the case here (non-IgM monoclonal protein).

Given the findings, the most appropriate diagnosis to consider is MGUS.",9
2840,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with viral conjunctivitis, likely caused by adenovirus. This is suggested by the abrupt onset of symptoms, watery discharge, follicular conjunctivitis, and preauricular lymphadenopathy. Viral conjunctivitis is typically self-limiting and does not require specific antiviral treatment. Acyclovir ointment is used for herpetic infections, levofloxacin drops are for bacterial infections, and tetracycline ointment is also for bacterial infections. Therefore, no medical treatment is required for viral conjunctivitis.",9
2847,"The patient presents with sudden onset right-sided weakness, suggesting a possible stroke. The diffuse and severe pain throughout the body, which he has experienced before, raises suspicion for sickle cell disease, especially given his immigrant status from South America where sickle cell disease can be prevalent. In sickle cell disease, vaso-occlusive crises can lead to stroke. The CT scan shows no bleeding, ruling out hemorrhagic stroke. In the context of sickle cell disease, exchange transfusion is used to reduce the proportion of sickled cells and improve oxygen delivery, which is crucial in managing acute stroke in these patients. Therefore, the best management in this scenario is exchange transfusion.",9
2845,"The clinical presentation of this 4-year-old boy suggests a muscular dystrophy, specifically Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Key features include delayed walking, frequent falls, calf pseudohypertrophy, and the Gowers' sign (using hands to push off the floor to stand). These are characteristic of DMD, which is caused by a mutation leading to the absence of the dystrophin protein. Dystrophin is crucial for muscle fiber stability, and its absence leads to muscle degeneration and weakness. The other options do not match the clinical presentation: 

- Loss of the ATM protein is associated with ataxia-telangiectasia, which involves neurological and immunological symptoms.
- Myotonin protein kinase defect is related to myotonic dystrophy, which presents with myotonia and other systemic features.
- Arylsulfatase A deficiency causes metachromatic leukodystrophy, a lysosomal storage disorder with neurological decline.

Thus, the absence of dystrophin protein is the most likely underlying mechanism.",9
2850,"To calculate the relative risk (RR), we need to compare the risk of the outcome (contracting the virus) in the exposed group to the risk in the unexposed group. 

1. Calculate the risk in the exposed group:
   - Number of positive cases in the exposed group = 500
   - Total number of exposed individuals = 1000
   - Risk in exposed group = 500 / 1000 = 0.5

2. Calculate the risk in the unexposed group:
   - Number of positive cases in the unexposed group = 5
   - Total number of unexposed individuals = 1000
   - Risk in unexposed group = 5 / 1000 = 0.005

3. Calculate the relative risk:
   - RR = Risk in exposed group / Risk in unexposed group = 0.5 / 0.005 = 100

Now, let's match this calculation to the options provided:

Option C: [500 / (500 + 500)] / [5 / (5 + 995)] = 0.5 / 0.005 = 100

Therefore, the correct answer is C.",9
2851,"The patient presents with recurrent jaundice and laboratory findings indicating conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (elevated direct bilirubin). The presence of bilirubin in the urine and normal urobilinogen suggests that the liver is conjugating bilirubin, but there is an issue with excretion. The normal alkaline phosphatase and liver enzymes (AST and ALT) suggest that there is no significant liver damage or obstruction. The serology indicates past hepatitis A infection (anti-HAV IgG positive) and immunity to hepatitis B (anti-HBsAg positive, HBsAg negative), ruling out active viral hepatitis. The recurrent nature of the jaundice and the laboratory findings are consistent with a condition like Dubin-Johnson syndrome, which is characterized by impaired hepatic excretion of conjugated bilirubin due to a defect in the canalicular transport of bilirubin. This is a genetic condition where the liver cells cannot properly excrete conjugated bilirubin into the bile, leading to its buildup in the blood.",9
2852,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of Parkinson's disease, such as bradykinesia, tremor, and muscle rigidity. The tremor that diminishes with action is characteristic of Parkinson's disease. The physician prescribes a medication that is also used to treat prolactinomas. In the treatment of prolactinomas, dopamine agonists like bromocriptine or cabergoline are used because they activate dopamine receptors, which in turn inhibit prolactin secretion. Therefore, the medication prescribed is likely a dopamine agonist, which is used in Parkinson's disease to compensate for the decreased dopamine levels. Thus, the mechanism of action of the medication is to activate dopamine receptors.",9
2857,"The clinical presentation and autopsy findings suggest that the patient had lobar pneumonia, likely caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, given the gram-positive cocci in the sputum. The autopsy finding of a pale, grayish-brown, firm lung is characteristic of the 'gray hepatization' stage of lobar pneumonia. During this stage, the lung tissue is consolidated and appears gray due to the breakdown of red blood cells and the presence of fibrinopurulent exudate. Microscopically, this stage is characterized by fibrinopurulent exudate with lysed erythrocytes, as the red blood cells have been broken down and replaced by fibrin and leukocytes.",9
2853,"The clinical presentation of the patient, including failure to thrive, developmental delay, coarse facial features, gingival hyperplasia, and hepatomegaly, along with the laboratory findings of increased lysosomal enzyme concentration in the serum and decreased N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase activity, is indicative of I-cell disease (mucolipidosis II). This condition is caused by a defect in the enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase, which is responsible for phosphorylating mannose residues on lysosomal enzymes. This phosphorylation is necessary for the enzymes to be targeted to the lysosomes. Without this mannose-6-phosphate marker, the enzymes are secreted outside the cell instead of being directed to the lysosomes, leading to the accumulation of undegraded substrates within the lysosomes and the symptoms observed. Therefore, the correct mechanism is that lysosomal enzymes are secreted from the cells instead of being targeted to lysosomes because of lack of mannose phosphorylation on N-linked glycoproteins.",9
2855,"The patient presents with microcytic anemia (low MCV) and low reticulocyte count, indicating a hypoproliferative anemia. The high iron and ferritin levels, along with low total iron-binding capacity, suggest that iron deficiency is unlikely. Chronic inflammation could cause anemia of chronic disease, but the iron studies are not typical for this condition, which usually shows low iron and normal to high ferritin. Beta thalassemia minor would typically show normal to high iron levels, but the red cell distribution width is usually normal, and the reticulocyte count might be higher. The patient was diagnosed with latent tuberculosis and likely started on isoniazid, which can cause sideroblastic anemia, characterized by microcytic anemia with high iron and ferritin levels. This aligns with the adverse effect of medication.",9
2859,"The patient's symptoms and history are suggestive of a tick-borne illness. The key details include a maculopapular rash on the palms and soles, fever, headache, and a recent camping trip in North Carolina. These symptoms are characteristic of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), which is caused by Rickettsia rickettsii. RMSF is transmitted by the Dermacentor tick, which is prevalent in the southeastern United States, including North Carolina. The rash involving the palms and soles, along with the systemic symptoms, aligns with this diagnosis. Other options, such as a sexually transmitted spirochete (syphilis), do not fit the acute presentation and recent camping trip history. Lyme disease, transmitted by the Ixodes tick, typically presents with an erythema migrans rash and is more common in the northeastern U.S. The RNA virus option does not fit the clinical picture of a tick-borne illness with a rash on palms and soles.",9
2861,"Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a cytokine produced by antigen-presenting cells in response to pathogens, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide. IL-12 plays a crucial role in the differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into Th1 cells. Th1 cells are primarily involved in cell-mediated immune responses, which are essential for fighting intracellular pathogens, such as viruses and some bacteria. They do this by activating macrophages and promoting the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), which enhances the ability of macrophages to kill ingested microbes. Therefore, when a CD4+ T cell is exposed to IL-12, it will differentiate into a Th1 cell and promote cell-mediated immune responses.",9
2872,"The presence of DNA fragments at multiples of 180 base pairs is characteristic of DNA laddering, which is a hallmark of apoptosis. During apoptosis, caspases are activated, leading to the cleavage of cellular components, including the activation of endonucleases that cleave DNA at internucleosomal regions. This results in DNA fragments that are multiples of approximately 180 base pairs, corresponding to the length of DNA wrapped around a nucleosome. Therefore, the pathophysiology of this finding is due to caspase activation, which is a key process in the apoptotic pathway.",9
2868,"The clinical presentation of the patient is suggestive of Turner syndrome. Key features include short stature, webbed neck, low-set ears, and increased carrying angle (cubitus valgus). The blood pressure discrepancy between the arms and legs, along with rib notching on chest x-ray, suggests coarctation of the aorta, which is associated with Turner syndrome. Turner syndrome is characterized by the presence of streak ovaries due to gonadal dysgenesis. Other options such as horseshoe adrenal gland, prolonged aPTT, and mutation of FBN1 are not associated with Turner syndrome. Horseshoe kidney, not adrenal gland, is sometimes seen in Turner syndrome, but the question asks for the most likely finding, which is streak ovaries.",9
2865,"The histologic description of the adnexal mass suggests a granulosa cell tumor, which is a type of sex cord-stromal tumor. These tumors are known to secrete estrogen, which can lead to symptoms such as breast tenderness and menstrual irregularities due to increased estrogen levels. The small cuboidal cells arranged in clusters with eosinophilic secretions are characteristic of Call-Exner bodies, which are seen in granulosa cell tumors. Therefore, the laboratory value most likely increased in this patient is estradiol, reflecting the estrogen secretion by the tumor.",9
2873,"The newborn has a ventricular septal defect (VSD), which causes left-to-right shunting of blood. This results in increased blood flow to the right ventricle and pulmonary circulation, leading to increased left atrial pressure due to increased pulmonary venous return. The left ventricular pressure is typically normal or slightly increased due to increased preload. The right ventricular pressure is elevated due to the increased volume load from the shunt.

After surgical repair of the VSD, the left-to-right shunt is eliminated. This results in decreased blood flow to the right ventricle and pulmonary circulation, leading to a decrease in left atrial pressure as the pulmonary venous return normalizes. The left ventricular pressure may increase slightly due to the normalization of preload and afterload conditions. The right ventricular pressure decreases because the volume overload is resolved.

Therefore, the expected changes after successful repair are:
- Left atrial pressure: Decreases
- Left ventricular pressure: Increases
- Right ventricular pressure: Decreases

This corresponds to option B.",9
2879,"The newborn presents with central cyanosis, a holosystolic murmur, and a single second heart sound, along with an enlarged cardiac silhouette and narrowed mediastinum on chest X-ray. These findings are suggestive of a congenital heart defect, specifically transposition of the great arteries (TGA). In TGA, the aorta and pulmonary artery are switched, leading to parallel circulation and severe cyanosis. The single second heart sound is due to the anterior position of the aorta, and the holosystolic murmur could be due to an associated ventricular septal defect (VSD), which is common in TGA. The narrowed mediastinum is described as an 'egg on a string' appearance, typical of TGA. The defect associated with this condition is a ventricular septal defect, which allows some mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, providing some relief from cyanosis.",9
2875,"The boy's symptoms of intermittent shortness of breath and a dry cough, especially worse at night, suggest asthma. The spirometry results show normal forced vital capacity and peak expiratory flow rate initially, which is typical in asthma when the patient is not experiencing an acute exacerbation. The key part of the question is that after administering a drug, the peak expiratory flow rate is reduced. 

A. Atenolol is a beta-blocker, which can potentially cause bronchoconstriction, especially in asthmatic patients, but it is not typically used in diagnostic testing for asthma.

B. Methacholine is a muscarinic receptor agonist used in the methacholine challenge test to diagnose asthma. It causes bronchoconstriction, leading to a reduced peak expiratory flow rate in asthmatic patients.

C. Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic bronchodilator, which would not cause a reduction in peak expiratory flow rate.

D. Methoxyflurane is an inhalational anesthetic and is not relevant to this context.

The drug most likely administered to cause a reduction in peak expiratory flow rate in this scenario is methacholine, as it is used to provoke bronchoconstriction in asthma diagnosis.",9
2882,"The patient presents with signs of acute pyelonephritis and obstructive uropathy due to a large kidney stone at the ureteropelvic junction. The presence of fever, chills, flank pain, and costovertebral angle tenderness, along with leukocytosis and elevated creatinine, indicates a severe infection with possible sepsis. The urine pH is alkaline, which may suggest a urease-producing organism like Proteus mirabilis. The CT scan shows a 16-mm stone causing obstruction and signs of inflammation. In this scenario, immediate relief of the obstruction is critical to prevent further deterioration and allow for effective antibiotic treatment. Percutaneous nephrostomy is the most appropriate next step as it provides rapid decompression of the obstructed and infected collecting system, which is crucial in managing obstructive pyelonephritis with sepsis.",9
2887,"During the first prenatal visit, certain routine tests are recommended to ensure the health of the mother and the developing fetus. These tests typically include screening for infectious diseases that can affect pregnancy outcomes. 

- **HIV screening**: Even if the patient tested negative 4 years ago, current guidelines recommend re-testing during pregnancy to prevent mother-to-child transmission.
- **Syphilis screening**: The rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test is commonly used for syphilis screening in pregnancy.
- **Hepatitis B screening**: Checking for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is important to identify and manage hepatitis B infection, which can be transmitted to the newborn.

Option D includes ELISA for HIV, rapid plasma reagin test for syphilis, and serum HBsAg for hepatitis B, which are all standard tests recommended during the first prenatal visit.",9
2895,"The patient's symptoms and signs are consistent with viral conjunctivitis, likely caused by adenovirus, given the bilateral eye redness, watery discharge, sore throat, and preauricular lymphadenopathy. Viral conjunctivitis is typically self-limiting and does not require antibiotic treatment. Supportive care, such as warm compresses, is the most appropriate management to alleviate symptoms.",9
2891,"The patient presents with altered mental status, dry mucous membranes, and skin tenting, which are indicative of dehydration. His laboratory findings show elevated BUN and creatinine, suggesting acute kidney injury. The BUN/creatinine ratio is approximately 28.6 (40/1.4), which is consistent with prerenal azotemia, often due to dehydration. The urine sodium is within normal range, which does not suggest intrinsic renal damage or obstruction. There is no indication of infection or NSAID use in the history. The patient's history of being alone for several days without adequate fluid intake supports dehydration as the cause of his acute renal failure.",9
2897,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of toxic shock syndrome (TSS), which is associated with the use of tampons. The symptoms include high fever, hypotension, rash, and confusion. TSS is caused by the release of toxins, specifically toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), produced by Staphylococcus aureus. TSST-1 acts as a superantigen, leading to polyclonal T cell activation and massive cytokine release, which explains the systemic symptoms observed in this patient.",9
2898,"The patient presents with signs of spinal cord injury, including loss of sensation and motor function below the level of injury, which is indicated by the absence of pinprick sensation below the umbilicus and lack of rectal tone. The CT scan shows displacement of the lumbar vertebrae, suggesting a traumatic spinal cord injury. In the acute setting of spinal cord injury, the administration of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone within 8 hours of injury has been shown to potentially improve neurological outcomes by reducing inflammation and secondary injury to the spinal cord. Other options such as PET scan, radiation therapy, and antibiotics are not appropriate for the acute management of spinal cord injury.",9
2902,"The patient presents with concerns about having a serious illness (colon cancer) despite having no significant findings on physical examination or laboratory tests. Her symptoms of bloating and fatigue, along with her anxiety about having a serious illness, are consistent with a preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness. Her past medical history of OCD and her anxiety about visiting doctors further support this. Malingering is unlikely as there is no evidence of external incentives. Somatic symptom disorder would involve significant somatic symptoms causing distress, but her symptoms are more about the fear of illness rather than the symptoms themselves. Generalized anxiety disorder involves excessive worry about various aspects of life, not specifically health-related concerns. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is illness anxiety disorder, where the primary concern is the fear of having a serious illness despite reassurance.",9
2903,"The patient's symptoms and history are suggestive of neurosyphilis. The key findings include severe stabbing pain in the lower extremities, unsteadiness, decreased vibration and proprioception sense, absent lower extremity deep tendon reflexes, and a positive Romberg test, which are indicative of tabes dorsalis. The pupillary findings (Argyll Robertson pupils) further support this diagnosis. His sexual history and lack of condom use increase the risk for syphilis. The best treatment for neurosyphilis is intravenous penicillin. Although the patient had a severe allergic reaction to penicillin in the past, the standard treatment for neurosyphilis is still intravenous penicillin, and desensitization may be considered if necessary.",9
2904,"The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings suggest a meniscal injury. The key symptoms include knee pain, locking sensation, and clicking during passive range of motion. These are classic signs of a meniscal tear. The medial joint tenderness and the absence of anterior displacement on the anterior drawer test (which would suggest an ACL injury if positive) further support a meniscal injury rather than a ligamentous one. Given the medial joint tenderness, the medial meniscus is more likely to be involved than the lateral meniscus. Therefore, the structure most likely damaged is the medial meniscus.",9
2860,"The patient's symptoms of worsening dysphagia with a progression from difficulty swallowing solids to liquids, in addition to weight loss, poor dental hygiene, and foul breath, are indicative of a structural or obstructive lesion in the esophagus. Considering his significant smoking history, alcohol abuse, and age, squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus is a strong possibility. Zenker diverticulum can present with foul breath due to food entrapment, but it typically causes dysphagia primarily for solids and is often associated with regurgitation of undigested food. Achalasia would result in difficulty swallowing both solids and liquids from the beginning, and globus hystericus (or globus sensation) is more of a sensation without documented weight loss or progressive dysphagia. Given the smoking and alcohol history, the most likely diagnosis is squamous cell carcinoma.",9
2905,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), including shortness of breath, orthopnea, jugular venous distention, and peripheral edema. The echocardiogram shows symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy and reduced diastolic filling, which are indicative of restrictive cardiomyopathy. The low-voltage QRS complexes on ECG, along with the echocardiographic findings, suggest cardiac amyloidosis. The elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and anemia further support a systemic process. Given the patient's age and the possibility of amyloidosis, multiple myeloma is a likely underlying cause, as it can lead to amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, which affects the heart and causes restrictive cardiomyopathy.",9
2908,"The newborn has signs consistent with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), particularly given the history of breech presentation and the positive Ortolani maneuver (palpable clunk). The ultrasound findings also suggest DDH with an abnormal acetabular angle. In a 2-week-old infant, the most appropriate management for DDH is to use a Pavlik harness, which helps to stabilize the hip joint and promote proper development. MRI and X-ray are not typically used in this age group for initial management, and reassurance without intervention is inappropriate given the clinical findings.",9
2925,"The clinical presentation of recurrent respiratory infections, bulky stools, and a positive sweat chloride test suggests cystic fibrosis. The genetic testing indicates a shortened gene length by one base pair, which is consistent with a frameshift mutation. A frameshift mutation occurs due to the insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of three, leading to a shift in the reading frame. This results in a change in the downstream amino acid sequence and often leads to a premature stop codon. The absence of the typical deletion but a shortened gene length by one base pair aligns with a frameshift mutation.",9
2920,"The clinical presentation suggests an allergic reaction, likely anaphylaxis, given the sudden onset of symptoms including rash, wheezing, and gastrointestinal symptoms after exposure to a potential allergen in the garden. In such allergic reactions, mast cells and basophils play a key role by releasing histamine and other mediators. However, the question asks about the histological findings 4 hours after the reaction. In the context of an acute inflammatory response, neutrophils are typically the first responders and are the predominant cells found in the early stages of inflammation. Therefore, 4 hours after the onset of the reaction, neutrophils would be the main cells found at the site of the skin lesion.",9
2931,"The patient presents with fatigue, weight loss, decreased appetite, and hepatomegaly. Lab results show anemia with low MCV, suggesting microcytic anemia, likely due to iron deficiency. The abdominal ultrasound and CT scan reveal multiple liver lesions, which are concerning for metastatic disease. Given the patient's age and symptoms, colorectal cancer is a common primary source of liver metastases. The next best step is to identify the primary source of the metastases. Colonoscopy is the appropriate diagnostic procedure to evaluate for colorectal cancer, which could explain the liver lesions and the iron deficiency anemia.",9
2929,"The clinical presentation of the child, including fatigue, difficulty rising from a seated position, waddling gait, thick calves, and the use of hands to stand (Gowers' sign), is suggestive of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). The family history of a maternal uncle with similar symptoms indicates an X-linked recessive pattern, which is consistent with DMD. The elevated creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels further support muscle damage. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which encodes the dystrophin protein. The most common type of mutation leading to DMD is a nonsense mutation, which results in a truncated, nonfunctional dystrophin protein. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is a nonsense mutation in the DMD gene.",9
2923,"The patient's symptoms include right lower quadrant abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and a positive fecal occult blood test. His family history of colon cancer and the presence of bloody diarrhea are significant. Appendicitis typically presents with right lower quadrant pain but not bloody diarrhea. Colon cancer is possible given the family history, but the patient's young age makes it less likely. Infectious colitis could cause bloody diarrhea, but the chronic nature of the symptoms and family history suggest otherwise. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, is more consistent with the chronic abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and family history of colon cancer. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is inflammatory bowel disease.",9
2870,"The presentation of a middle-aged woman with morning headaches, papilledema, bradycardia, and elevated blood pressure suggests increased intracranial pressure, likely due to a brain mass. The lack of focal neurological deficits and the CT findings often associated with meningiomas lead the diagnostic consideration. Meningiomas are characterized by spindle cells arranged in a whorled pattern and may have laminated calcifications known as psammoma bodies. This corresponds to option D in the list of biopsy findings.",9
2939,"The patient presents with symptoms and imaging findings consistent with a kidney stone, specifically an 8-mm stone in the right proximal ureter. The urine microscopy shows bipyramidal, envelope-shaped crystals, which are characteristic of calcium oxalate crystals. The patient has a history of gout and type 2 diabetes mellitus and has recently started taking large amounts of a multivitamin supplement. Among the options, vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is known to increase oxalate levels in the urine when taken in large amounts, as it is metabolized to oxalate. This can lead to the formation of calcium oxalate stones. The dental erosions noted in the oral examination could be related to vomiting, which is consistent with the nausea and vomiting symptoms. Therefore, the increased serum concentration of vitamin C due to excessive supplementation is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms.",9
2938,"In this scenario, the patient is pregnant and at 8 weeks gestation. During pregnancy, certain vaccines are recommended to protect both the mother and the fetus. The Tetanus/Diphtheria/Pertussis (Tdap) vaccine is typically given later in pregnancy, around 27-36 weeks, to protect the newborn from pertussis. The Hepatitis B vaccine can be given during pregnancy if needed, but there is no specific indication for it in this case. The Varicella vaccine is a live vaccine and is contraindicated during pregnancy due to potential risks to the fetus. The intramuscular flu vaccine, however, is recommended for all pregnant women during flu season, regardless of the trimester, to protect both the mother and the fetus from influenza. Given that the patient is exposed to children who may carry infections, and considering the safety and benefits of the flu vaccine during pregnancy, the intramuscular flu vaccine is the appropriate choice.",9
2937,"The patient has a history of BCG vaccination, which can cause a false-positive result in a tuberculin skin test (TST). Therefore, TST is not the most appropriate test in this scenario. The interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) is preferred for individuals with a history of BCG vaccination because it is not affected by prior BCG vaccination and provides more specific results for latent tuberculosis infection. Sputum culture and PCR of the sputum are more appropriate for active TB infection, but given the context of evaluating for TB in a routine examination, IGRA is the most suitable choice.",9
2941,"The patient is on warfarin, as indicated by her elevated INR of 3.2, which suggests she is anticoagulated. She is also planned for an emergent exploratory laparotomy. In such cases, it is crucial to reverse the anticoagulation to reduce the risk of bleeding during surgery. Protamine sulfate is used to reverse heparin, not warfarin, so option A is incorrect. Recombinant activated factor VII (option D) is not typically used for routine warfarin reversal. Platelet concentrate (option C) is not indicated here as the primary issue is not thrombocytopenia but anticoagulation. The best approach to reverse warfarin quickly is to administer fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and Vitamin K, which will provide the necessary clotting factors and help normalize the INR. Therefore, the next best step in management is option B.",9
2944,"The patient's presentation includes significant proteinuria (4.5 grams in 24 hours), which is indicative of nephrotic syndrome. The kidney biopsy findings are crucial for diagnosis. Light microscopy shows diffuse thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, and electron microscopy reveals subepithelial spike and dome deposits. These findings are characteristic of membranous nephropathy. 

- Postinfectious glomerulonephritis (A) typically presents with subepithelial humps and is associated with a history of infection.
- Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (B) usually shows segmental sclerosis and hyalinosis on light microscopy.
- Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (C) is characterized by crescent formation on light microscopy.

The combination of thickened basement membrane and subepithelial deposits is classic for membranous nephropathy.",9
2947,"The patient is pregnant and has a confirmed P. falciparum infection in an area with chloroquine resistance. In pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, certain antimalarial drugs are contraindicated due to potential harm to the fetus. Doxycycline is contraindicated in pregnancy due to risks of fetal harm, such as teeth discoloration and inhibition of bone growth. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is also not recommended due to potential teratogenic effects. Mefloquine is generally avoided in the first trimester unless no other options are available. The combination of quinine sulfate and clindamycin is considered safe and effective for treating chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum malaria in pregnant women, especially in the first trimester.",9
2945,"The patient is pregnant and has a confirmed syphilis infection, as indicated by the positive RPR and FTA-ABS tests. The standard treatment for syphilis during pregnancy is penicillin, as it is the only antibiotic known to effectively cross the placenta and treat the fetus. However, the patient reports an allergy to penicillin. In such cases, the recommended approach is to perform penicillin desensitization, allowing the patient to safely receive penicillin. This is crucial because alternative antibiotics are not as effective in preventing congenital syphilis. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to administer a penicillin desensitization dose.",9
2951,"The patient's symptoms and lab findings suggest a condition related to catecholamine excess, likely pheochromocytoma, given the hypertension, headaches, and family history. Pheochromocytomas are tumors of the adrenal medulla that secrete catecholamines. The adrenal medulla cells involved in catecholamine synthesis have an abundance of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER), which is involved in the synthesis of steroid hormones and detoxification processes. Therefore, a biopsy of the adrenal medulla in this patient would show an abnormal increase in the amount of smooth endoplasmic reticulum.",9
2953,"Specificity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those without the disease (true negatives) out of all those who do not have the disease. In this scenario, we have 50 children without ASD. Out of these, 35 tested negative, which are the true negatives. Specificity is calculated as:

Specificity = (True Negatives) / (True Negatives + False Positives)

Here, True Negatives = 35 and False Positives = 15.

Specificity = 35 / (35 + 15) = 35 / 50 = 0.70 or 70%.",10
2959,"The patient is at 40 weeks' gestation and in active labor. The ultrasound shows that the fetal long axis is at a right angle to the maternal uterus, indicating a transverse lie. In a transverse lie, the fetus is positioned sideways in the uterus, which is not compatible with vaginal delivery. At term and in active labor, the most appropriate management for a transverse lie is a cesarean section, as external cephalic version is not recommended during active labor and at term due to the risk of complications. Lateral positioning of the mother or administration of oxytocin would not address the issue of fetal lie and could lead to complications. Therefore, the safest and most appropriate next step is to proceed with a cesarean section.",9
2961,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, which is common in infants around this age. The key features include projectile non-bilious vomiting, palpable 'olive-like' mass in the epigastric region, and signs of dehydration. The laboratory findings show hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, which is typical for this condition due to loss of gastric acid. The most appropriate next step is to stabilize the patient by correcting the dehydration and electrolyte imbalances with IV fluids before any surgical intervention. Therefore, administering IV 0.9% NaCl and replacing electrolytes is the correct initial management step.",9
2966,"The clinical presentation and ultrasound findings suggest a molar pregnancy. The histologic analysis showing both normal and enlarged trophoblastic villi indicates a partial mole. Partial moles are typically associated with a triploid karyotype, often 69 XXY, resulting from fertilization of an egg by two sperm or duplication of a single sperm's chromosomes. Complete moles, on the other hand, are usually diploid and of paternal origin (46 XX or 46 XY). Therefore, the karyotype most consistent with a partial mole is 69 XXY.",9
2973,"The patient is a 75-year-old man with persistent back pain, fatigue, weight loss, and hypercalcemia (elevated calcium level of 12.8 mg/dL). These symptoms are suggestive of multiple myeloma, a plasma cell malignancy. Multiple myeloma often presents with bone pain (due to lytic bone lesions), hypercalcemia, renal impairment, and anemia. The elevated calcium level and back pain are consistent with this diagnosis. In multiple myeloma, the presence of abnormal monoclonal proteins (paraproteins) in the blood can cause red blood cells to stack together, forming rouleaux formations. Therefore, the most likely finding on a peripheral blood smear in this patient would be rouleaux formation.",9
2954,"The patient is experiencing an asthma exacerbation triggered by chemical fumes. Initial treatment with albuterol and IV steroids has been started, which is appropriate. The arterial blood gas shows a pH of 7.36, PCO2 of 41 mm Hg, and PO2 of 79 mm Hg. The pH is slightly acidotic, and the PCO2 is normal, indicating that the patient is not hyperventilating effectively and is at risk of respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory rate has decreased slightly, but he is still in distress with accessory muscle use. Continuing bronchodilator therapy is crucial in this situation. Switching to ipratropium is not indicated as it is not as effective as albuterol for acute exacerbations. Intubation is not immediately necessary as the patient is improving slightly and can now speak. The best step is to continue aggressive bronchodilator therapy with albuterol.",9
2977,"The patient presents with acute monoarthritis, fever, and a painless ulcer on the foot. Given her sexual history and inconsistent condom use, there is a suspicion of septic arthritis, possibly due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The most direct and effective way to diagnose septic arthritis is through arthrocentesis, which allows for synovial fluid analysis, including cell count, culture, and Gram stain. This procedure can confirm the presence of infection and identify the causative organism. MRI and ultrasonography can provide structural information but are not diagnostic for infection. Measuring rheumatoid factor is not relevant in this acute setting and does not address the infectious etiology. Therefore, performing arthrocentesis is the most appropriate step to establish the diagnosis.",9
2974,"The patient is an 8-year-old girl with decreased oral intake, body aches, lymphadenopathy, and a history of playing with cats. She presents with a tender lymph node in the right posterior cervical area and a nearly healed scratch in the right occipital region. The key details are the lymphadenopathy and the scratch, along with her exposure to cats. Bartonella henselae, the causative agent of cat scratch disease, is transmitted through scratches or bites from cats. The symptoms and history are consistent with cat scratch disease, which typically presents with regional lymphadenopathy near the site of the scratch or bite. Other options like extrapulmonary tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, and staphylococcal adenitis are less likely given the specific exposure to cats and the presentation of symptoms.",9
2983,"In this scenario, a medication error occurred where the patient received metoprolol, which was not intended for him. The ethical and professional standards in medicine emphasize transparency and honesty with patients. Even if the patient did not suffer any harm, it is important to maintain trust and integrity in the physician-patient relationship. The patient has the right to know about any errors in their care, regardless of the outcome. Therefore, the attending physician should disclose the error to the patient, explain what happened, and discuss any potential implications, even if they are minimal. This approach aligns with the principles of patient autonomy and informed consent.",9
2981,"The newborn presents with severe weakness, poor muscle tone, weak cry, and difficulty breastfeeding, which are indicative of a neuromuscular disorder. The presence of an enlarged tongue and hypertrophy of the myocardium on ultrasound suggests a metabolic or storage disorder. 

Acid maltase deficiency, also known as Pompe disease, is a glycogen storage disease that can present in infancy with hypotonia, cardiomyopathy, and macroglossia (enlarged tongue). The hypertrophy of the myocardium is consistent with the cardiomyopathy seen in Pompe disease.

Clostridium tetani infection would present with muscle spasms and rigidity, not hypotonia.

Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy typically presents later in life and does not usually cause hypotonia or macroglossia in newborns.

Spinal muscular atrophy type I (Werdnig-Hoffmann disease) presents with hypotonia and weakness but does not typically cause cardiomyopathy or macroglossia.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis given the combination of symptoms is acid maltase deficiency (Pompe disease).",9
2990,"The patient is undergoing external beam radiation therapy for spinal cord compression due to metastatic prostate cancer. Radiation therapy primarily causes damage to cancer cells by generating free radicals, particularly hydroxyl radicals, through the ionization of water molecules. These hydroxyl radicals then cause DNA damage, leading to cell death. This mechanism is distinct from other forms of DNA damage such as pyrimidine dimers (caused by UV radiation), intercalation (caused by certain chemotherapeutic agents), and DNA crosslinks (caused by agents like cisplatin). Therefore, the cellular change most likely to occur as a result of radiation therapy is the generation of hydroxyl radicals.",9
2994,"In this scenario, the patient is unable to communicate her wishes, and there are no advanced directives available. The husband claims that the patient is a Jehovah's Witness and would refuse blood transfusions. However, without documented evidence of the patient's wishes, such as an advance directive or a durable power of attorney for healthcare, the medical team must act in the best interest of the patient to preserve life. In emergency situations where the patient's wishes are not clearly documented, the standard practice is to provide life-saving treatment. Therefore, the appropriate next step is to provide transfusions as needed to stabilize the patient.",9
2998,"The scenario describes a health insurance plan where primary care physicians are paid a fixed amount for each patient enrolled over a specific period, regardless of the number of services provided. This payment model is known as capitation. In capitation, providers receive a set fee per patient, which incentivizes preventive care and cost-effective management of patient health. This contrasts with other models: per diem payment involves daily rates for hospital stays, bundled payment involves a single payment for all services related to a treatment or condition, and discounted fee-for-service involves negotiated lower rates for each service provided.",9
2997,"The patient is on antituberculosis treatment and presents with peripheral neuropathy symptoms, such as tingling and numbness in the feet. These symptoms are commonly associated with isoniazid, a drug used in tuberculosis treatment, which can cause peripheral neuropathy due to pyridoxine (vitamin B6) deficiency. The patient's laboratory findings also indicate microcytic anemia, which could be related to iron deficiency, but the neurological symptoms are more directly linked to pyridoxine deficiency. Supplementation with pyridoxine is known to prevent isoniazid-induced neuropathy.",9
3002,"In evaluating heart murmurs in children, certain characteristics suggest a benign or innocent murmur. Innocent murmurs are typically soft (grade ≤ 2/6), systolic, and often change with position or respiration. They are not associated with any symptoms or signs of cardiac disease.

- Option A describes a systolic ejection murmur that increases with Valsalva, which is more typical of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, not a benign murmur.
- Option B describes a midsystolic murmur that increases with squatting, which is more typical of aortic stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, not a benign murmur.
- Option C describes a continuous murmur at the right supraclavicular region, which is characteristic of a venous hum, a common benign murmur in children.
- Option D describes a holosystolic murmur that increases with hand grip, which is more typical of a ventricular septal defect, not a benign murmur.

Therefore, the murmur described in option C is most consistent with a benign murmur.",9
3000,"The patient is a 72-year-old man with severe lower back pain, fatigue, and anemia (hemoglobin 9 g/dL). The anemia is normocytic (MCV 90 μm3). He also has hypercalcemia (calcium 11.5 mg/dL) and renal impairment (creatinine 2.5 mg/dL, urea nitrogen 54 mg/dL). The CT scan shows low-density lesions in the lumbar vertebra and pelvic bones. These findings are suggestive of multiple myeloma, which is characterized by bone pain, anemia, renal failure, and hypercalcemia. The low-density lesions on CT are likely lytic bone lesions, which are common in multiple myeloma due to osteoclast activation by myeloma cells. Metastatic prostatic cancer typically causes sclerotic (not lytic) bone lesions. Secondary hyperparathyroidism usually does not cause lytic bone lesions or anemia. Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia is associated with hyperviscosity and IgM paraprotein, but not typically with lytic bone lesions or hypercalcemia.",9
3006,"The patient has a displaced comminuted fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus, and during surgery, a neurovascular structure piercing the coracobrachialis muscle is injured. The structure that pierces the coracobrachialis is the musculocutaneous nerve. The musculocutaneous nerve innervates the anterior compartment of the arm, including the biceps brachii, brachialis, and coracobrachialis muscles. It is responsible for elbow flexion and supination of the forearm. Additionally, it provides sensory innervation to the lateral aspect of the forearm via the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm. Therefore, injury to the musculocutaneous nerve would most likely result in a defect in lateral forearm skin sensation.",9
3014,"The patient is an 11-year-old girl with frothy brown urine, elevated blood pressure, and a recent history of a sore throat and fever. The laboratory findings show elevated serum creatinine, hematuria with RBC casts, and elevated urine protein. These findings suggest a glomerular cause of hematuria and proteinuria. The recent sore throat and fever, occurring approximately 2 weeks before the onset of symptoms, are suggestive of a preceding streptococcal infection. This temporal relationship is characteristic of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN), which typically occurs 1-3 weeks after a streptococcal throat infection. The presence of RBC casts and hypertension further supports this diagnosis. Alport syndrome is a hereditary condition associated with hearing loss and eye abnormalities, which are not mentioned here. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and Henoch-Schönlein purpura have different clinical presentations and are less likely given the history and findings.",9
3010,"The patient presents with hypercalcemia, elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH), and hypercalciuria, which are indicative of primary hyperparathyroidism. She also has hypertension and kidney stones, which are complications associated with this condition. The elevated PTH and hypercalcemia, along with the presence of kidney stones, make her a candidate for surgical intervention. Cinacalcet is typically used for secondary hyperparathyroidism or when surgery is not an option. Hydrochlorothiazide would increase calcium reabsorption and is not appropriate here. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy is a procedure for removing kidney stones but does not address the underlying cause. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to refer her for parathyroidectomy.",9
3019,"The patient is experiencing an acute exacerbation of COPD, characterized by increased dyspnea, increased sputum production, and hypoxemia. The management of an acute COPD exacerbation typically includes bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and sometimes antibiotics if there is evidence of infection. Albuterol, a short-acting beta-agonist, is used for quick relief of bronchospasm. Systemic corticosteroids like prednisone are used to reduce inflammation and improve lung function. Montelukast and theophylline are not typically used in the acute setting. Therefore, the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy is a combination of a bronchodilator (albuterol) and a corticosteroid (prednisone).",9
3020,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of hemolytic anemia: low hemoglobin, elevated indirect bilirubin, elevated LDH, and low haptoglobin. The presence of spherocytes on the peripheral blood smear suggests either hereditary spherocytosis or autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). The presence of scleral icterus and the history of recent respiratory symptoms with patchy infiltrates could suggest a possible autoimmune process. To differentiate between hereditary spherocytosis and AIHA, the Direct Coombs test (Direct Antiglobulin Test) is used to detect antibodies or complement on the surface of red blood cells, which would confirm AIHA. The osmotic fragility test is used for hereditary spherocytosis, but given the clinical context and the need to confirm AIHA, the Direct Coombs test is more appropriate.",9
3024,"The physical exam maneuver described is the anterior drawer test, which is used to assess the integrity of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). In this test, the tibia is pulled forward relative to the femur, and excessive movement indicates a torn ACL. The ACL originates from the anterior intercondylar area of the tibia and attaches to the posteromedial aspect of the lateral femur. Therefore, the correct attachment points for the ACL are described in option B.",9
3028,"The patient presents with fever, confusion, autonomic instability (elevated heart rate and blood pressure), diaphoresis, and increased muscle tone, which are indicative of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). NMS is a life-threatening condition associated with the use of antipsychotic medications, such as chlorpromazine. The elevated creatine kinase level supports muscle breakdown, which is common in NMS. The most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy for NMS is dantrolene, which helps reduce muscle rigidity and hyperthermia.",9
3037,"The patient has gestational diabetes, as indicated by the elevated glucose levels on the glucose tolerance test. Infants born to mothers with gestational diabetes are at risk for several complications, including macrosomia, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, and respiratory distress syndrome. Among the options provided, hypocalcemia is a known complication in infants of diabetic mothers due to the effects of maternal hyperglycemia on fetal calcium metabolism. Omphalocele is a congenital defect not directly related to gestational diabetes. Intrauterine growth restriction is more commonly associated with conditions like preeclampsia or placental insufficiency, rather than gestational diabetes. Hypermagnesemia is not a typical complication of gestational diabetes. Therefore, the infant is at greatest risk of developing hypocalcemia at birth.",9
3038,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a pheochromocytoma, a tumor of the adrenal medulla that secretes catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine). This condition is associated with symptoms such as headaches, sweating, palpitations, and hypertension. The presence of mucosal neuromas suggests a possible MEN 2B syndrome, which includes medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and mucosal neuromas. The catecholamine surge from pheochromocytoma can cause vasoconstriction, leading to pale skin. Other symptoms like bronchospasm and decreased cardiac contractility are not typically associated with pheochromocytoma. Bradycardia is also unlikely due to the adrenergic effects causing tachycardia instead.",9
3042,"The patient's symptoms include widespread musculoskeletal pain, tenderness in specific areas (posterior neck, trapezius, knee), and normal muscle strength. The pain worsens with exercise and lack of sleep, and she has associated symptoms like stiffness and tingling. Her laboratory tests and imaging are normal, which rules out inflammatory or structural causes. These features are characteristic of fibromyalgia, a condition marked by chronic widespread pain and tenderness at specific points, often accompanied by fatigue, sleep disturbances, and mood disorders. Polymyalgia rheumatica typically affects older adults and presents with elevated inflammatory markers, which are not present here. Polymyositis would show muscle weakness and elevated muscle enzymes. Major depressive disorder could explain some symptoms but not the specific pattern of musculoskeletal pain and tenderness.",9
3032,"The infant presents with symptoms that suggest a metabolic disorder, particularly involving carbohydrate metabolism. The key symptoms include vomiting, convulsions, poor feeding, irritability, jaundice, and hepatosplenomegaly. These symptoms, along with the history of worsening condition after introduction of baby foods, suggest a disorder related to fructose or galactose metabolism.

Galactosemia, caused by a deficiency in Gal-1-phosphate uridyl transferase, typically presents with jaundice, hepatomegaly, and feeding difficulties soon after birth when the infant is exposed to lactose in breast milk or formula. However, the symptoms here worsened after the introduction of baby foods, which is more suggestive of a fructose metabolism disorder.

Hereditary fructose intolerance, caused by a deficiency in Aldolase B, presents with symptoms after the introduction of fructose-containing foods (such as fruits, vegetables, and certain baby foods). Symptoms include vomiting, hypoglycemia, jaundice, hepatomegaly, and potentially seizures due to hypoglycemia. The timing of symptom onset and the specific symptoms match this condition.

Fructokinase deficiency (essential fructosuria) is benign and does not cause the symptoms seen here.

Lactase deficiency would cause lactose intolerance, not the symptoms described.

Therefore, the enzyme most likely functioning abnormally in this patient is Aldolase B.",9
3044,"In this study, the main issue is the potential for response bias. The participants in the study were aware of which treatment they were receiving because the new drug was administered as a powder mixed with water, while verapamil was given as a pill. This lack of blinding among participants could lead to response bias, where participants' knowledge of their treatment influences their reporting of pain alleviation. Observer bias is unlikely because the researchers assessing the outcomes were blinded to treatment assignment. Convenience sampling bias is not relevant here as the study involved randomization. Intention to treat bias refers to issues with handling data from participants who do not adhere to the study protocol, which is not a problem in this study as there was no loss to follow-up or skipped treatments.",9
3047,"Paroxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) commonly used to treat major depressive disorder. SSRIs, including paroxetine, are known to have several potential side effects. Urinary retention is not commonly associated with SSRIs; it is more typical of anticholinergic medications. Increased suicidality is a concern, particularly in younger populations, but this patient is 32 years old, and the risk is more pronounced in adolescents and young adults. Priapism is a rare side effect more commonly associated with medications like trazodone. Decreased libido is a well-known and common side effect of SSRIs, including paroxetine, due to their impact on serotonin levels, which can affect sexual function.",9
3045,"The patient is a 15-year-old girl presenting with symptoms of lethargy, increased thirst, and urinary frequency, along with hyperglycemia (serum glucose of 224 mg/dL) and ketonuria. These findings are suggestive of diabetic ketoacidosis, which is commonly associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). T1DM is an autoimmune condition characterized by the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreatic islets. The pathogenesis involves T-cell mediated autoimmune destruction of these cells. This is consistent with the presence of ketones in the urine, indicating a lack of insulin and subsequent fat breakdown for energy. Therefore, the most likely mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition is T-cell infiltration of pancreatic islets.",9
3049,"The patient underwent general anesthesia with inhaled anesthetic agents. After stopping the anesthesia, the oxygen saturation decreased, which improved with 100% oxygen administration. This scenario is characteristic of diffusion hypoxia, which occurs when nitrous oxide is used as an inhaled anesthetic. When nitrous oxide is discontinued, it rapidly diffuses out of the blood into the alveoli, diluting the oxygen and carbon dioxide in the alveoli, leading to decreased oxygen saturation. Administering 100% oxygen counteracts this effect by increasing the alveolar oxygen concentration.",9
3056,"The patient is experiencing an acute asthma exacerbation, characterized by severe shortness of breath, wheezing, and confusion, which suggests significant respiratory distress. In such cases, rapid bronchodilation is necessary to relieve symptoms. Inhaled albuterol, a short-acting beta-2 agonist, is the drug of choice for quickly reversing bronchospasm and improving airflow in acute asthma attacks. Other options like cromolyn, beclomethasone, and montelukast are not suitable for immediate relief as they are used for long-term control and prevention of asthma symptoms.",9
3043,"In a cross-sectional study, all patients are assessed at a single point in time. The study involves patients with confirmed bronchogenic carcinoma, and the data collected includes various clinical features. The potential bias in this scenario is related to the tendency to observe cases that are already diagnosed, which might lead to an overrepresentation of certain types of cases. 

The key point here is that cross-sectional studies can be prone to 'survivor bias' or 'length-time bias.' This means that more indolent cases, which have a longer duration, are more likely to be detected because they remain in the population longer. In contrast, more aggressive cases might progress rapidly and lead to death before they can be included in the study. Therefore, the study might preferentially uncover more indolent cases of the disease, leading to an underestimation of the aggressiveness and mortality of bronchogenic carcinoma.",9
3058,"The patient has signs of advanced liver cirrhosis, including ascites, jaundice, and hepatic encephalopathy. He also has complications of portal hypertension, such as varices and hemorrhoids. A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is a procedure used to reduce portal hypertension by creating a channel between the portal and systemic venous systems. The most common and well-established indication for TIPS is recurrent variceal hemorrhage that is not controlled by medical or endoscopic therapy. While TIPS can also be used for refractory ascites and hepatic hydrothorax, the best-established indication remains recurrent variceal hemorrhage.",9
3057,"The patient presents with new-onset asthma, peripheral neuropathy (bilateral foot drop and numbness/tingling), and eosinophilia. These symptoms are suggestive of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome. EGPA is characterized by asthma, eosinophilia, and systemic vasculitis affecting small to medium-sized vessels, often leading to neuropathy. A common serological marker associated with EGPA is p-ANCA (perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies), which can be present in patients with this condition. Therefore, the marker that could explain all of the patient’s symptoms is p-ANCA.",9
3054,"The patient presents with symptoms of heart failure, likely due to his history of myocardial infarction and hypertension. On admission, he has signs of fluid overload, such as shortness of breath, orthopnea, and lower limb edema, along with an S3 gallop and a holosystolic murmur, suggesting mitral regurgitation. The initial treatment for acute decompensated heart failure often includes diuretics to reduce fluid overload. The next day, the patient shows a decrease in sodium (hyponatremia), a significant drop in potassium (hypokalemia), and an increase in BUN and creatinine, indicating prerenal azotemia. These changes are consistent with the effects of diuretic therapy, which can cause electrolyte imbalances and dehydration, leading to increased BUN and creatinine levels. Cholesterol emboli, glomerular basement membrane damage, and urinary tract obstruction would not typically cause these specific laboratory changes in this context.",9
3065,"The patient presents with infertility, low libido, gynecomastia, small testes, elevated LH and FSH, and azoospermia. These findings suggest a condition related to hypogonadism and testicular dysfunction. The elevated LH and FSH indicate hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, which is consistent with testicular failure. The presence of gynecomastia and small testes, along with the tall stature, are characteristic of Klinefelter syndrome, which is caused by the presence of an extra X chromosome (47,XXY). This results in the presence of a Barr body, which is an inactivated X chromosome. Therefore, the most likely cause of this man's infertility is the presence of a Barr body, indicating Klinefelter syndrome.",9
3061,"The patient's sudden onset of pain, tingling, weakness, and absent pedal pulses in the right leg suggests acute limb ischemia. The risk factors include a history of smoking, hypertension, and diabetes. The sudden nature of the symptoms, along with the absence of trauma or claudication, points towards an embolic event rather than a gradual process like atherosclerosis. Arterial embolism is often characterized by the sudden onset of symptoms due to a clot traveling from another location, such as the heart, and lodging in a peripheral artery. This is consistent with the acute presentation and the absence of pulses.",9
3066,"The patient has developed acute kidney injury (AKI) with eosinophilia after starting furosemide. This presentation is suggestive of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), which is often caused by medications such as antibiotics, NSAIDs, and diuretics like furosemide. AIN is characterized by the presence of eosinophils in the urine, but the classic finding on urinalysis is white blood cell casts, not red blood cell casts. However, the question asks for the most likely expected finding, and leukocyte esterase positive is indicative of the presence of white blood cells in the urine, which aligns with AIN.",9
3071,"In this scenario, the physician must balance respect for the patient's autonomy with cultural sensitivity. The patient's right to know about his own health condition is a fundamental ethical principle in Western medicine. However, cultural differences may influence how information is shared within families. The appropriate first step is to explore the family's reasoning to understand their perspective and cultural context. This approach allows the physician to gather more information and potentially find a culturally sensitive way to involve the patient in decision-making. Therefore, the best initial response is to explore the children's reasoning.",9
3073,"The clinical presentation described is consistent with herpangina, which is characterized by fever, sore throat, and vesicular lesions on the tonsillar pillars and soft palate. These lesions are typically caused by Coxsackievirus A, a member of the enterovirus family. The fact that the lesions resolve without treatment in a few days further supports this diagnosis. Herpes simplex virus type 1 typically causes gingivostomatitis with more widespread oral lesions, and varicella-zoster virus causes chickenpox or shingles, which have different presentations. Type 2 sensitivity reaction is not relevant to this clinical scenario.",9
3075,"The patient presented with symptoms and ECG findings consistent with an acute myocardial infarction (MI), specifically an inferior wall MI due to ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. The administration of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) suggests an attempt to reperfuse the occluded coronary artery. Unfortunately, the patient developed ventricular fibrillation and died. In the context of an acute MI, the expected pathological finding in the heart muscle is coagulative necrosis. This type of necrosis is characteristic of ischemic injury in most tissues, including the heart, due to the denaturation of proteins and enzymes, which preserves the basic outline of the cells. Caseous necrosis is associated with tuberculosis, liquefactive necrosis is typical of brain infarcts or bacterial infections, and fibrinoid necrosis is associated with immune-mediated vascular damage. Therefore, the most likely pathological finding in this case is coagulative necrosis.",9
3051,,0
3092,"The clinical presentation and echocardiography findings suggest the patient has truncus arteriosus, a condition where a single arterial trunk arises from the heart, supplying both systemic and pulmonary circulations. This condition is due to the failure of the truncal and aorticopulmonary septa to form, which is a result of the failure of neural crest cell migration. Neural crest cells are crucial for the development of the conotruncal region of the heart, and their failure to migrate properly can lead to conotruncal abnormalities such as truncus arteriosus.",9
3078,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the gastrointestinal tract. The key features include right lower quadrant abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, macrocytic anemia (elevated MCV), and elevated ESR. The colonoscopy findings of focal ulcerations with polypoid changes and biopsy showing acute and chronic inflammation are indicative of Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease commonly affects the terminal ileum, which can explain the right lower quadrant pain and malabsorption leading to macrocytic anemia (possibly due to vitamin B12 deficiency). The ileum is the most likely site involved in this patient's presentation.",9
3088,"The patient is receiving radiation therapy before surgery to destroy malignant cells. This approach is typically used to shrink tumors and make them more manageable for surgical removal. This type of therapy is known as induction therapy, which is given as an initial treatment to reduce the tumor burden before the main treatment, such as surgery.",9
3095,"The patient has sickle cell disease and a history of functional hyposplenism, which is common in sickle cell patients due to repeated splenic infarctions leading to autosplenectomy. The spleen normally removes certain types of abnormal red blood cells and nuclear remnants. In the absence of a functional spleen, Howell-Jolly bodies, which are nuclear remnants, can be seen in the peripheral blood smear. These are typically removed by a healthy spleen, so their presence indicates splenic dysfunction or absence.",9
3108,"To calculate the absolute bioavailability (F) of a drug, we use the formula:

F = (AUC_sublingual / AUC_intravenous) * (Dose_intravenous / Dose_sublingual)

Given:
- AUC_intravenous = 15 mg hr/L
- AUC_sublingual = 20 mg hr/L
- Dose_intravenous = 10 mg
- Dose_sublingual = 25 mg

Substitute these values into the formula:

F = (20 / 15) * (10 / 25)

F = (4/3) * (2/5)

F = 8/15

Convert this fraction to a percentage:

F = (8/15) * 100% = 53.33%

Rounding to the nearest whole number gives 53%.",10
3101,"The patient is a young woman with severe abdominal and lower back pain that is cramping in nature and occurs cyclically, roughly 1 month apart. Her menstrual history indicates that she soaks through 1 pad in a day, which is not excessive bleeding. She is sexually active without contraception, but her pelvic exam is unremarkable with no adnexal masses or cervical motion tenderness, making an ectopic pregnancy less likely. Appendicitis typically presents with localized right lower quadrant pain and systemic signs of infection, which are absent here. Leiomyomas (fibroids) can cause heavy menstrual bleeding and pelvic pain, but the patient's bleeding is not heavy, and there are no masses on exam. The cyclic nature of the pain, coinciding with her menstrual cycle, and the absence of other findings suggest primary dysmenorrhea, which is common in young women and characterized by cramping pain during menstruation without any pelvic pathology.",9
3109,"The patient is likely suffering from aspiration pneumonia, given his history of alcohol intoxication and decreased breath sounds in the right lower lobe. Aspiration pneumonia is commonly caused by anaerobic bacteria and certain aerobic bacteria. In alcoholics, Klebsiella pneumoniae is a common cause of pneumonia, especially when aspiration is involved. Klebsiella pneumoniae is a Gram-negative organism known for producing mucoid colonies on MacConkey agar due to its polysaccharide capsule. This feature matches option D.",9
3124,"The question describes a method involving chromogenic substrates and enzyme-mediated color changes, which is characteristic of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). ELISAs are commonly used for detecting specific proteins or antigens in various samples. 

- ABO blood typing (A) typically involves agglutination reactions, not enzyme-mediated color changes.
- Anti-D antibodies (B) are detected using agglutination tests, such as the indirect Coombs test, rather than chromogenic substrates.
- P24 antigen (C) is a protein associated with HIV, and its detection is commonly performed using ELISA, which fits the description of using chromogenic substrates and enzyme-mediated color changes.
- Epstein-Barr virus infection (D) is usually diagnosed with serological tests that detect antibodies, not typically using chromogenic substrates.

Therefore, the detection of the P24 antigen using ELISA is the method that matches the described technique.",9
3126,"The patient is a 17-year-old female who has not experienced menarche and presents with headaches and vision loss. Her physical examination shows Tanner stage I breast and pubic hair development, indicating a lack of secondary sexual characteristics. This suggests hypogonadism, likely due to a deficiency in gonadotropins (LH and FSH), which are responsible for stimulating ovarian function and the development of secondary sexual characteristics. The MRI likely shows a pituitary tumor, such as a prolactinoma, which can cause inhibition of gonadotropin release due to increased prolactin levels. Elevated prolactin can inhibit the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), leading to decreased LH and FSH, and subsequently, delayed puberty and amenorrhea. Therefore, the inhibition of gonadotropins is the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms.",9
3125,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with Osgood-Schlatter disease, which is characterized by pain and swelling at the tibial tuberosity. This condition is common in adolescents who are active in sports, due to repetitive stress and traction on the growth plate at the tibial tubercle by the quadriceps muscle via the patellar tendon. The pain is typically exacerbated by activities that involve knee extension, such as running, jumping, or kneeling, which aligns with the patient's presentation. The x-ray would likely show fragmentation or irregularity of the tibial tuberosity, supporting the diagnosis of traction apophysitis of the tibial tubercle.",9
3117,"The patient presents with skin discoloration, itching, pain, and swelling around the right ankle, which worsens after prolonged standing. She has hyperpigmentation, dry and scaly skin, superficial varicosities, and a small ulcer near the medial malleolus. These findings are consistent with venous insufficiency, leading to stasis dermatitis. The presence of an intramural thrombus in the popliteal vein further supports venous stasis. Her diabetes and use of oral contraceptives may contribute to her condition. The hyperpigmentation and ulceration are typical of stasis dermatitis, not basal cell carcinoma, atopic dermatitis, or cellulitis.",9
3128,"The patient presents with symptoms of pancytopenia: anemia (low hemoglobin), leukopenia (low leukocyte count), and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count). The reticulocyte count is low, indicating decreased production of red blood cells. The bone marrow biopsy shows hypocellularity without any abnormal cell populations, which suggests a lack of blood cell production rather than destruction or infiltration by abnormal cells. This presentation is consistent with aplastic anemia, where the bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells. Infectious mononucleosis typically presents with lymphocytosis and not pancytopenia. Acute lymphocytic leukemia would show abnormal cells in the bone marrow. Drug-induced immune pancytopenia would typically have a history of drug exposure and might not show hypocellularity on biopsy.",9
3133,"The patient is a 22-year-old woman with a positive pregnancy test and a serum β-hCG level of 805 mIU/mL. She presents with nausea and vomiting but no abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding. Her history includes inconsistent use of oral contraceptives and previous pelvic inflammatory disease, which increases her risk for ectopic pregnancy. 

The serum β-hCG level is below the discriminatory zone (typically around 1500-2000 mIU/mL), where an intrauterine pregnancy can usually be visualized on transvaginal ultrasound. Therefore, an immediate ultrasound may not be conclusive. 

The most appropriate next step is to repeat the transvaginal ultrasound in a few days to allow the β-hCG levels to rise, which may help in visualizing the pregnancy location. This approach helps in differentiating between an early intrauterine pregnancy and an ectopic pregnancy. 

Administering methotrexate or misoprostol, or scheduling dilation and evacuation, are not appropriate at this stage without further diagnostic confirmation of the pregnancy location.",9
3135,"Digoxin is known to have two primary effects: it increases cardiac contractility and it slows conduction through the AV node. The increase in cardiac contractility is due to inhibition of the Na+/K+ ATPase, which indirectly increases intracellular calcium. However, the slowing of AV nodal conduction, which is reflected in the prolongation of the PR interval on the ECG, is primarily due to an increase in vagal tone. Digoxin enhances vagal activity, which increases parasympathetic (vagal) input to the heart, particularly affecting the AV node and slowing conduction. This is why the PR interval is prolonged in this patient after starting digoxin.",9
3140,"The patient's symptoms of worsening chest pain and breathlessness during exercise, along with the murmur heard in the 2nd right intercostal space, suggest aortic stenosis. The location of the murmur is typical for aortic valve issues. In a 52-year-old woman, the most common causes of aortic stenosis are congenital bicuspid aortic valve (leading to early calcification) and degenerative calcific aortic stenosis. Given the age of the patient and the absence of a history of serious illness, congenital leaflet fusion, such as a bicuspid aortic valve, is a likely cause. This condition can lead to early calcification and stenosis, causing the symptoms described.",9
3132,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), given his hypertension, bilateral flank masses, hematuria, proteinuria, and family history of renal disease. ADPKD is associated with the development of cerebral aneurysms, which can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, the question asks about the risk of developing a specific condition, and among the options provided, mitral valve prolapse is a known association with ADPKD. While cerebral aneurysms are a more common concern, mitral valve prolapse is a condition that these patients are also at risk for developing.",9
3147,"The patient is in shock, likely due to intra-abdominal bleeding from the motor vehicle collision, as indicated by hypotension, tachycardia, and abdominal tenderness. The inconclusive FAST exam suggests that further evaluation is needed to confirm intra-abdominal injury. In a hemodynamically unstable patient with suspected intra-abdominal hemorrhage and inconclusive FAST, the next step is to quickly determine the presence of blood in the peritoneal cavity. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) is a rapid and effective method to detect intra-abdominal bleeding when FAST is inconclusive and the patient is unstable. CT scan is not appropriate due to the patient's instability, and exploratory laparotomy is premature without confirming intra-abdominal bleeding. An X-ray would not provide the necessary information in this scenario.",9
3137,"To estimate the filtered load of urea, we need to calculate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and then use it to find the filtered load of urea.

1. **Calculate Renal Plasma Flow (RPF):**
   - PAH is used to estimate effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) because it is both filtered and secreted by the kidneys.
   - ERPF = (Urine PAH concentration × Urine flow rate) / Plasma PAH concentration.
   - ERPF = (3.74 mg/mL × 1.66 mL/min) / 0.01 mg/mL = 620.84 mL/min.

2. **Calculate GFR:**
   - Filtration fraction (FF) = GFR / RPF.
   - Given FF = 20% = 0.2.
   - GFR = FF × RPF = 0.2 × 620.84 mL/min = 124.17 mL/min.

3. **Calculate Filtered Load of Urea:**
   - Filtered load = GFR × Plasma concentration of urea.
   - Filtered load = 124.17 mL/min × 0.2 mg/mL = 24.834 mg/min.

The closest answer choice to this calculation is 25 mg/min.",9
3158,"The patient presents with symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and has a history of pulmonary embolism. The key laboratory finding is insensitivity to activated protein C, which suggests a resistance to the anticoagulant effects of activated protein C. This is characteristic of Factor V Leiden mutation, where a mutation in the factor V gene makes it resistant to inactivation by activated protein C, leading to a hypercoagulable state. This condition is the most common inherited thrombophilia and would explain the recurrent thrombotic events in this patient.",9
3154,"The patient's symptoms of progressive left leg weakness, paresthesias, and headaches, along with the neurological exam findings of increased deep tendon reflexes on the left, suggest a central nervous system lesion. The MRI of the brain likely shows a mass lesion, possibly a meningioma or another type of brain tumor, given the chronicity and progression of symptoms. In such cases, surgical resection is often the most appropriate next step, especially if the lesion is accessible and causing significant symptoms. Stereotactic brain biopsy is typically used for diagnostic purposes when the nature of the lesion is unclear, but in this case, the symptoms and imaging likely point towards a resectable lesion. Stereotactic radiosurgery and intrathecal methotrexate are not first-line treatments for a resectable brain tumor causing significant symptoms.",9
3149,"The clinical presentation is consistent with an anterior shoulder dislocation, as indicated by the externally rotated and slightly abducted position of the arm, tenderness, and an empty glenoid fossa. The humeral head is palpated below the coracoid process, which is typical for anterior dislocations. Before performing a reduction, it is important to assess for any nerve injury, particularly to the axillary nerve, which can be affected in shoulder dislocations. Testing sensation over the lateral shoulder can help assess axillary nerve function.",9
3171,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a diagnosis of onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, which is caused by the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus. This condition is transmitted by the bite of infected black flies. The symptoms include skin changes such as itchy nodules and potential vision problems due to microfilariae migrating to the eyes. The appropriate treatment for onchocerciasis is ivermectin, which is effective against the microfilariae of Onchocerca volvulus. Diethylcarbamazine is used for lymphatic filariasis, mebendazole is used for intestinal helminths, and nifurtimox is used for Chagas disease.",9
3166,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a systemic condition affecting both the lungs and kidneys. The combination of respiratory symptoms (dry cough, coarse breath sounds) and renal findings (hematuria, proteinuria, and red blood cell casts) is indicative of a pulmonary-renal syndrome. The presence of red blood cell casts suggests glomerulonephritis. The history of a sore throat followed by these symptoms could suggest a post-infectious process, but the key here is the combination of lung and kidney involvement. Microscopic polyangiitis is a small vessel vasculitis that can cause both pulmonary and renal symptoms, fitting the presentation of this patient. Diffuse membranous glomerulopathy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis typically do not present with pulmonary symptoms. Transitional cell bladder carcinoma would not cause red blood cell casts or pulmonary symptoms.",9
3175,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are suggestive of ulcerative colitis. She has lower abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and weight loss, which are common symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease. The positive perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA) and negative anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) are more commonly associated with ulcerative colitis than Crohn's disease. On colonoscopy, ulcerative colitis typically shows confluent inflammation of the colonic mucosa, with edema, fibrin-covered ulcers, and loss of vascular pattern. This is in contrast to Crohn's disease, which would show patchy inflammation and a cobblestone appearance. Pseudomembranes are associated with Clostridium difficile infection, and numerous polyps would suggest familial adenomatous polyposis.",9
3178,"The clinical presentation and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings suggest viral encephalitis. The key features include the patient's recent activities (spelunking and swimming in freshwater), fever, altered mental status, and MRI findings of asymmetrical, bitemporal hyperintensities. The CSF analysis shows lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and normal glucose, which are consistent with viral infection. The presence of bitemporal hyperintensities on MRI is particularly suggestive of herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis, which typically affects the temporal lobes. The other options, such as West Nile virus, La Crosse virus, and enterovirus, do not typically present with these specific MRI findings.",9
3174,"The patient presents with sudden onset of slurred speech, left facial droop, and numbness on the left side of the face, which are classic symptoms of a neurological event. Given her risk factors, including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and smoking, she is at high risk for cerebrovascular disease. The symptoms resolved spontaneously within a short period (30 minutes), which is characteristic of a transient ischemic attack (TIA). A TIA is a temporary period of neurological dysfunction caused by ischemia without acute infarction, often resolving within 24 hours. The normal CT scan supports the absence of acute infarction. Conversion disorder is unlikely given the clear vascular risk factors and resolution of symptoms. Partial seizure and multiple sclerosis are less likely given the presentation and resolution of symptoms.",9
3180,"The patient's symptoms and findings suggest pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), likely due to an infection associated with the retained intrauterine device (IUD). The most common organisms causing PID are Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. Chlamydia trachomatis is often treated with azithromycin or doxycycline, which are protein synthesis inhibitors, but the question asks for the most likely cause and its treatment mechanism. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is treated with ceftriaxone, a cephalosporin, which is a cell wall synthesis inhibitor. Given the context of PID and the presence of a retained IUD, the most likely bacterial cause is Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and the treatment involves a cell wall synthesis inhibitor.",9
3182,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), characterized by chronic anxiety, difficulty controlling worry, sleep disturbances, irritability, and muscle tension. First-line pharmacological treatment for GAD typically involves selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Paroxetine is an SSRI and is commonly used as a first-line treatment for GAD. Propranolol is used for performance anxiety, alprazolam is a benzodiazepine used for short-term relief, and lurasidone is an antipsychotic used for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, not anxiety disorders.",9
3183,"The patient's symptoms and CT findings suggest Parinaud syndrome, which is associated with a pineal gland tumor, likely a germinoma. The upward gaze palsy, convergence-retraction nystagmus, and papilledema are indicative of this condition. The mass in the epithalamus is causing compression of the tectal plate, leading to these symptoms. Parinaud syndrome is also associated with pseudo-Argyll Robertson pupils, which react to accommodation but not to light, due to the involvement of the dorsal midbrain.",9
3194,"The child in the scenario is diagnosed with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), which is characterized by recurrent infections, failure to thrive, and lymphopenia. SCID can be caused by several genetic defects. The most common form of SCID is X-linked SCID, which is due to a mutation in the IL2RG gene that encodes the common gamma chain, a component of several interleukin receptors. This form accounts for about 50% of SCID cases. Other forms include adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency, which is autosomal recessive and accounts for about 15% of cases, and other less common genetic defects. Given that X-linked SCID is the most common form, it is the most likely association with this type of immunodeficiency.",9
3186,"The patient's symptoms include aggressive behavior, rotary nystagmus, and autonomic instability (elevated temperature and increased respiratory rate). These are classic signs of phencyclidine hydrochloride (PCP) intoxication. PCP is known to cause nystagmus, particularly rotary or horizontal nystagmus, and can lead to violent behavior and altered mental status. The other options, such as marijuana, methamphetamine, and cocaine, do not typically cause rotary nystagmus. Methamphetamine and cocaine can cause agitation and increased vital signs, but the presence of nystagmus strongly points towards PCP.",9
3193,"The clinical presentation and microbiological findings are key to identifying the causal pathogen. The patient has a painless swelling on the jaw that is draining foul-smelling fluid, which is consistent with a chronic infection. The history of a recent molar extraction suggests a possible dental origin. The culture shows catalase-negative, gram-positive filamentous rods that do not stain with carbol fuchsin. 

Actinomyces israelii is a gram-positive, filamentous bacterium that is part of the normal oral flora and can cause cervicofacial actinomycosis, especially following dental procedures. It is catalase-negative and does not stain with carbol fuchsin, which is used in acid-fast staining. This differentiates it from Nocardia species, which are partially acid-fast and catalase-positive.

Acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative bacterium, Streptococcus pneumoniae is a gram-positive coccus, and Nocardia asteroides is a gram-positive, partially acid-fast filamentous bacterium. Therefore, the description fits Actinomyces israelii best.",9
3191,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of diabetes mellitus, such as polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, and fatigue. The elevated serum osmolality and low bicarbonate level suggest a metabolic acidosis, which can be seen in diabetic ketoacidosis. The history of autoimmune disease (Hashimoto thyroiditis) increases the risk for other autoimmune conditions, including type 1 diabetes. The most direct and helpful test to confirm diabetes mellitus is a serum glucose measurement, which would likely show hyperglycemia if diabetes is present.",9
3195,"The patient is a 68-year-old man with a 1-year history of worsening forgetfulness and confusion, which are hallmark symptoms of dementia. His MMSE score is 20/30, indicating cognitive impairment. The history provided by his wife suggests memory issues and some executive dysfunction (e.g., forgetting to put on socks and agitation). There is no history of depression, sleep problems, or substance abuse, and his medical history is unremarkable. Imaging and laboratory tests show no significant abnormalities, ruling out secondary causes of dementia. 

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (B) typically presents with rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus, and other neurological signs, which are not described here. Parkinson’s disease (C) would present with motor symptoms such as tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia, which are absent. Vascular dementia (D) often presents with a stepwise decline and is associated with cerebrovascular events, which are not indicated here.

The gradual progression of memory loss and cognitive decline without other neurological symptoms or vascular events is most consistent with Alzheimer’s dementia (A).",9
3197,"The patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with a major depressive episode, including persistent sadness, fatigue, insomnia, weight loss, and feelings of guilt. She also has a history of anorexia nervosa and is currently underweight with a BMI of 18.4 kg/m2. The goal is to treat her depression while also addressing her low weight. 

Mirtazapine is an antidepressant that is known to cause weight gain and increase appetite, making it a suitable choice for this patient who is underweight and desires to gain weight. It also helps with insomnia, which is another symptom she is experiencing.

Lithium is primarily used for bipolar disorder and does not specifically address weight gain. Olanzapine is an antipsychotic that can cause weight gain but is not primarily used for depression. Phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) used for depression but does not specifically promote weight gain.

Therefore, mirtazapine is the best choice to address both the mood disorder and the desire to gain weight.",9
3200,"The 6-year-old girl presents with signs of precocious puberty, including breast development and pubic hair, along with advanced bone age. The GnRH stimulation test shows an increase in LH, indicating central precocious puberty (CPP). In CPP, the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is activated early. The most common cause of CPP is idiopathic, but it is important to rule out central nervous system lesions, such as hypothalamic or pituitary tumors. An MRI of the brain is the appropriate next step to evaluate for any CNS abnormalities that could be causing the early activation of puberty.",9
3199,"The newborn presents with microcephaly, chorioretinitis, and diffuse intracranial calcifications, which are classic signs of congenital toxoplasmosis. The mother's history of low-grade fever and swollen lymph nodes during early pregnancy is consistent with a primary Toxoplasma gondii infection. Toxoplasmosis is often contracted through ingestion of undercooked or raw meat, particularly pork, or through contact with cat feces. Avoiding undercooked pork during pregnancy could have prevented the infection. The other options are less likely to be related to the symptoms presented: exposure to unvaccinated children is more related to viral infections like rubella, unprotected sexual intercourse is related to sexually transmitted infections, and mosquito bites are related to infections like Zika virus, which also causes microcephaly but not the specific findings seen here.",9
3196,"The patient has ingested a potentially toxic dose of acetaminophen (25 pills x 500 mg = 12,500 mg or 12.5 g). The ingestion occurred 1 hour prior to arrival, which is within the window where activated charcoal can be effective in reducing absorption of the drug from the gastrointestinal tract. The patient's liver function tests are currently normal, but acetaminophen toxicity can lead to delayed liver damage. Administering activated charcoal is appropriate to prevent further absorption of acetaminophen, especially since it is within 4 hours of ingestion. Other options like liver transplant or biopsy are not appropriate at this stage, and observation alone without intervention could lead to worsening outcomes.",9
3207,"The patient presents with a thyroid nodule that has concerning features on ultrasound, such as microcalcifications and irregular margins, which are suggestive of malignancy. The most appropriate next step in the evaluation of a thyroid nodule with these characteristics is to perform a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy to obtain a tissue sample for cytological examination. However, FNA is not listed as an option. Before proceeding with FNA, it is standard practice to assess thyroid function with a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level. If the TSH is suppressed, a thyroid scintigraphy might be considered to evaluate for a hyperfunctioning nodule, but in this case, the ultrasound findings are more suggestive of malignancy, making TSH the most appropriate next step to guide further management.",9
3206,"The symptoms described in the vignette suggest substance abuse, particularly involving episodic mood swings, slurred speech, irritability, decreased appetite, red eyes, and poor academic performance. The key detail is the eczematous rash between the upper lip and nostrils, which is indicative of inhalant use. Inhalants can cause a rash around the nose and mouth due to irritation from the chemicals. The neurological symptoms, such as delayed alternating palm movements, also align with inhalant use, which can cause neurological impairment. The short duration of the episodes (approximately 15 minutes) is consistent with the effects of inhalants, which are typically short-lived. Other options like alcohol, phencyclidine, and marijuana do not typically cause a rash around the nose and mouth.",9
3205,"In considering contraindications for combined oral contraceptive pills, smoking is a significant factor, especially in women over 35 years old. This patient is 37 years old and smokes 1 pack of cigarettes daily, which increases her risk of cardiovascular events such as thromboembolism, stroke, and myocardial infarction. This makes smoking a contraindication for the use of combined oral contraceptives in women over 35. 

Recurrent migraine headaches without aura are not a contraindication for combined oral contraceptives; however, migraines with aura would be. A history of cervical dysplasia is not a contraindication for combined oral contraceptives. Breastfeeding is not a contraindication, although it may affect milk supply, and progestin-only pills are often recommended instead.

Therefore, the most significant contraindication in this scenario is her smoking status.",9
3209,"The patient presents with knee pain that worsens with activity, crepitus, and limited range of motion, which are indicative of osteoarthritis. Her obesity (BMI of 36 kg/m2) is a significant risk factor for osteoarthritis, particularly in weight-bearing joints like the knee. The x-ray likely shows changes consistent with osteoarthritis, such as joint space narrowing or osteophyte formation. While intraarticular glucocorticoid injections can provide temporary relief, they do not address the underlying issue. Total joint replacement is considered for severe cases where conservative management fails. Colchicine is used for gout, which is not indicated here. The most appropriate initial management step for osteoarthritis, especially in the context of obesity, is a weight loss program to reduce joint stress and improve symptoms.",9
3211,"The question describes a process where there is an increase in the size of cells with an increase in cytoplasm, but the nuclei remain uniform in size. This is characteristic of hypertrophy, where cells increase in size rather than number. 

- Option A: Uterine myometrium in pregnancy undergoes hypertrophy due to increased demand and hormonal stimulation, leading to an increase in cell size.
- Option B: Liver following partial resection undergoes hyperplasia, where there is an increase in the number of cells, not size.
- Option C: Ovaries following menopause undergo atrophy, where there is a decrease in cell size and number.
- Option D: Cervix with chronic inflammation may show metaplasia or hyperplasia, but not hypertrophy.

The correct process that matches the description is hypertrophy, as seen in the uterine myometrium during pregnancy.",9
3212,"The patient has a long history of frequent urination without any identifiable medical cause, despite extensive testing. He is preoccupied with his symptoms, which have significantly impacted his life, leading to quitting his job and avoiding social events. His mental status examination shows a depressed mood and constricted affect, but no suicidal ideation. Malingering (A) is unlikely because there is no apparent external incentive. Atypical depression (B) typically involves mood reactivity and other specific symptoms, which are not described here. Adjustment disorder (D) involves a reaction to a specific stressor, which is not evident in this case. Somatic symptom disorder (C) involves excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to somatic symptoms, which fits this patient's presentation of being preoccupied with his symptoms and seeking extensive medical evaluation.",9
3204,"The patient presents with microcytic anemia (low hemoglobin and low mean corpuscular volume). The lab findings show low serum iron, low total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and high ferritin levels. These findings are consistent with anemia of chronic disease (also known as anemia of chronic inflammation). In this condition, ferritin is elevated because it is an acute phase reactant, and iron is sequestered in storage sites, leading to low serum iron and low TIBC. This pattern is distinct from iron deficiency anemia, which would show low ferritin and high TIBC. Therefore, the cause of the abnormal lab values is chronic inflammation.",9
3225,"The clinical presentation of the 4-year-old boy includes fever, severe pain in the lower extremities, difficulty eating, and irritability. The key findings on examination are flesh-colored, tender papules over the trunk, knees, palms, and soles, along with reddish macules on the hard palate. This presentation is characteristic of hand, foot, and mouth disease, which is commonly caused by Coxsackie A virus. The involvement of the palms and soles, along with oral lesions, aligns with this diagnosis. Other options like Human herpesvirus 6 (roseola), Rubella virus, and Herpes simplex virus 1 do not typically present with this combination of symptoms and lesion distribution.",9
3228,"The patient presents with anemia, black tarry stools (melena), and a history of end-stage renal disease and aortic stenosis. The melena suggests upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The anemia is microcytic, which is consistent with iron deficiency anemia, often due to chronic blood loss. In patients with aortic stenosis, there is an association with angiodysplasia, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, due to the acquired von Willebrand factor deficiency caused by the turbulent blood flow through the stenotic valve. Angiodysplasia can cause intermittent bleeding, leading to melena and anemia. The patient's hypotension and orthostasis suggest significant blood loss. Ischemic colitis typically presents with lower abdominal pain and hematochezia, not melena. Portal hypertension is associated with variceal bleeding, but this patient has no history of liver disease. Colonic polyps usually cause hematochezia rather than melena. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is angiodysplasia.",9
3234,"The patient is experiencing symptoms consistent with sundowning, a common phenomenon in Alzheimer's disease where confusion and agitation worsen in the late afternoon and evening. Non-pharmacological interventions are preferred initially to manage these symptoms. Establishing a regular sleep schedule can help regulate the patient's circadian rhythm and reduce nighttime agitation. Pharmacological interventions like quetiapine or lorazepam are generally avoided initially due to potential side effects and the risk of worsening confusion. Playing classical music may have some calming effects but is not as directly impactful as a structured sleep schedule.",9
3236,"The patient presents with classic symptoms of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), including crushing chest pain radiating to the jaw, diaphoresis, and distress. His risk factors include smoking and hypercholesterolemia. The ECG, although not visible here, is likely showing changes indicative of a myocardial infarction, such as ST-segment elevation, given the urgency of the question. In the setting of a suspected ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the best next step is to restore coronary blood flow as quickly as possible. Urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the preferred method for reperfusion therapy in STEMI if it can be performed in a timely manner. Therefore, the best next step is to proceed with urgent PCI.",9
3249,"The patient presents with acute onset of severe leg pain, tingling, and decreased pulses in the left leg, which are indicative of acute limb ischemia. His history of claudication, poorly controlled diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking are risk factors for peripheral artery disease. The coolness of the leg and decreased pulses suggest an arterial occlusion. To confirm the diagnosis of acute limb ischemia, imaging of the arterial system is necessary. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is the gold standard for visualizing blood flow and identifying occlusions in the arteries, making it the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis in this scenario.",9
3252,"The patient has a volar dislocation of the lunate bone, which is a type of carpal dislocation. This condition can lead to compression of the median nerve within the carpal tunnel. The median nerve provides sensation to the volar aspect of the first three fingers and the lateral half of the fourth finger. Compression of the median nerve can lead to paresthesia (tingling or numbness) in these areas, especially when the wrist is flexed, as this position can further compress the nerve. Therefore, the most likely finding on further evaluation would be paresthesia over the volar aspect of the first three fingers on wrist flexion.",9
3253,"The question describes a drug that increases serum renin, angiotensin I, and angiotensin II levels, and decreases serum aldosterone levels, without affecting bradykinin levels. 

- Candesartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). ARBs block the angiotensin II receptor, leading to increased levels of angiotensin II and renin due to feedback mechanisms, but they do not affect bradykinin levels. They also decrease aldosterone levels.

- Aliskiren is a direct renin inhibitor. It decreases renin activity, leading to decreased levels of angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and aldosterone. It does not fit the profile described.

- Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor. It increases bradykinin levels because it inhibits the breakdown of bradykinin. It also increases renin and angiotensin I levels but decreases angiotensin II and aldosterone levels.

- Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic that affects sodium channels in the distal nephron and does not directly affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

The drug that fits the description of increasing renin, angiotensin I, and angiotensin II levels, decreasing aldosterone, and not affecting bradykinin is Candesartan, an ARB.",9
3255,"The infant presents with fever, cough, nasal congestion, poor feeding, and respiratory distress, including wheezing and retractions. These symptoms are consistent with a viral lower respiratory tract infection. The age of the infant (6 weeks) and the presence of wheezing and respiratory distress suggest bronchiolitis, which is most commonly caused by Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in this age group. RSV is a common cause of bronchiolitis in infants and typically presents with these symptoms. The other organisms listed are less likely to cause this specific presentation in a 6-week-old infant.",9
3259,"The patient presents with renal impairment (elevated creatinine and BUN) and a history of lithium use. Lithium can cause nephrotoxicity, leading to chronic kidney disease. The smooth skin and swelling could be related to scleroderma-like changes, which can also be associated with renal issues. The best next step is to address the potential nephrotoxic agent, which is lithium in this case. Discontinuing lithium and starting an alternative mood stabilizer like valproic acid would be appropriate to prevent further renal damage.",9
3263,"The patient is a 71-year-old woman with a significant smoking history, presenting with a cough, weight loss, and hypercalcemia (serum calcium of 12.5 mg/dL). These symptoms are concerning for a malignancy, particularly lung cancer, given her smoking history. Hypercalcemia in the context of lung cancer is often due to paraneoplastic production of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), which is commonly associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. The wheezing and weight loss further support the possibility of a lung malignancy. Lobar pneumonia and tuberculosis are less likely to cause hypercalcemia, and sarcoidosis, while it can cause hypercalcemia, is less likely given the patient's smoking history and presentation.",9
3270,"The biopsy specimen shows proliferation of clustered, cuboidal, foamy-appearing cells in the lung parenchyma. These cells are likely type II pneumocytes, which are responsible for producing surfactant, a substance rich in lecithin (phosphatidylcholine). Surfactant reduces surface tension in the alveoli, preventing collapse and aiding in lung function. The description of the cells as 'foamy' is consistent with the appearance of type II pneumocytes due to their surfactant production. Therefore, the function associated with these cells is lecithin production.",9
3266,"The clinical presentation suggests a child with sickle cell disease, as indicated by the sickled red blood cells on the peripheral smear. Children with sickle cell disease are at increased risk for infections due to functional asplenia, particularly from encapsulated organisms. The symptoms of high fever, productive cough, and respiratory distress suggest a bacterial pneumonia. Among the options, Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of pneumonia in children with sickle cell disease due to their increased susceptibility to encapsulated bacteria. The presence of confusion and lethargy could indicate severe infection or sepsis, which is consistent with pneumococcal infection in this population.",9
3264,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a hematological disorder. The recurrent joint pain, fever, weight loss, pallor, petechiae, bruising, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy are indicative of a systemic condition affecting the blood and bone marrow. The CBC shows severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis, which are characteristic of a proliferative disorder of the bone marrow. Acute leukemia, particularly acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), is common in children and presents with these symptoms and lab findings. Tuberculosis of the bone marrow is less likely given the presentation and age. Aplastic anemia would present with pancytopenia but not leukocytosis. Chronic leukemia is less common in children and typically presents with a more indolent course.",9
3287,"The patient's symptoms and signs suggest intoxication with a substance that causes sympathetic stimulation. The elevated pulse and blood pressure, along with dry mucous membranes and conjunctival injection, are consistent with stimulant use, such as cocaine or amphetamines. These substances typically cause anxiety, increased heart rate, and elevated blood pressure. They also cause mydriasis (pupil dilation), not constriction, and can lead to impaired reaction time due to overstimulation of the central nervous system. Respiratory depression is more associated with opioid or sedative use, and decreased appetite is not a typical acute effect of stimulants. Therefore, impaired reaction time is the most likely finding in this scenario.",9
3279,"The patient's symptoms and history are indicative of a progressive cognitive decline, which is characteristic of dementia. She has memory deficits, difficulty with orientation, impaired executive function (as evidenced by errors in serial sevens and clock drawing), and word-finding difficulties. These symptoms have developed gradually over two years, which is typical for Alzheimer disease. Normal pressure hydrocephalus would present with a triad of symptoms including gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and dementia, but the gait disturbance is usually more prominent early on. Frontotemporal dementia typically presents with personality changes and language difficulties, but not the memory deficits seen here. Creutzfeld-Jakob disease is a rapidly progressive dementia with myoclonus and other neurological signs, which does not fit the gradual progression in this case. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Alzheimer disease.",9
3288,"The patient has elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The best therapy for lowering LDL cholesterol is a statin. Statins are known to have several potential side effects, including muscle-related symptoms and hepatotoxicity. Among the options provided, hepatotoxicity is a known side effect of statins. Gastrointestinal upset is more commonly associated with other lipid-lowering agents like bile acid sequestrants. Malabsorption is not typically associated with statins, and pruritus is not a common side effect of statins either.",9
3290,"During exercise, several physiological changes occur to meet the increased oxygen demands of the body. One of these changes is a decrease in physiologic dead space. This is because exercise increases tidal volume and ventilation-perfusion matching, reducing the proportion of each breath that does not participate in gas exchange. Pulmonary vascular resistance typically decreases due to recruitment and distension of pulmonary capillaries, not increases. The alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient may increase slightly due to increased cardiac output and ventilation-perfusion mismatch, not decrease. Arterial partial pressure of oxygen usually remains stable or slightly decreases due to increased oxygen extraction by tissues, not increase.",9
3297,"The question describes a type of asthma associated with eosinophils, which are known to release substances that can cause damage to the bronchial epithelium. Eosinophils are white blood cells that play a key role in allergic reactions and asthma. Among the substances released by eosinophils, major basic protein (MBP) is known to cause damage to the bronchial epithelium. IL-5 is a cytokine that promotes the growth and activation of eosinophils but does not directly cause epithelial damage. IgM is an antibody and not directly involved in causing epithelial damage in asthma. Interferon-gamma is a cytokine involved in immune responses but not specifically in eosinophil-mediated epithelial damage. Therefore, the correct answer is major basic protein, which is released by eosinophils and causes bronchial epithelial damage.",9
3296,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), including joint pain, morning stiffness, and positive anti-citrullinated protein antibodies. The elevated ESR and CRP indicate inflammation. Initial treatment for RA typically involves disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to slow disease progression. Methotrexate is the first-line DMARD for RA due to its efficacy and safety profile. Hydroxychloroquine is used for milder cases or in combination with other DMARDs, while infliximab is a biologic agent used for more severe or refractory cases. Ibuprofen is an NSAID that provides symptomatic relief but does not modify disease progression. Given the patient's symptoms and the need to address the underlying disease, methotrexate is the most appropriate initial treatment.",9
3298,"The patient's symptoms and occupational exposure suggest a zoonotic infection. He is a farmer with exposure to various animals, including rabbits, which are a known reservoir for Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia. The presentation of fever, chills, cough, and pleural effusion, along with a tender lymph node, aligns with tularemia, particularly the pneumonic form. The negative Gram stain and serology are consistent with tularemia, as it is difficult to culture and requires specific serological tests. Bacillus anthracis (anthrax) and Yersinia pestis (plague) are less likely given the presentation and lack of specific exposure history. Staphylococcus aureus typically causes different types of infections and would likely show up on a Gram stain. Therefore, the most likely causative organism is Francisella tularensis.",9
3301,"The patient is a 17-year-old boy who has been increasingly withdrawn over the last 2-3 years. He prefers being alone, has no friends, and shows indifference to his mother's emotional distress. His affect is flattened, but his thought process is organized and logical. These features suggest a personality disorder characterized by detachment from social relationships and a restricted range of emotional expression. Schizoid personality disorder is characterized by a preference for solitary activities, emotional coldness, and indifference to praise or criticism. The patient's behavior aligns with these traits. Schizophreniform disorder would involve more severe symptoms like hallucinations or delusions, which are not present here. Antisocial personality disorder involves a disregard for the rights of others, which is not indicated. Avoidant personality disorder involves a desire for social interaction but fear of rejection, which is not the case here as the patient prefers solitude.",9
3304,"The clinical presentation of the patient, including sore throat, fever, and cervical lymphadenopathy, along with tonsillar exudates, suggests a bacterial pharyngitis, likely caused by Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes). The key feature in the question is the organism's ability to withstand phagocytosis. Streptococcus pyogenes is known for its virulence factor, M protein, which inhibits phagocytosis by interfering with opsonization. This is the most likely explanation for the organism's ability to resist phagocytosis in fresh blood.",9
3309,"In a case-control study, recall bias is a common issue where participants may remember past events differently based on their current health status. Mothers of infants with myelomeningocele might be more likely to recall and report illnesses during pregnancy, such as pharyngitis, compared to mothers of healthy infants. This differential recall can lead to an apparent association that may not truly exist. Surveillance bias involves more frequent monitoring of one group, assessment bias involves systematic errors in measurement, and Neyman bias (prevalence-incidence bias) involves selective survival affecting study results. In this scenario, recall bias is the most likely issue affecting the study's validity.",9
3306,"The clinical presentation of the 4-year-old boy suggests a diagnosis of abetalipoproteinemia. This condition is characterized by a very low serum cholesterol level, acanthocytosis (red blood cells with spiny projections), and symptoms such as muscle weakness, ataxia, and vision problems due to vitamin E deficiency. The persistent diarrhea and low-fat diet are consistent with fat malabsorption. In abetalipoproteinemia, there is a defect in the formation of chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) due to a mutation in the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). This leads to the accumulation of lipids in enterocytes after meals, as they cannot be properly exported into the lymphatic system. Therefore, further evaluation would show post-prandial lipid-laden enterocytes.",9
3308,"The patient presents with episodes of severe right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, and mild scleral icterus, which suggests a biliary obstruction. The laboratory findings show elevated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT, indicating a hepatobiliary issue. The ultrasound shows a dilated common bile duct and gallstones, but no gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid, which rules out acute cholecystitis. The dilation of the common bile duct suggests an obstruction, likely due to a stone (choledocholithiasis). The absence of fever and leukocytosis makes cholangitis less likely. The history of terminal ileum resection for Crohn's disease increases the risk of gallstone formation due to altered bile salt metabolism. Acute hepatitis A would not cause a dilated bile duct, and pancreatitis would present with different symptoms and findings. Therefore, the most likely cause is choledocholithiasis.",9
3310,"The patient is experiencing symptoms consistent with urge incontinence, characterized by a sudden and intense urge to urinate followed by involuntary loss of urine. This is often due to overactive bladder. The urinalysis is unremarkable, ruling out infection. The best initial management for urge incontinence is non-pharmacological, focusing on behavioral therapies such as bladder training. This involves scheduled voiding and gradually increasing the intervals between voids to improve bladder control. Antimuscarinics are typically considered if behavioral interventions are ineffective.",9
3316,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with acute gout, characterized by sudden onset of pain, redness, and swelling in the great toe. His history of a similar episode that responded to indomethacin, along with risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, alcohol abuse, and use of hydrochlorothiazide, supports this diagnosis. The new medication given to the patient decreases leukocyte migration and mitosis, which is characteristic of colchicine. Colchicine works by inhibiting microtubule polymerization, thereby preventing neutrophil chemotaxis and activity, which reduces inflammation in gout. The side effects of nausea and vomiting are also consistent with colchicine use. Therefore, the mechanism of action of the new medication is inhibition of microtubule polymerization.",9
3327,"The clinical presentation of the child suggests rickets, which is characterized by delayed growth, weakness, bowing of the legs, and a protruded abdomen. The subcostal grooving and wrist changes are also indicative of rickets. Rickets is commonly caused by vitamin D deficiency, especially in children with inadequate nutrition and limited sun exposure, which is consistent with the child's history as a refugee with inadequate nutrition and housing. Vitamin D is essential for calcium and phosphate metabolism, and its deficiency leads to poor bone mineralization, resulting in the symptoms observed.",9
3319,"The patient has a deficiency in CD40 ligand on T-cells, which is characteristic of Hyper-IgM syndrome. CD40 ligand is crucial for class switching in B-cells. Without CD40 ligand, B-cells cannot switch from producing IgM to other types of immunoglobulins like IgG, IgA, or IgE. As a result, IgM levels are elevated because it is the default antibody produced by B-cells. Therefore, the immunoglobulin likely to be present in excess is IgM.",9
3330,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of intussusception, which is characterized by intermittent abdominal pain, vomiting, and the ultrasound finding of concentric rings (""target sign""). In children, the most common lead point for intussusception is a Meckel diverticulum. The history of a similar episode 3 months ago and the current presentation with nonbilious vomiting and abdominal pain support this diagnosis. Other options like intestinal adhesions, acute appendicitis, and malrotation with volvulus are less likely given the specific ultrasound findings and the episodic nature of the symptoms.",9
3335,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of secondary polycythemia, likely due to chronic hypoxia from smoking and chronic bronchitis. The elevated erythrocyte count and hemoglobin level indicate polycythemia. The low ferritin and iron levels suggest iron deficiency, possibly due to increased red blood cell production. The bluish discoloration of the lips and facial flushing are consistent with hypoxia. The most immediate concern is to reduce the risk of complications from increased blood viscosity due to high hematocrit levels. Phlebotomy is the treatment of choice to reduce hematocrit and improve symptoms in cases of secondary polycythemia due to hypoxia.",9
3343,"The question asks for a medication that acts on the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope glycoprotein. Gp41 is involved in the fusion of the HIV virus with the host cell membrane. Enfuvirtide is a fusion inhibitor that specifically targets the gp41 subunit, preventing the virus from entering the host cell. 

- Amantadine is an antiviral that inhibits the M2 protein of influenza A, not related to HIV.
- Zidovudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) used in HIV treatment but does not target gp41.
- Saquinavir is a protease inhibitor used in HIV treatment but acts on the viral protease, not gp41.

Therefore, the correct answer is Enfuvirtide, which acts on gp41.",10
3328,"The patient's presentation includes a long-standing history of anemia, neonatal jaundice, recurrent jaundice episodes, pallor, scleral icterus, and splenomegaly. The peripheral blood smear shows red cell basophilic stippling. These findings suggest a hemolytic anemia with extravascular hemolysis, likely due to a red blood cell enzyme deficiency. 

- Pyruvate kinase deficiency (A) typically presents with hemolytic anemia and splenomegaly, but basophilic stippling is not a characteristic finding.
- Cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency (B) is associated with methemoglobinemia, not hemolytic anemia with basophilic stippling.
- Lead poisoning (C) can cause basophilic stippling, but the clinical presentation here is more consistent with a congenital hemolytic anemia rather than lead poisoning.
- Pyrimidine 5’-nucleotidase deficiency (D) is a rare cause of hemolytic anemia that is specifically associated with basophilic stippling due to the accumulation of pyrimidine nucleotides.

Given the combination of basophilic stippling and the clinical presentation, pyrimidine 5’-nucleotidase deficiency is the most likely diagnosis.",9
3311,"The patient has a history of breast cancer and is on pain management post-mastectomy. She reports using less heroin since starting the prescribed pain medication, and her toxicology screen confirms reduced heroin use. This suggests that the analgesic is providing adequate opioid receptor activation, reducing her need for heroin. Given her history of heroin use, a medication that could both manage pain and reduce opioid use is likely being used. A mixed agonist-antagonist at opioid receptors, such as buprenorphine, fits this scenario as it can provide analgesia while also reducing opioid cravings and use. A pure agonist at the µ-opioid receptor would likely increase opioid use rather than decrease it. Therefore, the analgesic drug she was most likely prescribed is one that acts as a mixed agonist-antagonist at opioid receptors.",9
3357,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with a stroke, likely an embolic event given the sudden onset and the presence of an irregularly irregular rhythm, suggestive of atrial fibrillation. The neurological deficits include right-sided hemiparesis, facial droop, and slurred speech, indicating involvement of the left hemisphere of the brain. The middle cerebral artery (MCA) supplies the lateral aspect of the cerebral hemisphere, which includes areas responsible for motor control and sensation of the face and upper extremities, as well as language centers in the dominant hemisphere (usually the left). The facial droop with preserved ability to elevate eyebrows suggests an upper motor neuron lesion, consistent with an MCA stroke. Therefore, the angiography is most likely to show a lesion in the left middle cerebral artery.",9
3370,"The patient is a 17-year-old girl with a BMI of 16.1 kg/m2, which is significantly underweight. She also has secondary amenorrhea (absence of menstruation for 4 months) and physical signs such as pale skin and thin, soft body hair, which suggest malnutrition or an eating disorder like anorexia nervosa. In such conditions, there is often a deficiency in essential nutrients, including calcium and vitamin D, leading to decreased bone mineral density. This increases the risk of osteoporosis and fractures. The other options are less likely: hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia are not typically associated with anorexia nervosa, and hyperthyroidism would present with different symptoms.",9
3374,"The patient's symptoms of diarrhea, bloating, nausea, vomiting, and greasy stools, along with the history of drinking fresh water from a stream, suggest a parasitic infection, likely Giardia lamblia. The presence of cysts in the stool microscopy supports this diagnosis. Giardia is commonly acquired from contaminated water sources, such as streams, and causes malabsorption leading to steatorrhea (greasy stools). The most appropriate treatment for giardiasis is metronidazole, which is effective against Giardia lamblia. Octreotide is used for conditions like carcinoid syndrome, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is used for bacterial infections and some protozoal infections like Pneumocystis jirovecii, and supportive treatment alone would not address the underlying infection.",9
3371,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with heart failure, including difficulty breathing, orthopnea, and lower limb edema. His history of myocardial infarction and current medications, including a diuretic (furosemide), support this diagnosis. The laboratory results show elevated BUN and creatinine, indicating possible renal impairment, likely due to decreased perfusion from heart failure. The blood pressure is on the lower side, but not critically low, suggesting that the primary issue is fluid overload rather than hypotension. The most appropriate therapy in this context is to address the fluid overload, which is contributing to the pulmonary congestion and edema. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is effective in reducing fluid overload in heart failure patients by promoting diuresis. Therefore, the most appropriate therapy is to administer furosemide.",9
3376,"Testicular cancer typically spreads via lymphatic channels. The primary lymphatic drainage of the testes is to the para-aortic (retroperitoneal) lymph nodes. This is because the testes originate embryologically in the abdomen and descend into the scrotum, maintaining their original lymphatic drainage. In this case, the patient has a testicular tumor with lymphatic invasion, so the most likely site for metastatic spread would be the para-aortic lymph nodes.",9
3379,"The patient is a 25-year-old pregnant woman at 34 weeks' gestation with generalized pruritus and mild scleral icterus. Her laboratory results show elevated total and direct bilirubin, elevated bile acids, and mildly elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT). The elevated bile acids and pruritus are key indicators of cholestasis of pregnancy, a condition characterized by impaired bile flow during pregnancy, leading to increased bile acids in the blood. The normal platelet count and lack of hemolysis or elevated liver enzymes to the degree seen in HELLP syndrome make HELLP unlikely. Viral hepatitis A would typically present with more significant liver enzyme elevation and systemic symptoms. Gilbert syndrome usually presents with isolated indirect hyperbilirubinemia, not direct hyperbilirubinemia or elevated bile acids. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is cholestasis of pregnancy.",9
3378,"The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with a varicocele, which is characterized by a ""bag of worms"" feeling in the scrotum and does not transilluminate. Varicoceles are more common on the left side because the left testicular vein drains into the left renal vein, which then drains into the inferior vena cava. This drainage pattern can lead to increased pressure in the left testicular vein, making varicoceles more common on the left side.",9
3381,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of a myeloproliferative disorder. The key findings include splenomegaly, teardrop-shaped RBCs, nucleated RBCs, immature myeloid cells, and a positive JAK-2 mutation. The negative TRAP test and absence of the Philadelphia chromosome (negative for translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22) rule out hairy cell leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia, respectively. The presence of a JAK-2 mutation and the difficulty in aspirating the marrow (dry tap) suggest primary myelofibrosis. In primary myelofibrosis, the only potentially curative treatment is allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.",9
3382,"The patient presents with dyspnea, hemoptysis, and pulmonary infiltrates, along with renal involvement indicated by proteinuria and hematuria. This combination of pulmonary and renal symptoms suggests a condition that affects both the lungs and kidneys. The presence of hemoptysis and renal involvement is characteristic of Goodpasture's syndrome, which is associated with anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies. Other conditions such as lupus (anti-dsDNA) or membranous nephropathy (anti-PLA2R) do not typically present with this combination of symptoms. P-ANCA is associated with vasculitis, but the presentation here is more classic for Goodpasture's syndrome.",9
3384,"The patient presents with hypotension, muffled heart sounds, and jugular venous distention, which are classic signs of cardiac tamponade, often referred to as Beck's triad. In the context of a stab wound to the chest, cardiac tamponade is a likely complication due to potential injury to the heart or pericardium. One of the hallmark signs of cardiac tamponade is pulsus paradoxus, which is an exaggerated decrease in systolic blood pressure during inspiration. This occurs because the increased venous return to the right side of the heart during inspiration further compresses the left side of the heart in the setting of tamponade, reducing left ventricular filling and thus decreasing systolic blood pressure. Therefore, the finding most consistent with cardiac tamponade in this scenario is a decrease in systolic blood pressure during inspiration.",9
3387,"The patient's presentation is consistent with Lyme disease, which is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted by tick bites. The key features include the characteristic erythema migrans rash (bulls-eye appearance), fever, arthralgias, and history of potential tick exposure. The standard treatment for Lyme disease in adults is doxycycline; however, this patient has a history of anaphylaxis to tetracyclines, which includes doxycycline. Therefore, an alternative antibiotic must be chosen. Amoxicillin is a recommended alternative for treating Lyme disease in patients who cannot take doxycycline. Cephalexin is not typically used for Lyme disease, and macrolides like azithromycin and erythromycin are less effective. Thus, the physician would prescribe amoxicillin.",9
3390,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), including morning stiffness, symmetrical joint swelling, and a positive rheumatoid factor. The early-morning neck pain raises concern for cervical spine involvement, particularly atlantoaxial subluxation, which can occur in RA. An X-ray of the cervical spine is important to assess for any cervical spine instability or subluxation, especially before any surgical procedures or intubation. Measurement of anti-Smith antibodies is more relevant for diagnosing systemic lupus erythematosus, which is not the primary concern here. A CT scan of the chest and a tuberculin skin test are not directly relevant to the current presentation. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is an X-ray of the cervical spine to evaluate for potential cervical spine involvement.",9
3398,"Influenza virus primarily affects the respiratory epithelium, leading to damage and necrosis of the epithelial cells. During the recovery phase, there is regeneration and repair of the damaged lung tissue. Type II pneumocytes are responsible for the production of surfactant and also serve as progenitor cells for the regeneration of the alveolar epithelium. In response to injury, there is an increase in type II pneumocytes as they proliferate to replace the damaged type I pneumocytes and restore the alveolar lining. Therefore, in patients recovering from influenza pneumonia, an increase in type II pneumocytes is expected on histopathologic examination.",9
3400,"The infant is showing signs of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), which occurs due to withdrawal from substances the mother used during pregnancy. The symptoms include irritability, high-pitched crying, sweating, and nasal congestion. The most common cause of NAS is opioid withdrawal. The appropriate pharmacological treatment for opioid withdrawal in neonates is to use an opioid such as morphine to manage the withdrawal symptoms.",9
3394,"The patient presents with leukocytosis, splenomegaly, and a history of smoking. The leukocyte count is significantly elevated at 34,000/mm3, which suggests a myeloproliferative disorder. The pending cytogenetic testing is likely to check for the Philadelphia chromosome, which is associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In CML, a characteristic finding is a low leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) score due to the presence of immature granulocytes. The other options are less consistent with CML: decreased basophil count is not typical (CML often shows increased basophils), autoimmune hemolytic anemia is not a primary feature of CML, and elevated serum β2 microglobulin is more associated with lymphoproliferative disorders like multiple myeloma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",9
3388,"The clinical presentation suggests a foreign body aspiration, particularly given the acute onset of cough and wheezing, the unilateral decreased breath sounds, and hyperlucency on the chest x-ray. The hyperlucency and decreased pulmonary markings on the right side indicate air trapping, which is consistent with a foreign body obstructing the airway. In this scenario, bronchoscopy is both diagnostic and therapeutic, as it allows for visualization and removal of the foreign body. Other options like albuterol nebulization would not address the underlying cause if a foreign body is present, and CT of the lung is not necessary given the clear indication for bronchoscopy. Azithromycin is not indicated as there is no evidence of bacterial infection.",9
3413,"The patient presents with irregular periods, weight gain, and acne, which are suggestive of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries. The patient's BMI of 30 kg/m^2 indicates obesity, which is common in PCOS. Her Hemoglobin A1c is normal, suggesting she does not have diabetes, but insulin resistance is often associated with PCOS. The best initial treatment for PCOS in women not seeking pregnancy is a combination oral contraceptive pill, which helps regulate menstrual cycles and reduce androgen levels, thereby improving acne and hirsutism. Ethinyl estradiol - norgestimate is a combination oral contraceptive that would be appropriate for this purpose.",9
3407,"The patient is a young male athlete with syncope, exertional chest pain, and a family history of sudden death, which are suggestive of a cardiac condition. The physical exam reveals a harsh crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur best heard at the apex and radiating to the axilla, along with an early diastolic murmur. The key finding is that the murmur becomes louder with the Valsalva maneuver, which is characteristic of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). HCM is often associated with a family history of sudden cardiac death due to its genetic nature. The echocardiogram would likely show asymmetric septal hypertrophy, confirming the diagnosis. Aortic stenosis typically presents with a murmur that radiates to the carotids and does not increase with Valsalva. Heart blocks would not present with these murmur characteristics. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.",9
3421,"The patient's symptoms of feeling burned out, irritability, anxiety, and sleep difficulties are directly related to his stressful work environment as a surgical resident. These symptoms have improved with changes in his work conditions, suggesting a situational cause. Adjustment disorder is characterized by emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor, which resolve once the stressor is removed or the individual adapts. The improvement in symptoms with a more manageable workload supports this diagnosis. Generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder are less likely because they are not typically situational and would not resolve simply with changes in workload. Anxiety disorder is too vague and not a specific diagnosis.",9
3416,"The patient has been started on treatment for latent tuberculosis, which typically involves isoniazid (INH). The laboratory findings show anemia and elevated liver enzymes, which are known side effects of isoniazid. Additionally, the Prussian blue stain is used to detect iron, suggesting sideroblastic anemia, a known side effect of isoniazid due to its interference with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) metabolism. Isoniazid works by inhibiting the synthesis of mycolic acids, which are essential components of the mycobacterial cell wall.",9
3419,"The patient has been suffering from major depressive disorder and has not responded to multiple trials of antidepressant medications, including fluoxetine and others, over the past year. He has now attempted suicide, indicating severe depression with suicidal ideation. In cases of treatment-resistant depression, especially with acute suicidal risk, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is considered a highly effective treatment option. ECT can provide rapid improvement in mood and is often used when there is an urgent need to address severe symptoms, such as suicidal behavior. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a useful treatment for depression but is not the immediate choice in an acute suicidal situation. Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant, which is not typically used in acute situations due to its side effect profile and overdose risk. Olanzapine is an antipsychotic that might be used as an adjunct in treatment-resistant depression but is not the primary choice in this scenario. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for this patient, given the severity and urgency of his condition, is electroconvulsive therapy.",9
3431,"The patient presents with amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and bitemporal hemianopsia. These symptoms suggest a prolactinoma, a type of pituitary adenoma that secretes prolactin. The amenorrhea and galactorrhea are due to elevated prolactin levels, which inhibit gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), leading to decreased estrogen and progesterone production. The bitemporal hemianopsia is due to compression of the optic chiasm by the pituitary tumor. An MRI of the brain is the most appropriate test to visualize the pituitary gland and confirm the presence of a pituitary adenoma.",9
3429,"The newborn presents with anemia, jaundice, and hepatosplenomegaly. The hemoglobin DNA testing shows 3 missing alleles, which is indicative of alpha-thalassemia. In alpha-thalassemia, the severity depends on the number of alpha-globin genes deleted. With 3 missing alleles, this condition is known as Hemoglobin H disease. In this condition, there is an excess of beta-globin chains that form tetramers called Hemoglobin H (HbH). Additionally, in the fetal period, the lack of alpha chains leads to the formation of gamma tetramers known as Hemoglobin Barts (γ4). Therefore, in a newborn with 3 missing alpha-globin alleles, there would be an increased concentration of Hemoglobin Barts.",9
3433,"The patient's symptoms of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue, along with a family history of similar symptoms leading to respiratory failure, suggest a hereditary condition. The pulmonary function tests show a normal FEV1/FVC ratio and normal diffusion capacity, which rules out obstructive or restrictive lung diseases. The ECG shows a right axis deviation, which can be associated with right heart strain. The genetic analysis reveals a mutation in the BMPR2 gene, which is known to be associated with familial pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). PAH leads to elevated pulmonary arterial pressure, causing right ventricular hypertrophy and strain, which can explain the right axis deviation on ECG. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is elevated pulmonary arterial pressure due to PAH.",9
3422,"The patient presents with a breast mass that is rubbery and movable, which is suggestive of lobular carcinoma rather than ductal carcinoma. Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is known for its potential to present bilaterally more often than invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). The patient's friend has invasive ductal carcinoma, which is the most common type of breast cancer. Invasive lobular carcinoma is less common than invasive ductal carcinoma, so option C (higher prevalence) is incorrect. Invasive lobular carcinoma can be more difficult to detect on mammograms, often not showing the typical spiculated mass seen in ductal carcinoma, making option D incorrect. The prognosis of lobular carcinoma is not necessarily worse than ductal carcinoma, so option A is incorrect. Therefore, the characteristic associated with lobular carcinoma compared to ductal carcinoma is that it can present bilaterally.",9
3375,,0
3448,"The patient's symptoms of irritability, rapid breathing, agitation, diaphoresis, fever, tachycardia, hypertension, and dilated pupils are consistent with stimulant use, particularly a sympathomimetic drug. The most likely drug causing these symptoms is methamphetamine, which is known to cause such adrenergic effects. Methamphetamine can be synthesized from pseudoephedrine, a common over-the-counter decongestant. The other options do not fit the profile of substances used to make methamphetamine or cause similar symptoms.",9
3441,"The patient's symptoms and lab findings suggest a hemolytic process. The combination of headache, blurry vision, abdominal pain, dark urine, and the lab findings of anemia, elevated reticulocyte count, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and elevated indirect bilirubin are indicative of hemolysis. The decreased flow in the right hepatic vein suggests Budd-Chiari syndrome, which can be associated with hypercoagulable states. Given the family history of sickle cell trait and the patient's symptoms, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) should be considered. PNH is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombosis, and pancytopenia. Flow cytometry is used to detect the absence of CD55 and CD59 on red blood cells, which is diagnostic for PNH. Therefore, flow cytometry would most likely identify the patient’s diagnosis.",9
3451,"The patient presents with tachypnea and a history of smoking, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The key findings from the pulmonary function testing are decreased tidal volume and normal lung compliance. 

- Emphysema exacerbation (A) would typically show increased lung compliance due to destruction of alveolar walls, not normal compliance.
- Tension pneumothorax (B) would cause decreased lung compliance due to air in the pleural space, and it would also present with hypotension and tracheal deviation, which are not mentioned here.
- Rib fracture (C) can cause pain leading to decreased tidal volume due to splinting and normal lung compliance, as the lung tissue itself is not affected.
- Pulmonary edema (D) would typically show decreased lung compliance due to fluid in the alveoli, which is not consistent with the normal compliance seen here.

Given the normal lung compliance and decreased tidal volume, the most likely cause of tachypnea is pain from a rib fracture, leading to shallow breathing and increased respiratory rate to compensate for decreased tidal volume.",9
3452,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest X-linked agammaglobulinemia (Bruton's agammaglobulinemia), characterized by recurrent bacterial infections, absent B cells, and normal T cells. This condition results from a defect in B cell maturation, leading to low or absent immunoglobulins. The immediate management for patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia is to provide passive immunity through intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) replacement therapy. This helps prevent infections by supplying the missing antibodies. Stem cell transplantation is a potential cure but is not the immediate next step. Recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and thymus transplantation are not relevant to this condition.",9
3450,"The clinical presentation described in the vignette is consistent with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The key features include delayed language development, lack of social interaction, repetitive behaviors, and sensitivity to sensory stimuli. Epidemiologically, ASD is known to be more common in boys than in girls. Specifically, it is approximately 4 times more common in boys. The other options do not have strong epidemiological associations with ASD. Therefore, the correct answer is the one that reflects the gender disparity in the prevalence of ASD.",9
3456,"The patient presents with diarrhea following recent antibiotic treatment, which raises suspicion for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), especially given his history of IV drug use and recent treatment for an abscess, likely with antibiotics. The symptoms of watery diarrhea and abdominal discomfort are consistent with CDI. The best initial treatment for mild to moderate CDI is oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin. Metronidazole is no longer recommended as first-line treatment for CDI. Clindamycin is not appropriate as it can cause CDI. Oral rehydration is supportive but does not address the underlying cause if CDI is suspected. Therefore, the best initial treatment is oral vancomycin.",9
3460,"The patient has a history of a pulmonary embolism and now presents with signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), indicated by the non-compressible popliteal vein on ultrasonography and elevated D-dimer levels. The insensitivity to activated protein C suggests a resistance to its anticoagulant effects, which is characteristic of Factor V Leiden mutation. This mutation involves a specific change in the factor V gene that makes it resistant to inactivation by activated protein C, leading to a hypercoagulable state. Given the patient's history and laboratory findings, the most likely underlying cause is a mutation of coagulation factor V, known as Factor V Leiden.",9
3461,"The patient presents with acute right-sided weakness, facial droop, and hyperreflexia, which are indicative of a stroke affecting the left side of the brain. Given his history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes, he is at risk for small vessel disease. Lipohyalinosis of penetrating vessels is a common cause of lacunar strokes, which often present with pure motor hemiparesis without sensory loss. The intact sensation and the presence of risk factors for small vessel disease make lipohyalinosis the most likely cause. Rupture of an intracranial aneurysm typically presents with a sudden severe headache and altered consciousness, which are not described here. Stenosis of the internal carotid artery and embolism from the left atrium usually cause larger cortical strokes, often with sensory deficits or aphasia, which are not present in this case.",9
3467,"The symptoms described in the vignette are characteristic of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The key features include inattention, lack of communication with parents and peers, preference for solitary play, repetitive behaviors (arranging toy cars in a line), and avoidance of eye contact. These behaviors align with the diagnostic criteria for ASD, which include deficits in social communication and interaction, as well as restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior. Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) typically involves defiant and hostile behavior towards authority figures, which is not the primary issue here. Conduct disorder involves more severe antisocial behaviors, which are not described. Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder that primarily affects females and involves regression of motor skills and language, which is not consistent with the presentation here. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Autism Spectrum Disorder.",9
3465,"The patient's symptoms and findings are suggestive of mitral stenosis, which is common in individuals from regions where rheumatic fever is prevalent, such as India. The key findings include an opening snap followed by a low-pitched diastolic murmur, which are characteristic of mitral stenosis. The irregular pulse and ECG findings of atrial fibrillation are also common in mitral stenosis due to left atrial enlargement. The accentuated and split S2, jugular venous distention, and pitting edema indicate pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart failure, secondary to increased pressure in the left atrium. The increased left atrial pressure is due to the obstruction of blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle caused by the stenotic mitral valve. This increased pressure leads to pulmonary congestion and the subsequent symptoms of shortness of breath and palpitations.",9
3477,"The patient's presentation is consistent with oral candidiasis, commonly known as thrush, which is characterized by white patches in the mouth that can be scraped off, leaving a red, raw surface underneath. This condition is often associated with the use of inhaled corticosteroids, as they can suppress local immune function in the oral cavity, allowing for fungal overgrowth. Beclomethasone is an inhaled corticosteroid used in the management of asthma, and it is known to cause oral thrush as a side effect if proper oral hygiene (such as rinsing the mouth after use) is not maintained. The other medications listed, such as albuterol (a short-acting beta-agonist), salmeterol (a long-acting beta-agonist), and omalizumab (an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody), are not typically associated with causing oral thrush.",9
3468,"The patient's symptoms and chest x-ray findings suggest emphysema, likely due to smoking. The increased activity of elastase indicates tissue destruction, which is characteristic of emphysema. Neutrophils are the primary source of elastase in the lungs. Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a potent chemotactic agent for neutrophils, attracting them to sites of inflammation. Therefore, the cells producing the elastase (neutrophils) were likely stimulated to enter the site of inflammation by LTB4.",9
3470,"The patient presents with symptoms of depression, including continuous sadness, lack of interest in activities, poor concentration, and changes in sleep and appetite. These symptoms have been present for a couple of weeks. Additionally, she describes a period a few months ago where she was very outgoing, had many plans, was easily distracted, had 'brilliant ideas,' and required little sleep. This suggests a hypomanic episode. In bipolar disorder type II, patients experience hypomanic episodes and major depressive episodes. In contrast, bipolar disorder type I involves full manic episodes. The absence of a full manic episode (characterized by more severe symptoms and often requiring hospitalization) and the presence of a hypomanic episode along with depressive episodes point towards bipolar disorder type II.",9
3487,"The patient is an 18-year-old male who experienced sudden loss of consciousness during physical activity, which is a classic presentation of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The echocardiography findings of left ventricular hypertrophy and increased thickness of the interventricular septum are characteristic of HCM. The most common cause of HCM is a genetic mutation, often in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene. This condition is known for causing sudden cardiac death in young athletes due to arrhythmias. Other options like drug abuse, viral infection, and autoimmunity are less likely to cause the specific echocardiographic findings and sudden cardiac events in this context.",9
3482,"The patient presents with sudden onset shortness of breath after exposure to chemicals, a history of smoking, and diminished breath sounds over the right upper lobe. The low oxygen saturation despite being on 100% oxygen suggests a problem with ventilation or perfusion. The diminished breath sounds and the acute nature of the symptoms point towards a pneumothorax, likely due to rupture of an emphysematous bleb, which is common in patients with a significant smoking history and possible underlying COPD. The presence of a systolic murmur and pitting edema could indicate underlying cardiac issues, but the acute presentation and specific lung findings are more consistent with a pneumothorax.",9
3486,"The patient has experienced significant physical stress due to trauma, burns, and surgery. In such situations, the body can respond with increased gastric acid production, leading to stress-related mucosal disease (SRMD). This condition can cause gastric mucosal disruption, resulting in bleeding. The hematemesis in this patient is likely due to stress ulcers, which are caused by both increased gastric acid production and gastric mucosal disruption. Fentanyl overuse is not typically associated with hematemesis. Therefore, the mechanism underlying the development of his hematemesis involves both gastric mucosal disruption and increased gastric acid production.",9
3488,"The patient presents with severe abdominal pain, hypotension, tachycardia, and a pulsatile abdominal mass, which are classic signs of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). This is a life-threatening emergency that requires immediate surgical intervention. The hypotension and tachycardia suggest hemodynamic instability, likely due to internal bleeding. In such cases, the most appropriate next step is to proceed directly to open emergency surgery to repair the aneurysm. Imaging studies or other diagnostic procedures would delay necessary treatment and are not appropriate in this acute setting.",10
3490,"The clinical presentation of the 5-month-old boy suggests a lysosomal storage disorder, specifically I-cell disease (mucolipidosis II). This condition is characterized by restricted joint movement, coarse facial features, hepatosplenomegaly, skeletal abnormalities, and elevated plasma lysosomal enzymes. I-cell disease is caused by a defect in the enzyme that adds mannose-6-phosphate to lysosomal enzymes in the Golgi apparatus. This defect prevents the enzymes from being properly targeted to the lysosomes, leading to their secretion into the plasma instead. Therefore, the production of mannose-6-phosphate is disrupted in this patient.",9
3491,"The patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest a granulomatous disease. The presence of a subpleural nodule and right hilar lymphadenopathy, along with granulomas with acellular cores, is indicative of a granulomatous infection. Primary tuberculosis is characterized by a Ghon complex, which includes a subpleural nodule (Ghon focus) and hilar lymphadenopathy. The histological finding of granulomas with acellular cores is consistent with caseating granulomas, which are typical of tuberculosis. Miliary tuberculosis would present with a more disseminated pattern on imaging, and sarcoidosis typically presents with non-caseating granulomas. Hodgkin lymphoma would not present with granulomas with acellular cores. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is primary tuberculosis.",9

3496,"Advance directive planning is an important aspect of patient care, especially when dealing with serious illnesses like pancreatic cancer. It ensures that the patient's wishes regarding medical treatment are known and respected. The best time to initiate this discussion is early in the course of the illness, while the patient is still capable of making informed decisions. This allows the patient to express their preferences regarding end-of-life care and ensures that their wishes are documented and can be followed. Waiting until the patient enters hospice or only discussing it if the patient initiates the conversation may result in missed opportunities to understand and respect the patient's wishes. Therefore, the physician should initiate the discussion at the current visit.",9
3489,"The patient presents with symptoms of acute pneumonia: fever, chills, dyspnea, and productive cough, along with a right lower-lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray. He has a history of HIV but has a CD4+ count of 520/mm3, which is within the normal range, indicating that his immune system is not significantly compromised. This makes opportunistic infections like Cryptococcus neoformans and Pneumocystis jirovecii less likely. The leukocytosis with neutrophilia suggests a bacterial infection. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompetent individuals, including those with HIV who have a normal CD4+ count. Staphylococcus aureus is less common in this context unless there are specific risk factors like recent influenza infection or IV drug use, which are not present here. Therefore, the most likely causal organism is Streptococcus pneumoniae.",9
3509,"The question describes a type of B cell that produces most of the circulating IgM antibodies and is associated with innate immunity. These B cells are primarily located in the peritoneal cavity and mucosal tissues. B-1 B cells are known for their role in producing natural antibodies, including IgM, and are considered part of the innate immune system. They are distinct from follicular B cells, which are involved in adaptive immunity and are found in lymphoid follicles, and from memory B cells, which are also part of adaptive immunity. Naïve B cells are precursors to other B cell types and are not specifically associated with innate immunity or high IgM production. Therefore, the physician is referring to B-1 B cells.",9
3499,"The clinical presentation of this 10-year-old boy suggests a hereditary nephritis, likely Alport syndrome. The key features include intermittent hematuria, sensorineural hearing loss, and a family history of kidney disease (his uncle died of kidney disease in his twenties). These symptoms are characteristic of Alport syndrome, which is caused by a defect in type IV collagen. This defect affects the basement membranes in the kidneys, ears, and eyes, leading to the symptoms observed in this patient. The elevated blood pressure, renal function impairment, and hematuria further support this diagnosis. The other options do not fit the clinical picture: phospholipase A2 receptor antibodies are associated with membranous nephropathy, prior streptococcal infection with post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, and vascular IgA deposits with IgA nephropathy.",9
3505,"The patient presents with sudden onset of right-sided weakness in the arm and leg, facial droop on the right side, and hyperreflexia on the right side, with intact sensation and normal speech. These symptoms are consistent with a motor stroke affecting the left side of the brain, as the motor pathways decussate in the medulla. The posterior limb of the internal capsule contains the corticospinal tract fibers that control motor function for the contralateral side of the body. An infarction in the posterior limb of the left internal capsule would result in contralateral hemiparesis (weakness on the right side in this case) and facial droop, without affecting sensation or speech, which matches the patient's presentation.",9
3510,"The patient presents with elevated liver enzymes (transaminitis) and a positive pANCA. He has a history of ulcerative colitis, which is often associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). PSC is characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the bile ducts, leading to cholestasis, which can cause elevated alkaline phosphatase levels. The negative antimitochondrial antibody makes primary biliary cirrhosis (now called primary biliary cholangitis) less likely, as it is typically positive in that condition. Acute cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis are less likely given the lack of acute symptoms and the specific antibody profile. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is primary sclerosing cholangitis.",9
3513,"The clinical presentation suggests Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), a congenital heart defect characterized by right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, ventricular septal defect, overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy. The cyanotic spells, or ""tet spells,"" occur due to increased right-to-left shunting across the ventricular septal defect, especially during times of stress or exertion. The harsh systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border is consistent with TOF. During a tet spell, increasing systemic vascular resistance can help reduce the right-to-left shunt, thereby improving oxygenation. The knee-to-chest position increases systemic vascular resistance, which can help alleviate the cyanotic spell by promoting more left-to-right shunting and improving pulmonary blood flow.",9
3515,"The patient presents with fatigue, muscle weakness, cramps, and increased urination, along with a significant finding of hypokalemia (serum potassium level of 2.1 mEq/L). He was recently started on hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), a thiazide diuretic known to cause hypokalemia by increasing renal potassium excretion. However, the severity of the hypokalemia suggests an underlying condition that exacerbates this effect. Hyperaldosteronism, characterized by excessive production of aldosterone, leads to increased sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, which can cause hypokalemia. The combination of HCTZ and hyperaldosteronism would significantly lower potassium levels. Other options like SIADH, pituitary adenoma, and Cushing's disease are less directly related to severe hypokalemia in this context. Therefore, hyperaldosteronism is the most likely underlying condition contributing to the patient's severe hypokalemia.",9
3516,"The patient presents with symptoms and ECG findings suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome, specifically non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The ST-segment depression and elevated cardiac troponin T level indicate myocardial ischemia and injury. In NSTEMI, there is typically subendocardial ischemia due to an incomplete occlusion of a coronary artery, which is consistent with the ECG findings of ST-segment depression. Subendocardial necrosis occurs due to this type of ischemia. Ventricular pseudoaneurysm is a complication that occurs later after myocardial infarction, not acutely. Coronary artery spasm is more associated with Prinzmetal's angina, which typically presents with ST-segment elevation during episodes. Therefore, the expected finding in this patient is subendocardial necrosis due to the incomplete occlusion of a coronary artery.",9
3523,"The key to solving this question is understanding the effect of increased afterload on cardiac murmurs. Clenching the fist increases systemic vascular resistance, which increases afterload. This maneuver typically increases the intensity of murmurs associated with left-to-right shunts, such as a ventricular septal defect (VSD), because the increased afterload causes more blood to flow from the left ventricle to the right ventricle through the defect. In contrast, murmurs associated with conditions like aortic stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy typically decrease in intensity with increased afterload. Therefore, the increase in murmur intensity with fist clenching suggests a VSD.",9
3518,"Phenylalanine hydroxylase is the enzyme responsible for converting phenylalanine to tyrosine. A deficiency in this enzyme leads to phenylketonuria (PKU), where phenylalanine accumulates and tyrosine becomes deficient. Therefore, individuals with PKU require dietary supplementation of tyrosine, as it becomes an essential amino acid for them due to the inability to synthesize it from phenylalanine.",10
3526,"The patient's symptoms and the description of the virus suggest a common cold, likely caused by rhinovirus. Rhinovirus is a non-enveloped RNA virus with an icosahedral capsid. It is known to bind to ICAM-1 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1) on host cells, which is a key factor in its ability to infect and cause symptoms. The other options listed are associated with different viruses: P antigen is related to parvovirus B19, CD21 is the receptor for Epstein-Barr virus, and sialic acid residues are bound by influenza virus. Therefore, the correct answer is ICAM-1.",9
3535,"The patient presents with sudden onset of abdominal pain, hypotension, tachycardia, and right adnexal tenderness, which are suggestive of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, especially given her inconsistent use of oral contraceptives and delayed menstrual period. The immediate concern is to stabilize the patient due to signs of hemodynamic instability (hypotension and tachycardia). Administering intravenous fluids is crucial to stabilize her hemodynamically. While a pelvic ultrasound is important for diagnosis, the priority is to stabilize the patient first.",9
3527,"The clinical presentation is highly suggestive of acute compartment syndrome, characterized by severe pain, paresthesias, and muscle weakness following trauma. The firm and tender calf, along with the inability to dorsiflex the foot and diminished pulses, further support this diagnosis. Immediate intervention is crucial to prevent permanent muscle and nerve damage. Fasciotomy is the definitive treatment for compartment syndrome to relieve pressure and restore circulation. Imaging or conservative management would delay necessary treatment and could lead to complications.",9
3537,"The patient presents with signs of bowel obstruction, likely complicated by bowel ischemia or perforation, given the lactic acidosis and worsening hemodynamic instability. The abdominal distension, tympanic percussion, and bilious NG tube output suggest a bowel obstruction, possibly volvulus. The rapid deterioration in vital signs indicates a surgical emergency. In this context, immediate surgical intervention is necessary to address the underlying cause, such as ischemia or perforation, which cannot be managed conservatively or with antibiotics alone. Pneumatic enema and sigmoidoscopy are not appropriate for this acute presentation, especially given the patient's instability and potential for ischemia or perforation.",9
3536,"The patient has severe acne that has not responded to her current treatment. In such cases, isotretinoin is often considered. Isotretinoin is a teratogenic medication, and it is crucial to ensure that the patient is not pregnant before starting treatment. Therefore, a pregnancy test is indicated prior to initiating isotretinoin therapy. The other options do not address the need to confirm the patient's pregnancy status before starting a potentially teratogenic medication.",9
3557,"The clinical presentation and histological findings are key to diagnosing the type of melanoma. The lesion is described as having irregular borders and is 10 mm in diameter, which is concerning for melanoma. The biopsy shows abnormal melanocytes forming nests at the dermo-epidermal junction and discohesive cell growth into the epidermis. These findings are characteristic of superficial spreading melanoma, which is the most common type of melanoma and often presents with irregular borders and a radial growth phase where melanocytes spread along the epidermis. Nodular melanoma typically presents with a vertical growth phase and lacks the radial growth phase seen here. Lentigo melanoma usually occurs on sun-damaged skin in older individuals and has a different histological pattern. Desmoplastic melanoma is characterized by spindle-shaped melanocytes and a fibrous stroma, which is not described here.",9
3548,"The patient's symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, joint pain, and cognitive issues suggest a systemic condition affecting the small intestine. The key histologic finding that aligns with these symptoms is PAS positive macrophages, which are indicative of Whipple's disease. This condition is caused by Tropheryma whipplei and is characterized by the presence of PAS positive macrophages in the small bowel biopsy. The other options do not fit the clinical picture: blunting of the villi is associated with celiac disease, absence of nerves in the myenteric plexus is seen in Hirschsprung's disease, and presence of C. trachomatis in urine is unrelated to the GI symptoms described.",9
3553,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with infectious mononucleosis, caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The positive heterophile agglutination test (Monospot test) supports this diagnosis. EBV infection is associated with an increased risk of certain malignancies, including Hodgkin lymphoma. While rheumatic fever is a complication of streptococcal pharyngitis, and Kaposi sarcoma is associated with HHV-8, these are not related to EBV. Mycotic aneurysm is not typically associated with EBV either. Therefore, the correct answer is Hodgkin lymphoma, as EBV is known to be linked to its development.",9
3539,"The patient's symptoms include progressive memory loss, weakness, diarrhea, glossitis, a hyperpigmented rash, and mental status changes. These symptoms are characteristic of pellagra, which is caused by a deficiency in niacin (Vitamin B3). Pellagra is classically described by the ""three D's"": diarrhea, dermatitis, and dementia. The patient's alcohol use can contribute to nutritional deficiencies, including niacin deficiency. The hyperpigmented rash on sun-exposed areas and the glossitis further support the diagnosis of pellagra. Therefore, the most likely deficiency in this patient is niacin (Vitamin B3).",9
3560,"The patient's symptoms and ultrasound findings suggest a kidney stone. The presence of hydronephrosis and echogenic foci with acoustic shadowing indicates a stone causing obstruction. The photomicrograph of the urine likely shows crystals that can help identify the stone type. Given the history of recurrent urinary tract infections, the most likely type of stone is struvite, which is composed of magnesium ammonium phosphate. Struvite stones are associated with infections by urease-producing bacteria, which raise the urine pH and lead to the formation of these stones.",9
3561,"The patient's symptoms and history are consistent with osteoarthritis. She has progressively worsening pain in her knees and fingers, which is worse with activity and improves with rest, a classic symptom of osteoarthritis. The morning stiffness lasting about 15 minutes is also typical for osteoarthritis, as rheumatoid arthritis would usually have stiffness lasting longer than 30 minutes. The presence of nodules on the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints (Heberden's and Bouchard's nodes) is characteristic of osteoarthritis. Her BMI indicates obesity, which is a risk factor for osteoarthritis. The history of a tick bite and treatment with amoxicillin suggests Lyme disease was considered, but her symptoms are more consistent with osteoarthritis than Lyme arthritis, which would typically involve larger joints and not present with nodules. Gout and septic arthritis are less likely given the chronicity and pattern of joint involvement.",9
3565,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are suggestive of acute pericarditis. The sharp, knife-like chest pain that is relieved by sitting up and worsened by lying down, along with the presence of a pericardial friction rub, are classic signs of pericarditis. The ECG, although not visible here, typically shows diffuse ST elevation and PR depression in acute pericarditis.

For the treatment of acute pericarditis, NSAIDs such as ibuprofen are commonly used to relieve pain and inflammation. However, to prevent recurrence of pericarditis, colchicine is often added to the treatment regimen. Colchicine has been shown to reduce the rate of recurrence of pericarditis when used in conjunction with NSAIDs or aspirin.

Aspirin is also used in the treatment of pericarditis, especially post-myocardial infarction, but colchicine is specifically noted for its role in preventing recurrence.

Systemic antibiotics are not indicated unless there is a bacterial cause, which is not suggested in this case.

Therefore, the best option to prevent recurrence of this patient's condition is colchicine.",9
3559,"The patient presents with severe lower back pain, fever, elevated inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP), and imaging findings suggestive of osteomyelitis or discitis. The x-ray shows bone destruction and sequestrum formation, which are indicative of an infectious process. The MRI findings of increased T2 signals also support this. Given the clinical presentation and imaging findings, vertebral osteomyelitis is highly suspected. The most common organism causing vertebral osteomyelitis is Staphylococcus aureus, but other organisms can also be involved. To confirm the diagnosis and identify the causative organism, a CT-guided biopsy of the affected vertebrae is the most appropriate next step. This will allow for culture and sensitivity testing to guide targeted antibiotic therapy. Surgical debridement is not indicated at this stage without evidence of an abscess or neurological compromise. Prostate-specific antigen assay is not relevant to the current presentation. Starting anti-tubercular therapy without confirmation of tuberculosis is not appropriate. Therefore, the next step is to obtain a CT-guided biopsy.",9
3547,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI), which is caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. This condition often presents with a triad of symptoms: migratory polyarthralgia, tenosynovitis, and dermatitis (such as a petechial rash). The patient has fever, joint pain, and a rash, which aligns with DGI. In DGI, the synovial fluid analysis may show a purulent effusion, but cultures can often be negative due to the fastidious nature of the organism and prior antibiotic use. Therefore, the most likely finding in this case would be a purulent joint effusion with negative culture results.",9
3574,"The clinical presentation of this 14-year-old boy is suggestive of cystic fibrosis (CF). Key features include recurrent respiratory infections, sinusitis, malabsorption with oily stools, poor weight gain despite a good appetite, and nasal polyps. In CF, the thick mucus secretions lead to blockages in various ducts and passages, including the pancreatic ducts, leading to malabsorption, and the vas deferens, leading to infertility in males. The absence of the vas deferens is a common finding in males with CF due to congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD).",9
3569,"The patient's symptoms of lethargy, headache, and nausea, along with the elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, suggest polycythemia. The key detail is that he recently moved into a basement, which raises the suspicion of carbon monoxide exposure. Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin with high affinity, reducing oxygen delivery and causing chronic cerebral hypoxia. This can lead to secondary polycythemia as the body attempts to compensate for the perceived lack of oxygen. The normal oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry does not rule out carbon monoxide poisoning, as carboxyhemoglobin is not detected by standard pulse oximetry. The other options are less likely: exogenous erythropoietin use is unlikely given the context, an inherited JAK2 mutation would suggest polycythemia vera which is less likely in this scenario, and NSAID overuse does not explain the polycythemia.",9
3567,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest cystic fibrosis, characterized by recurrent lung infections and foul-smelling stools due to pancreatic insufficiency. In cystic fibrosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common pathogen responsible for lung infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative rod that produces a green pigment (pyocyanin) and has a characteristic fruity odor. Therefore, the organism responsible for this patient's symptoms is most likely Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is described as a green gram-negative rod.",10
3576,"The clinical presentation of lethargy, vomiting, hypoglycemia, and low ketone levels in a 4-month-old suggests a metabolic disorder. The key findings are hypoglycemia (glucose 42 mg/dL) and low ketones (0.2 mg/dL), which indicate an impaired ability to generate ketones during fasting. This is characteristic of a fatty acid oxidation disorder, where the body cannot properly break down fatty acids to produce energy and ketones during periods of fasting. Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency is a common fatty acid oxidation disorder that presents with these symptoms. The elevated ammonia level also supports a metabolic disorder, as ammonia can accumulate due to impaired energy metabolism. The other enzyme deficiencies listed (B, C, D) are associated with different metabolic disorders that do not match the clinical presentation of hypoketotic hypoglycemia.",9
3570,"The patient is a 15-year-old boy with delayed puberty, as evidenced by his Tanner stage 1 genitals and sparse axillary and pubic hair. His testicular volume is also prepubertal at 2 mL bilaterally. The history of bilateral orchidopexy for cryptorchidism and cleft palate repair suggests a possible congenital condition. The lack of growth spurt and high-pitched voice indicate a lack of testosterone. Additionally, his poor hygiene and lack of awareness of body odor may suggest anosmia, although it is not explicitly mentioned. Kallmann syndrome is characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia due to a failure of GnRH neurons to migrate properly. The combination of delayed puberty, possible anosmia, and previous congenital issues like cryptorchidism and cleft palate aligns with Kallmann syndrome.",9
3581,"In this scenario, the ethical and professional obligation is to disclose the error to the patient and her family. Transparency is crucial in maintaining trust and ensuring patient safety. Even though the patient did not suffer any lasting harm, the administration of a medication that was not needed is an error that should be communicated. This allows the patient and her family to be fully informed about her care and any potential risks, even if minimal. Hospital policies generally support disclosure of errors to patients and their families, and it is a fundamental aspect of medical professionalism and ethics.",9
3587,"The patient presents with erectile dysfunction (ED) and symptoms suggestive of depression, which could indicate either an organic or psychogenic cause. To distinguish between these, a test that evaluates the physiological capability of achieving an erection is needed. 

Penile tumescence testing, specifically nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT) testing, assesses whether the patient has erections during sleep. If nocturnal erections are present, it suggests a psychogenic cause, as the physiological mechanisms are intact. If absent, it suggests an organic cause.

Biothesiometry measures penile sensitivity and is not used to distinguish between organic and psychogenic causes.

Injection of prostaglandin E1 is used to assess vascular function but does not specifically differentiate between organic and psychogenic causes.

Angiography is used to evaluate vascular anatomy and is not typically used to distinguish between organic and psychogenic ED.

Therefore, the test specifically intended to distinguish between organic and psychogenic causes is penile tumescence testing.",9
3597,"The patient's symptoms and the description of rust-colored sputum are classic for pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a Gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococcus. It is catalase negative, as it is a Streptococcus species. It is also alpha hemolytic, meaning it partially lyses red blood cells, producing a greenish discoloration on blood agar. Additionally, it is optochin sensitive, which helps differentiate it from other alpha-hemolytic streptococci like Streptococcus viridans. Therefore, the correct description of Streptococcus pneumoniae is catalase negative, alpha hemolytic, and optochin sensitive.",10
3593,"The patient's rash, along with her history of chronic diarrhea and flatulence, suggests a possible underlying condition. The elevated tissue transglutaminase (tTG) levels are indicative of celiac disease, which is an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten. The rash is likely dermatitis herpetiformis, a skin manifestation of celiac disease, caused by an immunologic response to gluten. Disseminated chlamydial infection typically does not cause a rash, and streptococcal meningitis is not relevant here. Bed bug infestations cause a different type of rash, usually with a distinct pattern of bites.",9
3602,"The clinical presentation of a rapidly enlarging jaw mass in a child from Africa, along with fever, weakness, fatigue, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, is suggestive of Burkitt lymphoma. Burkitt lymphoma is an aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is endemic in Africa and often presents with jaw involvement. The characteristic chromosomal translocation associated with Burkitt lymphoma is t(8;14), which involves the c-MYC oncogene on chromosome 8 and the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome 14. This translocation leads to overexpression of the c-MYC oncogene, driving the proliferation of B-cells. The other translocations listed are associated with different lymphomas: t(11;14) with mantle cell lymphoma, t(14;18) with follicular lymphoma, and t(15;17) with acute promyelocytic leukemia.",9
3615,"The patient presents with symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, which is indicated by the drop in blood pressure and increase in heart rate upon standing. This is likely due to hypovolemia from substantial blood loss during surgery. The patient's symptoms of weakness, dizziness, palpitations, and headache, along with the pale appearance, support this. The elevated temperature could be due to a post-surgical inflammatory response or infection, but the immediate concern is the hemodynamic instability. The best initial management for hypovolemia and orthostatic hypotension is to administer intravenous fluids to restore intravascular volume. Withholding lisinopril could be considered to prevent further hypotension, but the immediate priority is fluid resuscitation.",9
3598,"The patient was found unconscious in a car with the engine running, suggesting carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. CO binds to hemoglobin with a higher affinity than oxygen, forming carboxyhemoglobin, which reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood and impairs oxygen delivery to tissues. This leads to tissue hypoxia and a shift to anaerobic metabolism, resulting in the production of lactic acid and a metabolic acidosis. The laboratory results show a low pH (7.20), low bicarbonate (HCO3 10 mEq/L), and low PaCO2 (23 mm Hg), consistent with a primary metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation. The SaO2 is 100% due to the presence of carboxyhemoglobin, which is not detected by standard pulse oximetry. The key issue here is the decreased oxygen delivery to tissues due to CO binding, leading to anaerobic metabolism and lactic acidosis.",9
3618,"The patient's symptoms are suggestive of myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disorder characterized by weakness that worsens with activity and improves with rest. The symptoms of ptosis and diplopia, along with the pattern of fatigue, support this diagnosis. Myasthenia gravis is often associated with thymic abnormalities, and thymectomy can be an effective treatment, especially in patients with thymomas or generalized myasthenia gravis. Thymectomy can lead to improvement in symptoms and sometimes remission.",9
3617,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which is a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia. The key diagnostic clue is the cytogenetic finding of a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17, known as t(15;17). This translocation results in the PML-RARA fusion gene, which is characteristic of APL. APL is associated with a coagulopathy that can lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), as suggested by the low fibrinogen level and thrombocytopenia. The most appropriate treatment for APL is all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), which targets the PML-RARA fusion protein and induces differentiation of the promyelocytes. ATRA is crucial for both treating the leukemia and addressing the coagulopathy.",10
3624,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of intussusception, a condition where a part of the intestine telescopes into an adjacent segment, causing intermittent abdominal pain, a palpable abdominal mass, and sometimes bloody stools. The classic triad includes intermittent abdominal pain, a palpable sausage-shaped mass, and currant jelly stools. The pain relief when squatting and the presence of a palpable mass in the right upper quadrant further support this diagnosis. A technetium-99m pertechnetate scan (Meckel's scan) is used to detect ectopic gastric mucosa, often associated with Meckel's diverticulum, which can lead to intussusception. Therefore, a positive technetium-99m scan is most likely to be found in this patient.",9
3620,"The patient presents with diffuse perineal and scrotal pain, pain during ejaculation, and dysuria, without fever. The prostate is mildly tender on examination, but there is no asymmetry or induration. Laboratory studies show a normal leukocyte count and a negative urine culture, which rules out acute bacterial prostatitis. The presence of WBCs in the expressed prostatic secretions suggests inflammation, but not necessarily infection, as the culture is negative. This points towards a non-bacterial cause. Chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS), also known as chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS), is characterized by pelvic or perineal pain without evidence of urinary tract infection, lasting longer than 3 months. The negative urine culture and the symptoms align with CPPS. Prostatic abscess would typically present with fever and more severe symptoms. Benign prostatic hyperplasia usually presents with urinary obstruction symptoms, not pain. Bladder neck cancer is rare and would likely present with hematuria or obstructive symptoms rather than pain. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is chronic pelvic pain syndrome.",9
3626,"The symptoms and findings in this case suggest coarctation of the aorta. The systolic ejection murmur heard over the left sternal border and radiating to the back, along with rib notching on chest X-ray, are classic signs. Coarctation of the aorta leads to hypertension in the upper body and decreased perfusion to the lower body. If left untreated, one of the major complications is the development of collateral circulation, which can lead to increased risk of intracranial aneurysms and subsequent hemorrhage due to the increased pressure in the cerebral circulation. Therefore, the greatest risk for this patient if left untreated is intracranial hemorrhage.",9
3623,"The patient is a 37-year-old woman at 36 weeks' gestation with decreased fetal movements and gestational hypertension. The ultrasound shows decreased amniotic fluid, which suggests oligohydramnios. The uterus is smaller than expected for gestational age, consistent with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). These findings, along with gestational hypertension, point towards placental insufficiency. Placental insufficiency can lead to decreased fetal movements and oligohydramnios due to reduced placental perfusion and fetal compromise. The fetal heart tracing likely shows signs of fetal distress, which is consistent with placental insufficiency.",9
3638,"The patient presents with recurrent episodes of facial swelling and abdominal pain, with a family history of similar symptoms. The laboratory findings show low levels of C1 esterase inhibitor, C4, and C2, which are indicative of hereditary angioedema (HAE). HAE is characterized by low C1 esterase inhibitor levels and low complement levels, leading to episodes of angioedema. ACE inhibitors, such as fosinopril, are contraindicated in patients with HAE because they can precipitate or worsen angioedema by increasing bradykinin levels. Therefore, fosinopril should be avoided in this patient.",9
3633,"The patient's symptoms and recent travel history suggest acute viral hepatitis, likely hepatitis A, which is common in areas like Mexico. The symptoms of malaise, nausea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, and jaundice (scleral icterus) are consistent with this diagnosis. In acute viral hepatitis, liver biopsy typically shows ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes, Councilman bodies (apoptotic hepatocytes), and bridging necrosis due to the inflammatory process. This matches with option B.",9
3610,"The child presents with a heart murmur that decreases with Valsalva maneuver and increases with hand grip and squatting. These maneuvers affect preload and afterload, which are useful in distinguishing different types of murmurs. The Valsalva maneuver decreases venous return (preload), which typically decreases the intensity of most murmurs except those associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and mitral valve prolapse (MVP). The murmur increasing with hand grip and squatting suggests increased afterload, which typically increases the intensity of murmurs associated with mitral regurgitation, aortic regurgitation, and ventricular septal defect (VSD). Given these findings, the most likely murmur is a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur radiating to the carotids, which is characteristic of aortic stenosis. However, this murmur typically decreases with Valsalva, which is not consistent with this case. The next most likely option is a holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border, which is characteristic of a VSD and would increase with increased afterload (hand grip and squatting), making option D the correct choice.",9
3643,"The patient's symptoms of fatigue, muscle cramps, tingling in the hands, and carpopedal spasm suggest hypocalcemia. The prolonged QT interval on ECG also supports this. The chronic cough and smoking history raise suspicion for a lung-related condition. Ectopic hormone production, particularly parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) from a lung tumor, could cause hypercalcemia, not hypocalcemia. Destruction of the parathyroid glands, such as in primary hypoparathyroidism, would lead to hypocalcemia. Vitamin D deficiency could also cause hypocalcemia, but the acute presentation and the presence of carpopedal spasm are more suggestive of hypoparathyroidism. Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) is less likely given the presentation. Therefore, the most likely cause of the symptoms is destruction of the parathyroid glands.",9
3653,"The patient is 30 weeks pregnant and presents with hypertension (150/92 mm Hg), proteinuria (2+), and edema, which are indicative of preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is a condition that can occur after 20 weeks of gestation and is characterized by new-onset hypertension and proteinuria. One of the known complications of preeclampsia is abruptio placentae, which is the premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall. This condition can lead to significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The other options, such as spontaneous abortion, uterine rupture, and polyhydramnios, are not directly associated with preeclampsia. Therefore, the patient is at increased risk of developing abruptio placentae due to her preeclampsia.",9
3658,"The patient is experiencing chest pain suggestive of angina, and the medication given is likely a nitrate, which generates nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide is a vasodilator that works by diffusing into vascular smooth muscle cells and activating guanylyl cyclase. This enzyme converts GTP to cGMP, leading to smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. The downstream effect of nitric oxide is therefore the activation of guanylyl cyclase, which increases cGMP levels.",9
3662,"The patient received blood products as part of his initial management after the accident. He later develops a fever (101°F) and symptoms such as feeling hot, aches, and a headache. These symptoms are consistent with a febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction, which is the most common type of transfusion reaction. It is typically caused by cytokines released from donor leukocytes and usually presents with fever and chills within 1-6 hours after transfusion. Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions are more severe and present with symptoms like fever, chills, back pain, and hemoglobinuria, often immediately or within a few hours of transfusion. Leukoagglutination reactions are rare and involve respiratory distress. Minor blood group incompatibility can cause mild reactions but is less common than febrile non-hemolytic reactions. Given the timing and symptoms, a febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction is the most likely diagnosis.",9
3664,"The patient is showing signs of hypocalcemia, which is common after thyroidectomy due to potential damage or removal of the parathyroid glands. The symptoms include irritability, muscle spasms, and positive Trousseau and Chvostek signs, all indicative of low calcium levels. The laboratory result confirms hypocalcemia with a calcium level of 4.4 mg/dL (normal range is approximately 8.5-10.5 mg/dL). To prevent hypocalcemia after thyroid surgery, supplementation with calcium and vitamin D is recommended. Vitamin D helps increase calcium absorption from the gut, and calcium supplementation directly addresses the low calcium levels. Therefore, the administration of vitamin D and ionic calcium prior to and after the operation would help prevent the hypocalcemia seen in this patient.",9
3672,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of rhabdomyolysis, which is characterized by muscle soreness, dark urine, and significantly elevated creatine kinase levels. The urine analysis shows 3+ blood without red blood cells, indicating myoglobinuria. Myoglobin released from damaged muscle cells can cause acute tubular necrosis, leading to acute kidney injury (AKI). This is a well-known complication of rhabdomyolysis due to the nephrotoxic effects of myoglobin on the kidneys.",9
3668,"To calculate the number needed to treat (NNT) to save one life, we need to determine the absolute risk reduction (ARR) between the two treatments. The ARR is the difference in mortality rates between the two groups. In this study, the mortality rate for carvedilol is 34% and for metoprolol is 40%. The ARR is calculated as 0.40 - 0.34 = 0.06. The NNT is the inverse of the ARR, which is 1/ARR. Therefore, the NNT is 1/0.06.",10
3673,"The patient is experiencing elevated glucose levels at night and in the morning before his NPH dose, indicating that his basal insulin coverage is insufficient overnight. NPH insulin is an intermediate-acting insulin that typically lasts around 12-16 hours, so a single morning dose may not provide adequate coverage throughout the night. Adding another dose of NPH in the evening would extend the basal insulin coverage overnight, potentially reducing the elevated glucose levels observed at night and in the morning. The HbA1C level of 6.2% suggests overall good control, but the specific issue is the overnight glucose levels. Adding a dose of NPH in the evening directly addresses this problem.",9
3674,"The patient is a 17-year-old male who is sexually active and uses condoms inconsistently. The HPV vaccine is recommended for males and females starting at ages 11-12, but catch-up vaccination is recommended up to age 26. Since he is 17 and has not been mentioned to have received the HPV vaccine, it is appropriate to administer it now. Option C is incorrect because waiting until age 18 is unnecessary and would delay protection. Option A is not appropriate as there is no indication of a current sexually transmitted infection that requires treatment. Option D is not necessary as there is no clinical indication for a urine toxicology screen based on the information provided.",9
3684,"The medium described is Thayer-Martin agar, which is selective for Neisseria species, particularly Neisseria gonorrhoeae. This medium contains antibiotics like vancomycin, colistin, and nystatin to inhibit the growth of gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria other than Neisseria, and fungi, respectively. The organism that grows on this medium is likely to be Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which is known to cause gonorrhea.",10
3690,"The male partner's symptoms and laboratory findings are suggestive of Klinefelter syndrome, which is characterized by the presence of an extra X chromosome (47,XXY karyotype). This condition leads to features such as gynecomastia, small testes, and infertility, along with elevated gonadotropins (LH and FSH) and low testosterone levels. In individuals with Klinefelter syndrome, the presence of an extra X chromosome results in the formation of a Barr body, which is an inactivated X chromosome. Therefore, cytogenetic tests would reveal the presence of a Barr body in this male.",9
3683,"The patient's symptoms and the Rinne test results suggest sensorineural hearing loss, as air conduction is greater than bone conduction bilaterally. The difficulty understanding women more than men indicates a loss of high-frequency hearing, which is characteristic of presbycusis, a common age-related hearing loss. Presbycusis is associated with damage to the hair cells in the cochlea, particularly those responsible for high-frequency sounds. The basal turn of the cochlea is where high-frequency sounds are processed, making it the most likely site of damage in this case.",9
3689,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with traveler's diarrhea, which is common after visiting areas like the Yucatan peninsula. The most likely cause of traveler's diarrhea is enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). ETEC is known for producing heat-labile and heat-stable enterotoxins. The heat-stable toxin (ST) causes overactivation of guanylate cyclase, leading to increased cyclic GMP levels, which results in increased secretion of fluids and electrolytes into the intestinal lumen, causing diarrhea. 

- Option A, production of lecithinase, is associated with Clostridium perfringens.
- Option B, presynaptic vesicle dysregulation, is associated with Clostridium botulinum.
- Option D, disabling Gi alpha subunit, is associated with Bordetella pertussis.

Therefore, the characteristic of the microorganism most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms is overactivation of guanylate cyclase.",9
3698,"The patient's history and symptoms suggest a transformation of a previous hematological condition. Eight years ago, he was treated for a malignancy with CD15+ and CD30+ cells, which are markers for Hodgkin lymphoma. The current symptoms of fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, pallor, and petechiae, along with the peripheral blood smear findings, suggest a transformation to a leukemia. Given the history of Hodgkin lymphoma and the current presentation, the most likely explanation is a secondary leukemia, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which can occur as a complication of previous chemotherapy or radiation treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma. This aligns with option D, radiation-induced myeloid leukemia, as a plausible explanation for his current condition.",9
3699,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a peptic ulcer, specifically a duodenal ulcer, given the timing of the pain after meals. The positive urease breath test indicates the presence of Helicobacter pylori infection, which is a common cause of peptic ulcers. The first-line treatment for H. pylori infection is triple therapy, which includes a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and two antibiotics. The standard regimen is amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and a PPI such as omeprazole. Option C matches this regimen. Option D is a quadruple therapy used as a second-line treatment or in cases of resistance or allergy. Options A and B are not appropriate for H. pylori eradication.",9
3700,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are key to diagnosing her condition. She presents with a malodorous gray vaginal discharge, which is characteristic of bacterial vaginosis. Bacterial vaginosis is caused by an imbalance in the normal bacterial flora of the vagina, often leading to an overgrowth of Gardnerella vaginalis. The discharge is typically thin, gray, and has a fishy odor. Gonorrhea and syphilis usually present with different symptoms, such as urethritis or genital ulcers, respectively. Vaginal candidiasis typically presents with thick, white, ""cottage cheese-like"" discharge and is often associated with itching, which this patient does not have. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is bacterial vaginosis.",9
3702,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest adenomyosis. She has a history of multiple pregnancies, which is a risk factor, and presents with symptoms such as pelvic heaviness, cramping, and a boggy, enlarged uterus. Adenomyosis is characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue within the myometrium, which explains the boggy texture and the uterine enlargement. The other options do not fit the clinical picture: endometriosis involves endometrial tissue outside the uterus, focal hyperplasia of the myometrium is not typical for adenomyosis, and nuclear atypia of endometrial cells suggests a precancerous or cancerous condition, not adenomyosis.",9
3704,"The patient's T score of -4.1 indicates severe osteoporosis. Reviewing her medication history, lansoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), is known to potentially contribute to osteoporosis. PPIs can decrease calcium absorption by reducing stomach acidity, which is necessary for calcium solubilization and absorption. Hydrochlorothiazide is actually associated with increased bone density due to its calcium-sparing effects. Lithium has not been strongly associated with osteoporosis. Estrogen, especially in the form of oral contraceptives, generally has a protective effect on bone density. Therefore, the medication most likely contributing to her osteoporosis is lansoprazole.",9
3703,"The symptoms described in the vignette are consistent with narcolepsy, particularly the presence of cataplexy (sudden muscle weakness triggered by strong emotions or stimuli) and hypnagogic hallucinations (seeing ghosts before falling asleep). In narcolepsy, polysomnography with EEG typically shows a rapid onset of REM sleep, which is characterized by beta waves. This rapid transition to REM sleep is unusual and is a hallmark of narcolepsy.",9
3646,,0
3705,"The patient is experiencing postpartum hemorrhage, likely due to uterine atony, as indicated by the soft, enlarged, and boggy uterus. Initial management includes bimanual uterine massage and oxytocin, which have already been attempted without success. The next step is to use additional uterotonics. Carboprost tromethamine is a prostaglandin analogue used to treat uterine atony. However, it is contraindicated in patients with asthma due to the risk of bronchospasm. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent that can be used to reduce bleeding and is appropriate in this scenario, especially given the patient's history of asthma.",9
3708,"The newborn presents with signs of a serious infection, including high fever, lethargy, and respiratory distress. The key clinical finding is the positive Brudzinski sign, indicating possible meningitis. Given the age of the newborn (6 days old) and the history of home birth with limited prenatal care, the most likely source of infection is vertical transmission during birth. Common pathogens transmitted during birth include Group B Streptococcus, E. coli, and Listeria monocytogenes. These infections can lead to neonatal sepsis and meningitis. The lack of prenatal care increases the risk of undiagnosed maternal infections that could be transmitted to the newborn during delivery.",9
3712,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of hemolytic anemia: sudden abdominal pain, dark urine, scleral icterus, and splenomegaly. The lab results show low hemoglobin, elevated reticulocyte count, elevated indirect bilirubin, low haptoglobin, and hemoglobinuria, all consistent with hemolysis. The recent history of a urinary tract infection treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, a sulfa drug, is significant. The patient is of African descent, which increases the likelihood of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, a condition that can cause hemolytic anemia when exposed to certain drugs, infections, or foods. The normal MCV and the absence of sickle cells or cold agglutinins further support G6PD deficiency as the cause. Lead poisoning does not fit the acute presentation or the lab findings. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause is deficient glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.",9
3711,"The patient is a young woman with episodes of chest pain and palpitations, which are suggestive of panic attacks, especially given her age, the nature of the symptoms, and the normal ECG findings. Her symptoms resolved spontaneously in the past, and she appears fidgety and restless, which are common signs of anxiety. In the acute setting, the best treatment for a panic attack is a fast-acting benzodiazepine like alprazolam to quickly alleviate symptoms. Nitroglycerin is used for angina, which is unlikely given her normal ECG and presentation. Buspirone and sertraline are used for long-term management of anxiety but are not effective for acute symptom relief.",9
3714,"The patient presents with amenorrhea, headaches, and bitemporal hemianopsia (loss of peripheral vision). These symptoms suggest a mass effect on the optic chiasm, commonly caused by a pituitary adenoma. The adenohypophysis, or anterior pituitary gland, is the most likely site of abnormal growth. A pituitary adenoma can secrete hormones or cause pressure effects, leading to menstrual irregularities and visual field defects due to compression of the optic chiasm.",9
3717,"The patient is a 53-year-old woman with symptoms of painful intercourse, vaginal dryness, and occasional spotting. These symptoms, along with her last menstrual period being 8 months ago, suggest she is in the perimenopausal or early postmenopausal phase. The pelvic examination findings of decreasing labial fat pad and receding pubic hair further support estrogen deficiency, which is common in menopause. The clear vaginal discharge and absence of urinary symptoms make an infectious cause less likely. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for her symptoms, which are likely due to atrophic vaginitis (vaginal atrophy due to estrogen deficiency), is topical estrogen cream.",9
3720,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome, likely an acute myocardial infarction (MI), given the crushing substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, and S4 gallop. The S4 gallop indicates decreased compliance of the left ventricle, often seen in ischemic heart disease. The ECG, although not shown here, would likely show ST-segment changes indicative of an MI. The most common cause of an acute MI is the occlusion of a coronary artery due to atherosclerotic plaque rupture and subsequent thrombus formation. The left anterior descending (LAD) artery is the most commonly occluded artery in myocardial infarctions. The patient's risk factors, including smoking and stress, further support the likelihood of coronary artery disease leading to an MI. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is occlusion of the LAD artery.",9
3723,"The patient is a chronic alcoholic who presented with vomiting, diarrhea, and poor oral intake, leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Upon treatment with normal saline, potassium, dextrose, thiamine, and folic acid, he develops confusion, weakness, and muscle/bone pain. These symptoms are consistent with refeeding syndrome, which can occur when a malnourished patient is given carbohydrates (dextrose). This leads to increased insulin secretion, driving electrolytes like phosphate into cells, resulting in hypophosphatemia. Hypophosphatemia can cause muscle weakness, confusion, and bone pain, which aligns with the patient's new symptoms.",9
3728,"The patient has signs of liver cirrhosis, likely due to chronic alcoholism. In alcoholic liver disease, the earliest site of fibrous deposition is typically in the perisinusoidal space, also known as the space of Disse. This is where stellate cells (Ito cells) become activated and start depositing collagen in response to liver injury. Over time, this leads to the development of fibrosis and eventually cirrhosis.",9
3733,"The patient presents with episodic chest pain that is atypical for angina, as it is unrelated to exercise and does not radiate. The episodes are brief and associated with anxiety, and the patient is currently asymptomatic. Her risk factors include hyperlipidemia, but she has no other significant risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) such as smoking or diabetes. The ECG shows only sinus tachycardia, which is nonspecific. Given the atypical nature of the chest pain and the absence of symptoms at present, the pre-test probability of CAD is low. Therefore, further testing for CAD is not immediately necessary. The most appropriate next step is to reassure the patient and consider other causes of her symptoms, such as esophageal spasm or anxiety.",9
3730,"The clinical presentation of the 5-year-old girl includes a fine, red petechial rash and easy bruising, which are indicative of a bleeding disorder. The key laboratory finding is thrombocytopenia (low platelet count of 20,000/mm3), while other blood parameters, including PT and PTT, are normal. This suggests a disorder primarily affecting platelets rather than the coagulation cascade.

Hemophilia A and B are characterized by deficiencies in clotting factors VIII and IX, respectively, leading to prolonged PTT, which is not observed here. Von Willebrand disease typically presents with mucosal bleeding and may have a prolonged PTT due to factor VIII involvement, but it does not cause significant thrombocytopenia.

Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune condition where antibodies target platelets, leading to their destruction and resulting in thrombocytopenia. The history of a recent viral infection (minor cold) is a common trigger for ITP in children. The normal PT and PTT further support ITP, as these tests assess the coagulation cascade, which is not affected in ITP.

Therefore, the most likely blood disorder is Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).",9
3746,"The patient presents with a combination of symptoms that include headaches, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and specific neurological findings. The most concerning neurological finding is the right-sided weakness with decreased reflexes, which suggests a possible central nervous system issue such as a mass effect or lesion. This is more concerning than the other options because it indicates a potential focal neurological deficit that requires further investigation. Obesity, age of onset, and photophobia are less specific and less concerning in this context compared to the focal neurological deficit.",9
3739,"The patient's biopsy shows destruction of the upper glandular layer of the gastric mucosa and G-cell hyperplasia, which is indicative of chronic atrophic gastritis, likely autoimmune in nature given her history of Hashimoto thyroiditis. This condition is associated with the destruction of parietal cells, leading to achlorhydria and hypergastrinemia, which can cause G-cell hyperplasia. Chronic atrophic gastritis increases the risk of gastric adenocarcinoma due to the chronic inflammation and intestinal metaplasia that can occur over time. While gastric MALT lymphoma is also associated with chronic gastritis, it is more commonly linked to H. pylori infection rather than autoimmune gastritis. Therefore, the greatest risk for this patient is gastric adenocarcinoma.",9
3753,"The patient is experiencing auditory hallucinations, suggesting a psychotic disorder, likely schizophrenia. The medication initially prescribed was likely an antipsychotic. The return of symptoms indicates treatment resistance, for which clozapine is often used due to its efficacy in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. However, clozapine requires frequent monitoring due to the risk of agranulocytosis, a potentially life-threatening drop in white blood cells. The lab results show a low WBC count (2500 cells/mcL), which is consistent with clozapine-induced agranulocytosis. Therefore, the drug prescribed is clozapine.",9
3752,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest a case of gas gangrene, typically caused by Clostridium perfringens. This organism is an anaerobic gram-positive rod that produces a double zone of hemolysis on blood agar. The crackling sound (crepitus) is due to gas production by the bacteria. Clostridium perfringens produces several toxins, but the most notable is alpha toxin, which is a phospholipase (lecithinase). This toxin degrades cell membranes, leading to cell lysis and tissue necrosis. Therefore, the mechanism of cellular damage in this case is the degradation of cell membranes by phospholipase.",9
3757,"The patient's presentation is consistent with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). She has severe lower abdominal pain, fever, and malaise, which are common symptoms of PID. The negative pregnancy test rules out a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. The presence of cervical motion tenderness, uterine and adnexal tenderness, and purulent cervical discharge further supports the diagnosis of PID. While cervicitis could explain the cervical inflammation and discharge, it would not typically cause the severe abdominal pain and systemic symptoms like fever. Vaginitis would not cause cervical motion tenderness or significant abdominal pain. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is pelvic inflammatory disease.",9
3760,"The patient is experiencing preterm labor at 31 weeks gestation, as indicated by regular contractions and cervical dilation. The contraction strength is 220 MVU, which confirms active labor. Given her history of preterm delivery and current preterm labor, the goal is to delay delivery to allow for fetal lung maturity and reduce neonatal complications. 

Magnesium sulfate is used for neuroprotection in preterm labor before 32 weeks gestation. Betamethasone is administered to accelerate fetal lung maturity. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is a combination of magnesium sulfate for neuroprotection and betamethasone for fetal lung maturity enhancement.",9
3748,"The patient is experiencing tardive dyskinesia, a side effect of long-term use of antipsychotic medications, particularly first-generation antipsychotics. The next best step in management is to switch to a medication that has a lower risk of causing tardive dyskinesia. Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic that is often used in such cases due to its lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms. However, clozapine has a significant side effect profile, including the risk of agranulocytosis, which can lead to severe infections. Therefore, the side effect associated with the next best step, which is starting clozapine, is infection due to agranulocytosis.",9
3773,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS). She has anterior knee pain that worsens with activities that increase patellofemoral joint stress, such as prolonged sitting and stair climbing. The pain is reproduced by applying pressure to the patella, and there is increased patellar laxity, which is common in PFPS due to maltracking of the patella. Iliotibial band syndrome typically causes lateral knee pain, prepatellar bursitis would present with swelling over the patella, and Osgood-Schlatter's disease is more common in adolescents and presents with pain over the tibial tuberosity.",9
3770,"The clinical presentation described is consistent with complex partial seizures, also known as focal impaired awareness seizures. These seizures often originate in the temporal lobe and can include automatisms such as lip-smacking, as well as postictal confusion and fatigue. The episodes last longer than typical absence seizures and include a postictal state, which is not characteristic of absence seizures. Given these features, an EEG would likely show temporal lobe spikes, which are indicative of seizure activity originating from that area of the brain.",9
3771,"The clinical presentation suggests post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN), which typically occurs after a streptococcal infection, such as impetigo or pharyngitis. The boy had a recent crusty sore, likely impetigo, caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. The symptoms of facial swelling, dark urine, and hypertension align with nephritic syndrome, commonly seen in PSGN. The serological findings show decreased C3 and normal C4, which is characteristic of PSGN due to complement consumption. PSGN is caused by the deposition of antigen-antibody complexes in the glomeruli, leading to complement activation and inflammation. Therefore, the condition is due to antigen-antibody complex deposition.",9
3775,"The patient's presentation is consistent with acute gouty arthritis, characterized by sudden onset of severe pain, swelling, and redness in the joint, often the big toe (podagra). His high BMI and recent alcohol consumption are risk factors for gout. Joint aspiration in gout typically reveals needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals under polarized light, which are monosodium urate crystals. This finding is diagnostic of gout.",9
3784,"The patient's presentation is consistent with acute angle-closure glaucoma. This condition is characterized by sudden onset of severe eye pain, blurred vision, a firm eye on palpation, a dilated and non-reactive pupil, and nausea. The cloudy cornea and injected conjunctiva further support this diagnosis. The initial treatment for acute angle-closure glaucoma is to lower intraocular pressure. Intravenous acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that reduces aqueous humor production, thereby lowering intraocular pressure quickly. This makes it the most appropriate initial treatment in this scenario.",9
3788,"To curb the spread of the virus via containment, it is crucial to identify and isolate as many infected individuals as possible. This means the test should have a high sensitivity, which is the ability to correctly identify those with the disease (true positives). A highly sensitive test will minimize false negatives, ensuring that most infected individuals are detected and isolated, thereby preventing further transmission. 

From the table:
- True positives (TP) = 95
- False negatives (FN) = 5

Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN) = 95 / (95 + 5) = 95/100.

Thus, the sensitivity of 95/100 is the most useful characteristic for containment, as it ensures that the majority of infected individuals are identified and can be isolated to prevent further spread.",9
3791,"The patient's symptoms and radiographic findings are key to diagnosing her condition. She has knee pain that started after a fall, progressively worsened, and is associated with swelling and erythema. The physical exam shows tenderness over the femoral condyles, and the radiograph reveals a crescent-shaped radiolucency in the subchondral bone of the femur. This radiographic finding is characteristic of osteochondritis dissecans, which involves a segment of bone and cartilage separating from the surrounding area due to lack of blood supply. The other options do not match the radiographic findings: an ACL injury would not show a crescent-shaped radiolucency, Osgood-Schlatter disease affects the tibial tuberosity, and osteogenesis imperfecta would present with multiple fractures or bone deformities, not a localized radiolucency.",9
3800,"In this scenario, the physician is offered a valuable gift from a patient. According to medical ethics, physicians should avoid accepting gifts that could influence their professional judgment or appear to do so. Accepting valuable gifts can create a conflict of interest or the appearance of impropriety. Therefore, the most appropriate action is to politely decline the gift and explain the ethical guidelines that prevent accepting such gifts.",9
3797,"This patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus who ran out of insulin is likely experiencing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is characterized by hyperglycemia, ketonemia, and metabolic acidosis with an increased anion gap. The rapid and deep breathing (Kussmaul respiration) is a compensatory mechanism for metabolic acidosis. In DKA, the arterial blood gas would show a decreased pH (acidosis), decreased bicarbonate (due to buffering of excess ketone bodies), and an increased anion gap due to the accumulation of ketoacids. Therefore, the arterial blood gas would most likely show decreased pH, decreased bicarbonate, and increased anion gap.",10
3796,"The patient is at 35 weeks' gestation and presents with a placenta previa, as indicated by the ultrasound showing the placenta covering the internal os. Placenta previa is a condition where the placenta covers the cervix, which can cause bleeding and poses a risk during vaginal delivery. In this case, the bleeding has subsided, and the patient is stable with no contractions. Performing a bimanual pelvic examination (option C) is contraindicated in placenta previa due to the risk of provoking severe bleeding. Administering oxytocin to induce labor (option B) is also inappropriate because vaginal delivery is contraindicated in placenta previa. An emergency cesarean delivery (option A) is not necessary at this moment since the patient is stable and the bleeding has stopped. The most appropriate management is to schedule an elective cesarean delivery (option D) at a later date, closer to term, unless there is further bleeding or other complications that necessitate earlier delivery.",9
3807,"The patient's symptoms of limb weakness, decreased strength in all extremities, and depressed deep tendon reflexes suggest a condition affecting neuromuscular excitability. The key detail is the generalized decreased neuronal excitability due to an electrolyte imbalance. Hypercalcemia is known to decrease neuronal excitability by stabilizing the neuronal membrane and reducing the likelihood of depolarization. This can lead to muscle weakness and depressed reflexes, which aligns with the patient's presentation. Other electrolyte imbalances listed, such as hypomagnesemia, hypernatremia, and hypochloremia, do not typically present with this specific combination of symptoms related to decreased neuronal excitability.",9
3801,"Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that acts as an estrogen antagonist in breast tissue, which is why it is used in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. However, it has partial agonist effects in other tissues. 

- In the endometrium, tamoxifen acts as an estrogen agonist, which can increase the risk of endometrial cancer, not decrease it. Therefore, option A is incorrect.
- Tamoxifen is known to increase the risk of thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), due to its estrogenic effects in the liver, which can increase clotting factors. Thus, option B is correct.
- Tamoxifen has a protective effect on bone density, reducing the risk of osteoporosis, due to its estrogenic effects on bone. Therefore, option C is correct.
- Tamoxifen can cause ocular toxicity, including cataracts and retinopathy, so option D is correct.

Thus, the effect that is NOT associated with tamoxifen is a decreased risk of endometrial cancer.",9
3808,"The patient's symptoms and family history suggest a hereditary nephritis, likely Alport syndrome. Key features include hematuria, sensorineural hearing loss, and ocular abnormalities (such as lens protrusion, which could be anterior lenticonus). The family history of a brother dying from kidney disease at a young age supports a genetic condition. Alport syndrome is caused by a defect in type IV collagen, which affects the kidneys, ears, and eyes. The elevated blood pressure, renal insufficiency, and hematuria with RBC casts are consistent with this diagnosis. IgA deposits are associated with IgA nephropathy, which does not typically present with hearing loss or ocular abnormalities. WT1 gene mutations are linked to Wilms tumor and nephrotic syndromes, not the combination of symptoms seen here. Autosomal-recessive kidney disease, such as ARPKD, presents differently and usually earlier in life.",9
3809,"The clinical presentation and CSF findings are consistent with bacterial meningitis. The presence of gram-negative coccobacilli in the CSF suggests Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) as the causative organism, especially given the patient's lack of vaccination. Children with sickle cell disease are at increased risk for infections with encapsulated organisms like Hib due to functional asplenia. One of the known complications of bacterial meningitis, particularly with Hib, is sensorineural hearing loss. This occurs due to inflammation and damage to the cochlea and auditory pathways. While other complications like adrenal insufficiency (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome) are associated with Neisseria meningitidis, and cerebral palsy or hydrocephalus can occur with severe meningitis, hearing loss is the most common and specific complication associated with Hib meningitis.",9
3812,"The patient has sustained a calcaneal fracture from a fall, which is a common injury associated with axial loading. Such falls can also result in other injuries, particularly to the spine, due to the force of impact. The most concerning potential injury in this context is a vertebral fracture, especially in the lumbar or thoracic spine. Given the mechanism of injury and the presence of a calcaneal fracture, it is important to rule out any associated spinal injuries. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to perform an x-ray of the spine to check for any vertebral fractures.",9
3815,"The patient presents with significant weight loss, weakness, and a history of alcohol use and smoking. These symptoms, along with his history, raise suspicion for a possible malignancy, particularly given his smoking history and the incidental finding of gallstones. The emaciated appearance and weight loss suggest a systemic issue, possibly involving the liver or pancreas. A CT scan of the abdomen is the most comprehensive imaging study to evaluate for potential malignancies or other abdominal pathologies that could explain his symptoms. A CT scan of the liver alone would be too focused, and a HIDA scan is more specific for gallbladder function, which is not the primary concern here. Smoking cessation advice is important but does not address the acute need to diagnose the underlying cause of his symptoms.",9
3817,"The patient presents with somnolence, respiratory depression (respirations at 9/min), and miosis (pupils that do not respond to light), which are classic signs of opioid overdose. The presence of an unknown powder among his belongings raises suspicion for opioid use, possibly heroin or another opioid. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that can rapidly reverse the effects of opioid overdose, including respiratory depression. While other substances are present, the immediate concern is the respiratory depression, which is best addressed with naloxone. Flumazenil is used for benzodiazepine overdose but is not indicated here due to the risk of seizures and the more pressing need to address respiratory depression. N-acetylcysteine is for acetaminophen overdose, which is not indicated by the symptoms. Supportive therapy, thiamine, and dextrose are general supportive measures but do not specifically address the acute respiratory depression.",9
3822,"The patient presents with signs of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, likely due to esophageal varices, given his history of alcohol use and signs of portal hypertension (ascites, thrombocytopenia, and splenomegaly). In cases of variceal bleeding, initial management includes stabilization with IV fluids and medications like octreotide to reduce portal pressure. Prophylactic antibiotics, such as intravenous ceftriaxone, are crucial to prevent infections like spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, which are common in cirrhotic patients with GI bleeding. Therefore, after starting IV fluids and octreotide, the next step is to administer IV ceftriaxone.",9
3816,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a secondary bacterial infection following an initial viral illness, likely influenza. The sputum culture shows gram-positive, coagulase-positive cocci in clusters, which is characteristic of Staphylococcus aureus. The erythematous, desquamating rash and hypotension suggest toxic shock syndrome, which is associated with the production of toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) by Staphylococcus aureus. TSST-1 is a superantigen that causes massive T-cell activation and cytokine release, leading to the symptoms observed. The function of this virulence factor is not directly listed in the options, but the closest match is the mechanism of action of superantigens, which is similar to option B, as they bind to the MHC class II and T-cell receptor, leading to non-specific T-cell activation. However, option B specifically describes protein A, another virulence factor of Staphylococcus aureus, which binds the Fc region of IgG, helping the bacteria evade phagocytosis. Given the options, option B is the best match for a virulence factor of Staphylococcus aureus.",9
3826,"The patient is a 17-year-old girl with secondary amenorrhea, low estradiol levels, and low gonadotropins (FSH and LH). She is thin, has bilateral parotid gland enlargement, and fine hair over the trunk, which are suggestive of an eating disorder, likely anorexia nervosa. The low estradiol and gonadotropin levels indicate hypothalamic suppression, which is common in nutritional deficiencies due to excessive exercise and/or eating disorders. The normal TSH and prolactin levels rule out thyroid dysfunction and hyperprolactinemia as causes. The negative pregnancy test excludes pregnancy. Exogenous steroid use, defective androgen receptors, and gonadal dysgenesis do not fit the clinical picture as well as nutritional deficiency does. Therefore, the most likely cause of these findings is nutritional deficiency due to an eating disorder.",9
3823,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), characterized by excessive worry, muscle tension, irritability, and sleep disturbances. Buspirone is an anxiolytic that is particularly effective for GAD and is not associated with the dependency risks of benzodiazepines like diazepam. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that can be used for anxiety but is not the first-line treatment due to potential for dependence. Family therapy and support groups can be helpful adjuncts but do not directly address the anxiety symptoms pharmacologically. Therefore, the best course of treatment for this patient is buspirone.",9
3831,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1), which includes primary hyperparathyroidism, pituitary tumors, and pancreatic endocrine tumors. The abdominal pain, foul-smelling diarrhea, and peptic ulcers suggest a gastrinoma (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome), which is common in MEN 1. The flank pain and hyperechogenic structures in the ureteropelvic junction suggest nephrolithiasis, likely due to hypercalcemia from primary hyperparathyroidism. Hypercalcemia can lead to kidney stones, abdominal pain, and fatigue. Therefore, further evaluation is most likely to show hypercalcemia.",9
3832,"The patient presents with a chronic cough, significant sputum production, and a history of frequent exacerbations requiring hospitalization. She has had a cough with sputum production for most months over the last 3 years, which aligns with the definition of chronic bronchitis. The pulmonary function tests show an obstructive pattern with an FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 0.7, and there is minimal reversibility with bronchodilators, which is more characteristic of chronic bronchitis than asthma. Her occupational exposure to cotton dust could contribute to her symptoms, but the clinical picture is more consistent with chronic bronchitis. Asthma typically shows more reversibility with bronchodilators. Emphysema would present with more significant lung volume changes, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis would show a restrictive pattern, not obstructive.",9
3829,"The patient presents with excessive daytime sleepiness, loud snoring, and frequent nighttime awakenings, which are classic symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). His obesity (BMI of 33 kg/m2) is a significant risk factor for OSA. The presence of pitting edema could be related to right heart strain due to OSA, but the key symptoms point towards airway obstruction during sleep. The arterial blood gas analysis shows normal pH and PCO2, indicating no significant daytime hypoventilation. The normal chest x-ray rules out other pulmonary causes. The most likely underlying cause of OSA is the intermittent collapse of the oropharynx during sleep, leading to airway obstruction and the symptoms described.",9
3843,"The patient has multiple sclerosis (MS), which can affect the nervous system and lead to various types of urinary incontinence. The key details in the question are the involuntary loss of urine without urge, intermittent urinary stream, and a post-void residual volume of 131 mL, which is elevated. This suggests that the bladder is not emptying completely. In MS, detrusor sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) is a common cause of urinary symptoms. DSD occurs when there is a lack of coordination between the bladder muscle (detrusor) and the urinary sphincter, leading to incomplete bladder emptying and urinary retention, which can cause overflow incontinence. The absence of urge and the intermittent stream further support this diagnosis. Cognitive impairment and vesicovaginal fistula are unlikely given the presentation and history. Impaired detrusor contractility would typically present with different symptoms, such as a weak stream without the intermittent pattern seen here.",9
3845,"The patient's symptoms and biopsy findings are suggestive of tuberculosis (TB). The presence of caseating granulomas with multinucleated giant cells is characteristic of TB infection. The underlying immunological mechanism for the formation of these granulomas is a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, which is mediated by T cells, specifically CD4+ T helper 1 (Th1) cells. These cells release cytokines such as interferon-gamma, which activate macrophages to form granulomas in an attempt to contain the mycobacterial infection. This process is a classic example of a type IV hypersensitivity reaction, also known as a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction.",9
3842,"The clinical presentation and histopathological findings are suggestive of a pleomorphic adenoma, which is a common benign tumor of the salivary glands. The location at the angle of the jaw and the description of the mass as a well-circumscribed, encapsulated lesion with both epithelial and stromal components (myxoid and cartilaginous) are characteristic of pleomorphic adenoma. The transient hoarseness after surgery could be due to temporary nerve irritation or anesthesia effects, but it is not directly related to the mass's origin. The parotid gland is the most common site for pleomorphic adenomas, especially given the location near the angle of the jaw. Therefore, the mass most likely arose from the parotid gland.",9
3834,"The patient presents with fatigue and laboratory findings suggestive of microcytic anemia (low hemoglobin, low hematocrit, low MCV) with low ferritin levels, indicating iron deficiency anemia. In an elderly patient, iron deficiency anemia raises concern for potential gastrointestinal blood loss, often due to colorectal cancer or other gastrointestinal pathologies. Therefore, the next best step is to investigate the gastrointestinal tract for sources of bleeding. Colonoscopy is the appropriate diagnostic test to evaluate for colorectal cancer or other colonic sources of bleeding.",9
3825,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia. The key finding is the presence of peroxidase positive eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions, which are Auer rods, typically seen in APL. APL is associated with the t(15;17) translocation, resulting in the PML-RARA fusion protein. This fusion protein disrupts normal retinoic acid receptor function, which normally recruits histone acetylase proteins to promote transcription of genes necessary for myeloid differentiation. In APL, the PML-RARA fusion protein instead recruits histone deacetylases, leading to transcriptional repression and blocked differentiation. Therefore, the abnormal protein seen in this disease normally functions in recruiting histone acetylase proteins.",9
3855,"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are highly suggestive of acute appendicitis. The classic presentation includes right lower quadrant pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting. The physical exam finding described is Rovsing's sign, which is indicative of appendicitis. In cases where appendicitis is strongly suspected based on clinical presentation, the next step is often surgical intervention, especially if the diagnosis is clear and there is a risk of perforation. Imaging studies like an ultrasound or CT scan can be used to confirm the diagnosis, but in a clear-cut case, surgery is prioritized to prevent complications.",9
3850,"The question describes two types of vaccines: live attenuated vaccines and inactivated (killed) vaccines. Live attenuated vaccines induce both cellular and humoral immune responses, providing stronger and more lasting immunity. In contrast, inactivated vaccines primarily induce a humoral response and generally have less overall efficacy.

- **Yellow fever vaccine**: This is a live attenuated vaccine, which induces both cellular and humoral immunity.
- **Rabies vaccine**: This is an inactivated vaccine, which primarily induces a humoral response.
- **Hepatitis A vaccine**: This is an inactivated vaccine, which primarily induces a humoral response.
- **Polio vaccine (Salk)**: This is an inactivated vaccine, which primarily induces a humoral response.

Therefore, the yellow fever vaccine is the live attenuated vaccine that provides stronger and more lasting immunity by inducing both cellular and humoral immune responses.",9
3852,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of heart failure, specifically paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and frothy sputum, which are indicative of pulmonary congestion. The presence of bibasilar crackles and a low-pitched sound during late diastole (S4 gallop) suggests a problem with the heart's filling phase, rather than its pumping ability, as the ejection fraction is normal (55%). This points towards diastolic dysfunction, which is often due to impaired myocardial relaxation. The patient's history of hypertension is a common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy, leading to impaired relaxation. The arterial blood gas shows a respiratory alkalosis with metabolic compensation, likely due to hyperventilation from pulmonary congestion. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of the patient's condition is impaired myocardial relaxation, leading to diastolic heart failure.",9
3856,"The newborn presents with features suggestive of Down syndrome, such as a flat nasal bridge, protruding tongue, single palmar crease, and increased gap between the first and second toe. However, the karyotype shows 46 chromosomes, which is not typical for trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), where 47 chromosomes are expected due to an extra chromosome 21. This suggests a chromosomal abnormality other than simple trisomy. An unbalanced translocation could result in Down syndrome features with a normal chromosome count if part of chromosome 21 is translocated to another chromosome, leading to an extra dose of chromosome 21 material without an extra chromosome. This is consistent with the findings and explains the phenotype with a normal chromosome count.",9
3859,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with a sunburn, which is characterized by erythema, pain, and sometimes scaling after sun exposure. Sunburn is primarily caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which leads to direct DNA damage in skin cells. This damage results in apoptosis of keratinocytes in the epidermis, leading to the inflammatory response and the clinical presentation of sunburn. The other options describe mechanisms related to different dermatological conditions: immune complex deposits are associated with lupus, mast cell activation is related to urticaria, and T-cell-mediated reactions are seen in conditions like contact dermatitis.",9
3864,"The patient presents with sudden onset of severe chest pain, shortness of breath, and sweating, which are concerning for a cardiovascular emergency. His history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and smoking increases his risk for vascular diseases. The key findings include a diastolic murmur best heard over the right sternal border, which is suggestive of aortic regurgitation. This can occur due to aortic dissection, where the dissection flap can cause aortic valve insufficiency. The decreased femoral pulses bilaterally also suggest a vascular issue, such as aortic dissection, which can compromise blood flow to peripheral arteries. The ECG findings of sinus tachycardia and left ventricular hypertrophy are consistent with chronic hypertension but do not rule out acute aortic dissection. Pulmonary embolism and pneumothorax are less likely given the murmur and pulse findings. Papillary muscle rupture typically presents with acute mitral regurgitation and pulmonary edema, which are not present here. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is aortic dissection.",9
3865,"The key findings in this case are the black, discolored liver noted during surgery, the presence of scleral icterus for many years, and the laboratory results showing elevated direct bilirubin with normal liver enzymes. These findings suggest a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Dubin-Johnson syndrome is characterized by a defect in hepatic excretion of conjugated bilirubin, leading to conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and a black liver due to pigment deposition. The normal liver enzyme levels and the black liver are classic for Dubin-Johnson syndrome. Type II Crigler-Najjar syndrome and Rotor syndrome do not typically present with a black liver. Wilson disease involves copper accumulation and would present with different symptoms and lab findings.",9
3870,"The clinical presentation suggests a stroke in a child with a history of dactylitis, which is indicative of sickle cell disease. The acute neurological symptoms and MRI findings of cerebral infarction align with a sickle cell crisis leading to a stroke. In sickle cell disease, the most appropriate initial management for an acute stroke is exchange transfusion therapy. This treatment reduces the percentage of sickled cells, improves oxygen delivery, and decreases blood viscosity, thereby preventing further ischemic damage. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator is not typically used in children with sickle cell disease due to the risk of hemorrhage and lack of evidence for efficacy in this context. Hydroxyurea is used for long-term management to reduce the frequency of sickle cell crises but is not appropriate for acute stroke management. Aspirin is not the initial treatment for stroke in sickle cell disease.",9
3871,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a post-infectious complication. She had a sore throat a month ago, likely due to a streptococcal infection, which is a common precursor to acute rheumatic fever (ARF). The migratory arthritis (starting in the knees and moving to the ankles), fever, and cardiac involvement (evidenced by the pansystolic murmur, S3 and S4 sounds, and signs of heart failure such as dyspnea and edema) are classic signs of ARF. The pansystolic murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla suggests mitral regurgitation, which is commonly associated with ARF due to carditis affecting the mitral valve. The presence of an S3 gallop and signs of heart failure further support this diagnosis. The other options do not align as well with the migratory arthritis and recent history of sore throat.",9
3878,"The clinical presentation suggests coarctation of the aorta, characterized by a systolic ejection murmur and rib notching on chest x-ray due to collateral circulation. This condition can lead to hypertension in the upper body and decreased perfusion to the lower body. If left untreated, the increased blood pressure can cause complications such as intracranial hemorrhage due to the formation of berry aneurysms in the cerebral circulation. The other options are less directly related to the complications of coarctation of the aorta.",9
3860,"The newborn presents with respiratory distress, a harsh holosystolic murmur, and absence of bowel gas on abdominal x-ray. The presence of polyhydramnios during pregnancy and the absence of bowel gas suggest an esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF). The harsh holosystolic murmur could indicate a cardiac anomaly, which is common in VACTERL association, but the key findings here are related to TEF. Polyhydramnios occurs because the fetus cannot swallow amniotic fluid properly due to esophageal atresia. The absence of bowel gas is due to the lack of swallowed air reaching the intestines. TEF results from a defect in the development of the tracheoesophageal septum, which is a mesodermal structure. Thus, the pathogenesis is related to a defect in mesodermal differentiation.",9
3894,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of an epidural hematoma, which is characterized by a loss of consciousness followed by a lucid interval and then a decline in mental status. This type of hematoma is typically associated with a fracture of the temporal bone leading to rupture of the middle meningeal artery. The CT scan would likely show a biconvex (lens-shaped) hematoma. The middle meningeal artery is the structure most commonly affected in such cases.",9
3892,"The patient is likely suffering from hepatic encephalopathy, a condition often seen in individuals with chronic liver disease and alcohol abuse. This condition is caused by the accumulation of ammonia and other toxins in the blood due to impaired liver function. The treatment for hepatic encephalopathy often involves reducing the levels of ammonia in the blood. Lactulose is a common treatment used for this purpose. It works by acidifying the contents of the colon, which converts ammonia (NH3) into ammonium (NH4+), a form that is not absorbed and is excreted in the stool. This process effectively decreases the pH in the gastrointestinal lumen, which helps to reduce the systemic absorption of ammonia and improve the patient's mental status.",9
3896,"The patient's symptoms and signs are suggestive of Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by excess cortisol. The symptoms include weakness, decreased libido, weight gain, headaches, hypertension, hyperglycemia, abdominal striae, and muscle atrophy. The ECG finding of a small upward deflection after the T wave could indicate U waves, which are sometimes seen in hypokalemia, a condition that can occur in Cushing's syndrome due to mineralocorticoid effects of cortisol. The treatment that could prevent recurrence of these symptoms would be one that addresses the underlying cause of Cushing's syndrome. Eplerenone is a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist that can help manage hypertension and hypokalemia in Cushing's syndrome by counteracting the effects of excess cortisol. Therefore, eplerenone could help prevent the patient from presenting again with similar symptoms.",9
3898,"The patient has osteoporosis as indicated by the T-score of -3.0. Her laboratory values are normal, and she smokes, which is a risk factor for osteoporosis. To reduce the risk of osteoporosis, lifestyle modifications are important. 

Option A is incorrect because reduced physical activity can actually worsen bone density. Weight-bearing exercises are beneficial for bone health.

Option B is incorrect because swimming is not a weight-bearing exercise and does not significantly improve bone density.

Option C is correct because calcium and vitamin D supplementation can help maintain bone density and reduce the risk of osteoporosis.

Option D is incorrect because weight loss can lead to decreased bone density unless it is done in a controlled manner with adequate nutrition and exercise.

Therefore, the best measure to reduce the risk of osteoporosis in this patient would have been calcium and vitamin D supplementation.",9
3903,"The patient presents with acute neurological deficits (weakness in the left arm and leg, hyperreflexia, and a positive Babinski sign on the left), suggesting a stroke. She also has signs of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right leg (swelling, erythema, tenderness), which is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism. Her recent travel and use of oral contraceptives increase her risk for DVT. The combination of a DVT and a stroke suggests a paradoxical embolism, where a clot travels from the venous system to the arterial system. This can occur through a patent foramen ovale (PFO), which allows a clot to bypass the lungs and enter systemic circulation, potentially causing a stroke. The other options are less likely given the presentation: a ventricular septal defect is less commonly associated with paradoxical embolism, carotid artery dissection would not explain the DVT, and atrial fibrillation is not indicated by the regular pulse and would not explain the DVT.",9
3905,"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of Cushing's syndrome, characterized by excess cortisol production. The key features include central obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, skin changes (such as thin, easily bruisable skin and striae), and muscle weakness. The darkening of mucous membranes and skin creases suggests increased ACTH production, which is consistent with Cushing's disease (pituitary adenoma causing excess ACTH production). Imaging in Cushing's disease typically reveals a pituitary microadenoma.",9
3909,"In this scenario, the mother has HIV and received antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy, but her viral load was not fully suppressed (678 copies/mL) close to delivery. The newborn is at risk for HIV transmission. The standard prophylactic treatment for newborns at risk of HIV transmission from mothers with detectable viral loads is to administer zidovudine (AZT) to the infant. This is typically started within 6-12 hours after birth and continued for 4-6 weeks. Additional antiretrovirals may be considered if the mother's viral load is high or if there are other risk factors, but in this case, zidovudine alone is the most appropriate initial step.",9
3910,"The patient's history and family background suggest a hereditary cancer syndrome. She had osteosarcoma at a young age, and her father died of adrenocortical carcinoma, both of which are associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Li-Fraumeni syndrome is caused by mutations in the TP53 gene. This syndrome is characterized by a predisposition to several types of cancer, including breast cancer, sarcomas, brain tumors, and adrenocortical carcinoma. Given the patient's history and the types of cancers involved, a defect in the TP53 gene is most likely.",9
3848,"The patient presents with symptoms of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following a long flight, alongside a history of DVT in the past. His mother had a history of pulmonary embolus while pregnant, suggesting a possible inherited thrombophilia. The patient's lack of symptoms like fever, weight loss, or night sweats makes malignancy less immediately likely, although not impossible. Protein C deficiency and antithrombin III deficiency are inherited conditions that can lead to thrombosis, but the history presented aligns most closely with a hereditary hypercoagulable condition, specifically Factor V Leiden mutation. This mutation causes resistance to inactivation by activated protein C, leading to a higher risk of clotting. The patient's family history of clotting disorders further supports this explanation. Therefore, the most likely cause is resistance of factor V to inactivation by protein C, which is consistent with Factor V Leiden mutation.",9
3920,"The patient presents with a hypopigmented skin lesion with decreased sensation, fever, fatigue, and malaise. The lesion appeared after a cut that he did not feel, suggesting nerve involvement. The hypopigmented macule with raised borders and sensory loss is characteristic of leprosy, caused by Mycobacterium leprae. This condition is endemic in some parts of India, which aligns with the patient's history of immigration from India. The other options do not fit the clinical presentation: Epidermophyton floccosum causes dermatophytosis, which does not typically cause sensory loss; Leishmania donovani causes visceral leishmaniasis, not skin lesions with sensory loss; Malassezia furfur causes tinea versicolor, which also does not cause sensory loss.",9
3921,"The patient presents with a diabetic foot ulcer complicated by infection, as indicated by the malodorous ulcer, erythema, and systemic signs such as fever and tachycardia. In such cases, the best initial step is to start antibiotics and provide supportive care to address the infection and prevent further complications. Superficial swabs are not useful for deep infections, endovascular intervention is not indicated here, and minor amputation is not the first step without attempting to control the infection.",9
3925,"The clinical presentation of the 2-year-old boy includes poor weight gain, easy fatigability, and a holosystolic murmur loudest at the left lower sternal border. These symptoms suggest a cardiac issue causing increased pulmonary blood flow and possibly heart failure symptoms. The holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border is characteristic of a ventricular septal defect (VSD). In VSD, blood flows from the left ventricle to the right ventricle during systole, leading to increased pulmonary circulation and symptoms like poor weight gain and easy fatigability due to heart failure. The absence of cyanosis and clubbing also supports VSD over other cyanotic heart defects like Tetralogy of Fallot. An atrial septal defect (ASD) typically presents with a systolic ejection murmur and fixed splitting of the second heart sound, not a holosystolic murmur. Coarctation of the aorta would present with differential blood pressures in the upper and lower extremities and not typically with a holosystolic murmur. Tetralogy of Fallot would present with cyanosis and a different type of murmur. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is VSD.",9
3935,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder, including low mood, anhedonia, fatigue, and weight loss. The drug prescribed is noted to be cardiotoxic and may result in ECG changes, which is characteristic of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). TCAs are known for their potential cardiotoxicity, including causing arrhythmias and changes in the ECG, such as prolonged QT interval. The mechanism of action of TCAs is the inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin at the presynaptic terminal, increasing their concentration in the synaptic cleft. Therefore, the mechanism of action of the drug most likely prescribed to this patient is the inhibition of the uptake of serotonin and norepinephrine.",9
3936,"The patient presents with abdominal pain after meals, black stools (melena), weight loss, fever, and a skin rash. His lab results show elevated creatinine, indicating possible renal involvement, and positive serology for acute hepatitis B infection (HBsAg positive, IgM anti-HBc positive). The symptoms and lab findings suggest a systemic vasculitis, particularly polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), which is associated with hepatitis B infection. PAN can cause mesenteric ischemia leading to abdominal pain and melena, renal involvement causing elevated creatinine, and skin manifestations. The expected finding in PAN is segmental ischemic necrosis of various ages at the mesenteric arteries.",9
3934,"The patient presents with sudden, painless loss of vision in one eye, which is a classic presentation for central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). The history of transient vision loss (amaurosis fugax) a month ago suggests a vascular etiology, likely embolic. The relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) observed (pupillary dilation when light is shone in the affected eye) supports significant retinal or optic nerve dysfunction, consistent with CRAO. The patient's risk factors, including ischemic heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking, further support a vascular cause. Temporal arteritis is less likely given the absence of headache or musculoskeletal pain, and the patient's age and risk factors do not align with demyelinating optic neuritis or wet macular degeneration, which typically presents with central vision distortion rather than sudden complete vision loss.",9
3939,"The symptoms described in the vignette are characteristic of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, a disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). This deficiency leads to an overproduction of uric acid, which explains the orange, sandy residues in the diapers (uric acid crystals). The self-mutilating behavior, such as biting fingers and toes, is also a hallmark of this condition. 

The pharmacotherapy for managing the hyperuricemia in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is allopurinol, which inhibits xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase is responsible for the conversion of xanthine to urate (uric acid). By inhibiting this enzyme, allopurinol reduces the production of uric acid, thereby alleviating some of the symptoms associated with the condition.

Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition inhibits the conversion of xanthine to urate.",9
3941,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of Boerhaave syndrome, which is a spontaneous esophageal rupture often following episodes of vomiting. The key findings supporting this diagnosis include severe retrosternal pain radiating to the back, history of vomiting, subcutaneous emphysema (crepitus over the thorax), and signs of shock (hypotension and tachycardia). The decreased breath sounds over the left base could indicate pleural effusion or pneumothorax secondary to esophageal rupture. The laboratory findings show metabolic alkalosis, which is consistent with vomiting. To confirm the diagnosis of esophageal rupture, a CT scan of the chest is the most appropriate test as it can reveal pneumomediastinum, pleural effusion, and other signs of esophageal perforation.",9
3938,"The patient has a distal radius fracture and a DEXA scan showing a T-score of -3.5, indicating severe osteoporosis. In managing her hypertension, it would be beneficial to choose an antihypertensive that also has a positive effect on bone health. Hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, is known to reduce urinary calcium excretion and can help increase bone mineral density, making it a preferred choice for patients with osteoporosis. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, can increase calcium excretion and potentially worsen bone density. Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, and amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, do not have significant effects on bone density. Therefore, hydrochlorothiazide is the preferred antihypertensive agent in this patient.",9
3944,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of lumbar radiculopathy, likely due to a herniated disc, given the acute onset of back pain radiating down the legs after lifting a heavy object. The neurological examination shows weakness in foot dorsiflexion and diminished sensation, which are consistent with nerve root compression. The straight leg raise test is positive, further supporting this diagnosis. In such cases, imaging of the lumbar spine, particularly an MRI, is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of nerve root involvement.",9
3943,"The patient presents with migratory polyarthritis, tenosynovitis (tender Achilles tendon), and vesicopustular skin lesions. These symptoms are characteristic of disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI). The synovial fluid analysis shows a high leukocyte count with neutrophil predominance, which is consistent with an inflammatory process such as DGI. The negative Gram stain does not rule out gonococcal infection, as Neisseria gonorrhoeae can be difficult to detect on Gram stain. The patient's sexual history with multiple partners increases the risk for sexually transmitted infections, including gonorrhea. Dermatitis herpetiformis is associated with celiac disease but presents with pruritic vesicular rash, not joint symptoms. Lyme disease could cause arthritis but typically presents with a history of tick exposure and erythema migrans rash, and the synovial fluid findings are less inflammatory. Reactive arthritis could present similarly but is less likely given the skin lesions and migratory nature of the arthritis.",9
3893,,0
3956,"The patient presents with altered mental status, metabolic acidosis (low bicarbonate and low pH), elevated osmolality with an osmolal gap (measured osmolality is higher than calculated), and the presence of oxalate crystals in the urine. These findings are suggestive of ethylene glycol poisoning. Ethylene glycol is metabolized to glycolic acid and oxalic acid, which cause metabolic acidosis and renal damage, respectively. The presence of oxalate crystals in the urine is a classic finding in ethylene glycol toxicity. The appropriate treatment for ethylene glycol poisoning is to inhibit alcohol dehydrogenase, the enzyme responsible for converting ethylene glycol to its toxic metabolites. Fomepizole is a competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase and is the preferred treatment for ethylene glycol poisoning.",10
3959,"The patient's symptoms of fatigue, constipation, weight gain, bradycardia, and dry skin are suggestive of hypothyroidism. The most common cause of hypothyroidism in adults is Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which is an autoimmune condition. In Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the immune system attacks the thyroid gland, leading to decreased production of thyroid hormones. This autoimmune attack on the thyroid gland results in the symptoms observed in this patient. The other options do not fit the clinical picture: chronic blood loss would typically cause anemia, iatrogenesis refers to a condition caused by medical treatment, and nutritional deficiency (such as iodine deficiency) is less common in developed countries.",9
3963,"The clinical presentation of bilious vomiting, abdominal distention, delayed passage of meconium, and an empty rectum on digital examination is suggestive of Hirschsprung disease. This condition is caused by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal colon due to defective migration of neural crest cells during embryonic development. The lack of ganglion cells leads to a functional obstruction because the affected segment cannot relax, resulting in the symptoms observed. The x-ray would typically show a dilated proximal colon and a narrow distal segment, consistent with this diagnosis.",9
3960,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), including fever, cough with sputum production, and crackles on lung auscultation. Her vital signs indicate tachycardia, tachypnea, and fever, but her oxygen saturation is relatively preserved at 94% on room air. The leukocytosis and elevated ESR support an inflammatory process, likely infectious. Given her age, comorbidities (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes), and smoking history, she is at increased risk for complications from pneumonia. The most appropriate management for a patient with CAP who has comorbidities and requires hospitalization is inpatient treatment with a combination of a beta-lactam (such as ceftriaxone) and a macrolide (such as azithromycin) to cover typical and atypical pathogens. Therefore, the best choice is inpatient treatment with azithromycin and ceftriaxone.",9
3961,"The patient presents with hypercalcemia (serum calcium of 13.8 mg/dL), renal impairment (creatinine of 2.1 mg/dL), anemia (hemoglobin of 9.3 g/dL), and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR of 65 mm/h). These findings are suggestive of multiple myeloma, a condition characterized by the overproliferation of plasma cells. Multiple myeloma can cause hypercalcemia due to osteolytic bone lesions, renal impairment due to light chain deposition, and anemia due to bone marrow infiltration. The elevated ESR is also consistent with multiple myeloma due to increased production of monoclonal proteins. The patient's symptoms of confusion, nausea, and polyuria are consistent with hypercalcemia. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is overproliferation of plasma cells.",9
3967,"The infant's laboratory values show elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, indicating polycythemia. Polycythemia in newborns can be caused by several factors, including maternal conditions. In this case, the mother has hypertension (167/102 mmHg), which can lead to uteroplacental insufficiency. Uteroplacental insufficiency can cause fetal hypoxia, leading to increased erythropoiesis and resultant polycythemia in the newborn. While maternal diabetes can also cause polycythemia, it is typically associated with poorly controlled diabetes, which is not the case here as the mother's diabetes is well-controlled. The gestational age of 36 weeks and Caesarean section delivery are less likely to be directly associated with polycythemia. Therefore, the most likely cause of the infant's polycythemia is maternal hypertension.",9
3969,"The patient is likely experiencing opioid overdose, as suggested by the presence of syringes, miosis (pupil constriction), and respiratory depression. The reversal agent for opioid overdose is naloxone, which is an opioid receptor antagonist. Naloxone works by competitively inhibiting opioid receptors, reversing the effects of opioids. One of the known effects of naloxone is that it can precipitate acute withdrawal symptoms in individuals who are opioid-dependent. This is because it rapidly displaces opioids from their receptors, leading to a sudden cessation of opioid effects. Therefore, the most accurate statement regarding naloxone is that it results in acute withdrawal.",9
3978,"The patient is experiencing difficulty falling asleep and daytime fatigue, likely related to recent stress from losing her job. She denies symptoms of depression such as mood changes, weight loss, or anhedonia, which suggests that her primary issue is insomnia rather than a mood disorder. Zolpidem is a medication specifically used for short-term treatment of insomnia and would be appropriate for helping her fall asleep. Quetiapine is an antipsychotic that can be sedating but is not typically used for primary insomnia. Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine with sedative properties but can cause anticholinergic side effects and is not recommended for long-term use. Citalopram is an SSRI used for depression and anxiety, which she does not appear to have. Therefore, Zolpidem is the most appropriate choice for her current symptoms.",9
3980,"The patient's symptoms of heat intolerance, unintentional weight loss, tachycardia, and tremor suggest hyperthyroidism. In hyperthyroidism, the thyroid gland produces excessive amounts of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4), leading to increased metabolic activity. The feedback mechanism in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis results in decreased secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the pituitary gland due to the high levels of circulating thyroid hormones. Therefore, in this patient with suspected hyperthyroidism, the laboratory value most likely to be low is TSH.",9
3979,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a life-threatening condition often associated with the use of antipsychotic medications. The key features include hyperthermia, autonomic instability (elevated heart rate and blood pressure), altered mental status, and muscle rigidity. The elevated white blood cell count and significantly increased creatine kinase level further support this diagnosis, indicating muscle breakdown. The recent increase in his antipsychotic medication dose is a common precipitating factor for NMS. The best treatment for NMS involves supportive care and the use of medications such as dantrolene or bromocriptine. Dantrolene is a muscle relaxant that helps reduce muscle rigidity and hyperthermia, making it the best choice in this scenario.",9
3981,"The patient initially presents with symptoms suggestive of acute appendicitis, including right lower quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis. The decision to treat with antibiotics and defer surgery suggests a conservative management approach, possibly due to a complicated appendicitis. Two days later, the development of hepatic abscesses is noted on CT scan. This finding is indicative of a septic process that has spread to the liver. Pylephlebitis, or septic thrombophlebitis of the portal vein, is a known complication of appendicitis that can lead to the formation of hepatic abscesses due to the spread of infection via the portal venous system. The leukocytosis with a left shift supports an ongoing infectious process. Other options like intestinal obstruction, perforation, or appendiceal abscess would not typically lead to hepatic abscesses. Therefore, the most likely complication in this scenario is pylephlebitis.",9
3983,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of warfarin-induced skin necrosis, which is a known complication that can occur shortly after starting warfarin therapy. This condition is associated with a deficiency of protein C, a natural anticoagulant. When warfarin is initiated, it reduces the levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, including protein C. In individuals with an underlying deficiency of protein C, this reduction can lead to a hypercoagulable state, resulting in thrombosis of small vessels and subsequent skin necrosis. The timeline of starting a new medication for atrial fibrillation and the development of skin lesions aligns with the initiation of warfarin therapy. Therefore, the strongest predisposing factor for this condition is a deficiency of a natural anticoagulant, specifically protein C.",9
3949,,0
3987,"The patient presents with microcytic anemia (low hemoglobin and low MCV), positive fecal occult blood, and a mass in the cecum with liver lesions, suggesting colorectal cancer with possible liver metastases. The cecum is part of the large intestine and is supplied by the superior mesenteric artery and drained by the superior mesenteric vein. The superior mesenteric vein drains blood from the small intestine, cecum, ascending colon, and part of the transverse colon. Given the location of the mass in the cecum, the superior mesenteric vein is the structure most at risk for involvement in this disease process.",9
3986,"The clinical presentation of the 10-year-old boy suggests post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). The key features include recent history of a sore throat (likely streptococcal infection), periorbital edema, and dark urine, which may indicate hematuria. PSGN typically occurs after a streptococcal infection and is characterized by the presence of sub-epithelial electron dense deposits, known as ""humps,"" on electron microscopy. These deposits are composed of immune complexes. The other options are associated with different conditions: linear Ig deposits are seen in Goodpasture syndrome, no abnormalities might be seen in minimal change disease on light microscopy, and podocyte fusion is characteristic of minimal change disease on electron microscopy.",9
3990,"The patient presents with symptoms of fatigue, headaches, diplopia, and visual field defects, which suggest a mass effect in the sellar region. The CT scan shows suprasellar calcifications, which are characteristic of a craniopharyngioma. Additionally, the laboratory findings show low TSH and low free T4, indicating central hypothyroidism, which can occur due to pituitary or hypothalamic dysfunction. The weight gain and slow reflexes are consistent with hypothyroidism. Craniopharyngiomas are known to cause these symptoms due to their location near the pituitary gland and hypothalamus, leading to hormonal imbalances and visual disturbances. The presence of calcifications on imaging strongly points towards craniopharyngioma rather than a pituitary adenoma, which typically does not calcify.",9
3991,"The clinical presentation of the patient suggests a drug overdose, characterized by decreased respiratory rate (respiratory depression), decreased level of consciousness, and low oxygen saturation. These symptoms are classic for opioid overdose, which causes central nervous system depression and respiratory depression. Among the options provided, opioid analgesics (A) and heroin (B) are both opioids, but heroin is a specific type of opioid. Statistically, opioid analgesics, which include prescription medications like oxycodone, hydrocodone, and morphine, are more commonly associated with overdose deaths than heroin. Antidepressants (C) and acetaminophen (D) can also cause overdose, but their clinical presentations differ, with antidepressants potentially causing cardiac arrhythmias or seizures and acetaminophen leading to liver failure. Given the respiratory depression and the statistical likelihood, opioid analgesics are the most common cause of overdose deaths.",9
3992,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of acute pyelonephritis, likely complicated by her history of recurrent UTIs and diabetes mellitus. The presence of fever, chills, dysuria, and costovertebral angle tenderness, along with positive nitrites and leukocyte esterase in the urinalysis, supports this diagnosis. Given her high fever and systemic symptoms, she requires prompt treatment. While imaging studies like renal ultrasound can be useful in certain cases to rule out complications like abscess or obstruction, the immediate priority is to start appropriate antibiotic therapy to manage the infection. Therefore, the best next step is to admit the patient for intravenous antibiotic therapy to address the acute infection and prevent further complications.",9
3993,"The patient's symptoms and clinical findings are suggestive of a demyelinating disorder. She presents with progressive vision loss and periorbital pain, which are characteristic of optic neuritis, a common initial presentation of multiple sclerosis (MS). Additionally, she has neurological symptoms such as weakness, numbness, and tingling in her left leg, along with gait imbalance, positive Babinski reflexes, bilateral spasticity, and exaggerated deep tendon reflexes, indicating upper motor neuron involvement. These findings are consistent with MS, which is known for causing lesions in the central nervous system that can lead to such symptoms. The FLAIR MRI would likely show demyelinating plaques, which are typical in MS. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is less likely given the age and presentation, as it typically follows an infection or vaccination and is more common in children. CADASIL and lead intoxication do not fit the clinical picture as well as MS does. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is multiple sclerosis.",9
3994,"The clinical presentation suggests a glycogen storage disease. The key findings are hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, and a storage molecule with abnormally short outer chains. This description is characteristic of a defect in the debranching enzyme, which is responsible for breaking down glycogen. In the absence of this enzyme, glycogen accumulates with short outer chains, leading to the symptoms observed. This condition is known as Glycogen Storage Disease Type III (Cori disease).",9
3995,"The scenario describes a situation where initially all Enterococcus faecalis colonies are resistant to vancomycin, but after 15 generations in a vancomycin-free environment, 20% of the colonies become sensitive. This suggests that the resistance mechanism is not stable in the absence of selective pressure (vancomycin). 

Vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus is often mediated by genes carried on plasmids. Plasmids are extrachromosomal DNA that can be lost over generations, especially when there is no selective pressure to maintain them. In this case, the absence of vancomycin in the culture medium removes the selective pressure to retain the plasmid, leading to plasmid loss in some of the bacterial population. This would result in a portion of the bacteria becoming sensitive to vancomycin again.

Point mutations and loss of function mutations are less likely because they would not typically revert to sensitivity in a significant portion of the population without selective pressure. Viral infection is also unlikely to explain the loss of resistance.

Therefore, the most likely explanation for the observed phenomenon is plasmid loss.",9
4006,"The patient's presentation with progressive shortness of breath, cough, and chest X-ray findings of prominent hilar lymph nodes and scattered nodular infiltrates, along with biopsy showing noncaseating granulomas, is suggestive of a condition similar to sarcoidosis. However, in the context of occupational exposure, these findings are characteristic of chronic beryllium disease (berylliosis). Berylliosis is caused by exposure to beryllium, a metal used in various industries. The presence of noncaseating granulomas is a key feature that distinguishes it from other pneumoconioses such as those caused by coal dust or silica, which typically do not present with noncaseating granulomas.",9
4003,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with Graves' disease, an autoimmune hyperthyroid condition characterized by the presence of antibodies against the thyrotropin receptor, undetectable TSH, and diffusely increased iodine uptake on thyroid scintigraphy. The treatment of choice for Graves' disease in many cases is radioactive iodine therapy, which the patient has received. Radioactive iodine ablates the thyroid tissue, leading to a reduction in thyroid hormone production. However, this often results in hypothyroidism, necessitating long-term thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Therefore, after radioactive iodine treatment, the patient will most likely require L-thyroxine therapy to manage the resultant hypothyroidism.",9

4007,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of anticholinergic toxicity. Key features include confusion, warm and flushed skin, dry skin, dilated pupils, and tachycardia. Anticholinergic toxicity is characterized by the mnemonic ""hot as a hare, dry as a bone, red as a beet, mad as a hatter, blind as a bat,"" which describes hyperthermia, dry skin, flushing, confusion, and mydriasis. Additionally, anticholinergic effects include urinary retention due to relaxation of the detrusor muscle and contraction of the internal sphincter. Therefore, urinary retention is likely to be found in this patient.",9
4008,"The patient's symptoms and pulmonary function test results suggest a restrictive lung disease, as indicated by the normal or increased FEV1/FVC ratio and reduced FVC. The chronic non-productive cough, dyspnea, and late inspiratory crackles are consistent with interstitial lung disease, particularly idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In IPF, lung biopsy typically shows usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern, which is characterized by subpleural cystic enlargement, also known as honeycombing. This is the most likely finding on lung biopsy given the clinical presentation and test results.",9
4009,"Vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus species, such as Enterococcus faecalis, is primarily due to the alteration of the target site of the antibiotic. Vancomycin normally binds to the D-alanyl-D-alanine terminus of the peptidoglycan precursors in the bacterial cell wall, inhibiting cell wall synthesis. In vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), the terminal D-alanine is replaced by D-lactate, which reduces the binding affinity of vancomycin, leading to resistance. This mechanism is well-documented and is the primary cause of vancomycin resistance in these bacteria.",9
4016,"The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a blood pH of 7.52, which indicates alkalosis (normal pH is 7.35-7.45). The PaCO2 is 28 mm Hg, which is lower than the normal range (35-45 mm Hg), suggesting that the alkalosis is due to a respiratory cause (hyperventilation leading to decreased CO2). The HCO3- is 21 mEq/L, which is slightly lower than normal (22-26 mEq/L), indicating a compensatory metabolic acidosis. However, the primary disturbance is respiratory because the pH is alkalotic and the PaCO2 is low. Therefore, the acid-base disturbance is best characterized as respiratory alkalosis.",9
4011,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with type 2 diabetes mellitus, including increased thirst, polyuria, decreased vision, and peripheral neuropathy. The HbA1c level of 8.5% confirms poor glycemic control. The first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes is metformin, which is known to have a risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients with renal impairment. This patient has stage 2 chronic kidney disease with an eGFR of 55 mL/min, which increases the risk of lactic acidosis when using metformin. Therefore, the side effect associated with metformin, the first-line drug for this condition, is lactic acidosis.",9
4013,"The patient has a kidney stone, and the x-ray shows an 8-mm stone. The most common type of kidney stone is calcium oxalate. To prevent the formation of calcium oxalate stones, dietary modifications are often recommended. A low-calcium diet is not advised because it can lead to increased oxalate absorption in the gut, which can increase stone formation. A high-oxalate diet would increase the risk of stone formation, so it should be avoided. Vitamin C supplementation can increase oxalate levels in the urine, so it should also be avoided. A low-protein diet can help reduce the risk of stone formation by decreasing calcium and uric acid excretion in the urine. Therefore, a low-protein diet is the most appropriate dietary advice for this patient.",9
4022,"The serologic markers provided in the question help identify the type of viral hepatitis the patient is experiencing. The presence of HBsAg (Hepatitis B surface antigen) indicates an active Hepatitis B infection. The presence of IgM anti-HBc (IgM antibody to Hepatitis B core antigen) suggests an acute or recent infection with Hepatitis B. The absence of Anti-HBs (antibody to Hepatitis B surface antigen) indicates that the patient has not yet developed immunity to Hepatitis B, which would occur after recovery or vaccination. The negative Anti-HAV IgM, Anti-HCV, and Anti-HDV indicate that the patient does not have acute Hepatitis A, C, or D. Therefore, the serologic pattern is consistent with an acute Hepatitis B infection.",9
4023,"The key points in this scenario are the male partner's infertility due to dysfunctional sperm, frequent sinus and lung infections, and an abnormal finding on palpation of the right fifth intercostal space at the midclavicular line. This abnormal finding suggests situs inversus, where the heart and possibly other organs are on the opposite side of the body. The combination of situs inversus, recurrent respiratory infections, and infertility due to dysfunctional sperm is characteristic of Kartagener syndrome, which is a subset of primary ciliary dyskinesia. This condition is caused by defects in the cilia, leading to impaired mucociliary clearance in the respiratory tract and impaired motility of sperm, resulting in infertility.",9
4026,"The patient's symptoms of daytime drowsiness, fatigue, impaired memory, weight gain, bradycardia (pulse 58/min), and slightly dry skin suggest hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is often associated with metabolic changes, including hypercholesterolemia, due to decreased metabolism. The other options, such as anxiety, palpitations, and tremor, are more commonly associated with hyperthyroidism, not hypothyroidism.",9
4024,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with hemorrhoids. He reports painless rectal bleeding with bright red blood on the toilet paper and in the toilet bowl, which is typical of hemorrhoids. The 'uncomfortable lump' that resolves on its own suggests prolapse that reduces spontaneously, which is characteristic of Grade 2 hemorrhoids. Anoscopy reveals enlarged blood vessels above the pectinate line, indicating internal hemorrhoids. External hemorrhoids would be below the pectinate line. Therefore, the most likely cause is Grade 2 internal hemorrhoids.",9
4029,"The patient presents with symptoms of bradycardia (pulse of 37/min) and hypotension (blood pressure of 92/50 mm Hg), along with a recent syncopal episode. These findings suggest a hemodynamically unstable bradycardia. The most common initial treatment for symptomatic bradycardia is the administration of atropine, which is an anticholinergic agent that can increase heart rate by blocking vagal effects on the heart. If atropine is ineffective, other interventions such as transcutaneous pacing or administration of dopamine or epinephrine may be considered. However, the first-line treatment in this scenario is atropine.",9
4030,"The patient presents with shortness of breath and chest pain shortly after a recent surgery, which increases the risk of thromboembolic events. He has a history of deep vein thrombosis, further increasing his risk for pulmonary embolism. The vital signs show tachycardia and tachypnea, which are consistent with pulmonary embolism. The normal chest radiography helps rule out pneumonia and exacerbation of chronic lung disease. The lack of fever and expectoration also makes pneumonia less likely. While myocardial infarction could present similarly, the recent surgery and history of DVT make pulmonary embolism the most likely diagnosis.",9
4034,"The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), given the sudden-onset severe headache (often described as a ""thunderclap headache""), nausea, vomiting, and neck stiffness. The history of hypertension and smoking are risk factors for SAH, likely due to a ruptured cerebral aneurysm. The CT scan of the head would typically show blood in the subarachnoid space if SAH is present. The positive Brudzinski sign (flexing hips and knees when the neck is flexed) indicates meningeal irritation, consistent with SAH. The most appropriate intervention for a ruptured cerebral aneurysm causing SAH is surgical clipping or endovascular coiling to prevent rebleeding. Therefore, the most appropriate intervention is surgical clipping.",9
4038,"The clinical presentation of the 18-month-old girl includes wheezing, runny nose, cough, fever, and intercostal retractions. These symptoms, along with the age of the child, are highly suggestive of bronchiolitis, which is commonly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants and young children. Bronchiolitis typically presents with wheezing and respiratory distress in children under 2 years of age. The presence of bilateral fine rales and diffuse wheezing further supports this diagnosis. Bronchial asthma is less likely given the age and first-time presentation. Bacterial pneumonia would more likely present with focal findings on auscultation and possibly a higher fever. A bronchial foreign body would typically present with sudden onset of respiratory distress and possibly asymmetric breath sounds.",9
4043,"The patient's presentation is consistent with dermatitis herpetiformis, which is characterized by intensely pruritic vesicles and excoriations, often on extensor surfaces like the elbows and knees. The presence of IgA deposits at the tips of dermal papillae on immunofluorescence is a classic finding. Dermatitis herpetiformis is associated with celiac disease, which involves a hypersensitivity to gliadin, a component of gluten. Therefore, the skin findings are associated with gliadin-dependent hypersensitivity.",9
4031,"The patient presents with a sharply demarcated area of skin dryness and erythema encircling her left wrist. Given her history of asthma and allergies, she is predisposed to atopic conditions. However, atopic dermatitis typically presents with more diffuse, less well-demarcated lesions and is often found in flexural areas. Psoriasis usually presents with well-demarcated plaques with silvery scales, often on extensor surfaces, and scabies would present with intense itching and burrows, typically in web spaces or on the trunk. The sharply demarcated nature of the rash and its location suggest an external irritant or allergen, consistent with contact dermatitis, which often presents as a localized rash in areas exposed to an irritant or allergen.",9
4046,"The patient's symptoms and the positive Finkelstein's test (pain with thumb flexion and ulnar deviation of the wrist) are indicative of De Quervain's tenosynovitis. This condition is common in new mothers due to repetitive lifting of the newborn. The best initial management for De Quervain's tenosynovitis involves conservative measures, including rest and NSAIDs like ibuprofen to reduce inflammation and pain. Immobilization with a thumb spica splint can also be considered, but the question asks for the best next step, which is typically rest and NSAIDs.",9
4068,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a condition associated with immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with HIV and low CD4 counts. The key symptoms include clumsiness, weakness, speech difficulties, and visual changes. These are indicative of a central nervous system disorder. Given the patient's low CD4 count and neurological symptoms, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a likely diagnosis. PML is caused by the JC virus, which is a type of Polyomavirus. This virus reactivates in immunocompromised individuals, leading to demyelination in the brain and the symptoms observed in this patient.",9
4059,"The patient presents with severe, episodic back pain radiating to the groin, hematuria, and a 5-mm stone in the left ureter, which are classic signs of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones). The urinalysis shows envelope-shaped crystals, which are indicative of calcium oxalate stones. In this patient, Crohn disease is a significant risk factor for calcium oxalate stones. Crohn disease can lead to fat malabsorption, which increases the absorption of oxalate in the gut, leading to hyperoxaluria and the formation of calcium oxalate stones. While gout and medications like allopurinol could contribute to uric acid stones, the presence of envelope-shaped crystals specifically points to calcium oxalate stones. Diabetes mellitus is not directly associated with calcium oxalate stones. Therefore, Crohn disease is the most likely contributor to the development of the patient's symptoms.",9
4052,"The mother had a thyroidectomy for Graves disease, which suggests she had hyperthyroidism. If she was not adequately managed during pregnancy, the fetus could be affected by maternal thyroid antibodies, leading to neonatal thyrotoxicosis. The fetal heart rate of 180 bpm is tachycardic, which is consistent with hyperthyroidism. Additionally, the lack of a sagittal cranial suture could be related to craniosynostosis, which can be associated with hyperthyroidism. Therefore, the baby is likely to have high levels of thyroid hormones due to transplacental passage of thyroid-stimulating antibodies.",9
4071,"The patient presents with hypotension and tachycardia, which initially improves with fluid resuscitation. However, after starting treatment including beta-blockers, nitroglycerin, and other medications, the blood pressure drops again. Beta-blockers can cause hypotension by decreasing heart rate and contractility, but the more likely cause here is the administration of nitroglycerin. Nitroglycerin works by increasing cGMP, leading to vasodilation and a decrease in preload and afterload, which can cause hypotension, especially in a patient who is already volume-depleted or has compromised cardiac function. The drop in blood pressure after nitroglycerin administration suggests that the vasodilatory effect is the primary cause of the hypotension.",9
4051,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of an aortic dissection, given the sudden onset of chest pain radiating to the back and the presence of hypertension. The physical exam reveals an S4 heart sound, which can be associated with left ventricular hypertrophy due to chronic hypertension. The patient's blood pressure is significantly elevated, which needs to be managed. In the context of a suspected aortic dissection, the immediate management involves controlling the blood pressure to prevent further dissection. Labetalol is a beta-blocker that can reduce both heart rate and blood pressure, making it the preferred choice in this scenario. Nitroprusside is also used to lower blood pressure but is typically used after beta-blockade to avoid reflex tachycardia. A CT scan is necessary for diagnosis, but the immediate management of blood pressure takes precedence. NPO, IV fluids, and serum lipase are more relevant for pancreatitis, which is less likely given the presentation.",9
4074,"The patient presents with symptoms and ECG findings consistent with atrial fibrillation (AF), which is characterized by an irregularly irregular pulse and absence of P waves. In patients with AF, there is an increased risk of embolic stroke due to the formation of thrombi in the left atrium. Long-term prevention of embolic stroke in AF typically involves anticoagulation therapy.

The options provided describe different mechanisms of action for anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs:

A. Binding and activation of antithrombin III - This describes the mechanism of action of heparin, which is used for anticoagulation but not typically for long-term stroke prevention in AF.

B. Irreversible inhibition of cyclooxygenase - This describes the mechanism of action of aspirin, an antiplatelet agent, which is not sufficient for stroke prevention in AF.

C. Interference with carboxylation of glutamate residues - This describes the mechanism of action of warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, which is used for long-term anticoagulation in AF to prevent embolic stroke.

D. Irreversible blockade of adenosine diphosphate receptors - This describes the mechanism of action of clopidogrel, an antiplatelet agent, which is not typically used alone for stroke prevention in AF.

Given the need for anticoagulation in AF to prevent embolic stroke, the correct choice is C, which describes warfarin.",9
4088,"The patient's symptoms and sigmoidoscopy findings are suggestive of ulcerative colitis (UC), a form of inflammatory bowel disease. UC typically presents with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding, and the sigmoidoscopy findings of a granular, hyperemic, and friable rectal mucosa are characteristic. Patients with long-standing UC are at increased risk for colorectal cancer due to chronic inflammation and dysplasia. The risk of colorectal cancer increases with the duration and extent of the disease. Other options like hemolytic uremic syndrome, oral ulcers, and gastric cancer are not typically associated with UC. Therefore, the patient is at greatest risk of developing colorectal cancer.",9
4090,"Mifepristone is a medication used in medical management of miscarriage and abortion. It is a progesterone receptor antagonist. Progesterone is crucial for maintaining pregnancy as it stabilizes the uterine lining and prevents contractions. By blocking progesterone receptors, mifepristone increases myometrial sensitivity to contractions and induces decidual breakdown, facilitating the expulsion of the pregnancy tissue. This mechanism is why mifepristone is used in combination with misoprostol, which further stimulates uterine contractions to complete the process.",9
4091,"The patient is a 57-year-old man with a significant history of alcohol and tobacco use, both of which are risk factors for various cancers, including lung cancer. However, he has been in recovery for 7 years. He had a low-dose chest CT scan last year, which is typically used for lung cancer screening in high-risk individuals, such as those with a significant smoking history. The guidelines for lung cancer screening recommend annual low-dose CT scans for individuals aged 55-80 years with a 30 pack-year smoking history who currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Since he had a CT scan last year and is still within the 15-year window since quitting smoking, a repeat low-dose CT scan is indicated. Therefore, the most appropriate action is to perform another chest CT scan.",9
4080,"The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest Cushing's disease, which is a form of Cushing's syndrome caused by a pituitary adenoma secreting ACTH. The key findings include obesity with central fat distribution, hypertension, and hyperglycemia. The 24-hour urinary cortisol is elevated, and the serum cortisol is high. The low-dose dexamethasone suppression test is not responsive, indicating Cushing's syndrome. However, the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test is responsive, which is consistent with a pituitary source of ACTH (Cushing's disease). The ACTH level is slightly elevated, supporting this diagnosis. Imaging did not show a pituitary adenoma, which can occur if the adenoma is very small. The next step to confirm the pituitary source of ACTH is inferior petrosal sinus sampling, which can help differentiate between a pituitary and ectopic source of ACTH production.",9
4094,"The patient's symptoms of postprandial abdominal pain and significant weight loss suggest a condition related to mesenteric ischemia. The pain occurring after eating is characteristic of intestinal angina, which is often due to reduced blood flow to the intestines. Given her history of smoking and hypertension, she is at risk for atherosclerosis, which can lead to narrowing of the mesenteric arteries. The normal CA 19-9 and CEA levels make a pancreatic malignancy less likely. An embolus in the superior mesenteric artery would typically cause more acute and severe symptoms. Decreased gastric motility would not typically cause significant weight loss and postprandial pain. Therefore, narrowing of the celiac artery, leading to chronic mesenteric ischemia, is the most likely cause of her symptoms.",9
4103,"The patient is immunocompromised with a CD4+ count of 98/mm3, indicating advanced HIV. She presents with fever, skin lesions, and oral thrush, suggesting opportunistic infections. The skin biopsy shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain, which is characteristic of bacillary angiomatosis caused by Bartonella species. Bacillary angiomatosis is common in HIV patients with low CD4 counts. The treatment for bacillary angiomatosis is typically with macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin or doxycycline. Among the options provided, erythromycin is the appropriate choice for treating bacillary angiomatosis.",9
4100,"The patient presents with difficulty breathing, peripheral edema, and crackles in the lungs, which are indicative of fluid overload. His history of hypertension and diabetes, along with the recent cessation of medications, suggests a cardiovascular issue. The presence of crackles and edema, along with tender hepatomegaly, points towards heart failure with hepatic congestion. The elevated blood pressure and tachycardia further support this. Diabetic ketoacidosis is unlikely due to the absence of hyperglycemic symptoms and acidosis signs. Pulmonary embolism typically presents with sudden onset dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain, not with peripheral edema. Acute renal failure could cause edema but would not explain the pulmonary findings as well as heart failure does. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is acute decompensated heart failure.",9
4104,"The patient is presenting with signs of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), likely due to an infection given the fever and increased sputum production. The ABG analysis shows respiratory acidosis with hypoxemia (low PO2) and hypercapnia (high PCO2), indicating respiratory failure. The most immediate concern is the low oxygen saturation (87%), which needs to be addressed to prevent further hypoxic damage. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to provide oxygen supplementation to improve the patient's oxygenation. While bronchodilators like albuterol and antibiotics like levofloxacin may be necessary parts of the overall treatment plan, the immediate priority is correcting the hypoxemia.",9
4106,"To calculate the filtration fraction (FF), we need to determine the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the renal plasma flow (RPF). The formula for FF is FF = GFR / RPF.

1. **Calculate GFR using creatinine clearance:**
   - Creatinine clearance (GFR) = (Urine creatinine concentration x Urine flow rate) / Plasma creatinine concentration.
   - GFR = (1.25 mg/mL x 1 mL/min) / 0.0125 mg/mL = 100 mL/min.

2. **Calculate RPF from renal blood flow (RBF):**
   - RPF = RBF x (1 - Hematocrit).
   - RPF = 1000 mL/min x (1 - 0.40) = 600 mL/min.

3. **Calculate Filtration Fraction (FF):**
   - FF = GFR / RPF = 100 mL/min / 600 mL/min = 0.1667 or approximately 17%.

Therefore, the best approximation for the filtration fraction is 17%.",10
4114,"The patient presents with hypertension, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and a right adrenal mass. These findings are suggestive of primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome), which is characterized by excessive production of aldosterone by the adrenal gland. Aldosterone causes sodium retention, potassium excretion, and hydrogen ion excretion, leading to hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. In primary hyperaldosteronism, the excessive aldosterone production suppresses renin release, resulting in low plasma renin levels. Therefore, the finding associated with the patient's most likely diagnosis is low plasma renin.",10
4115,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of temporal arteritis (giant cell arteritis), characterized by headache, jaw claudication, and visual symptoms. The tenderness over the temporal region and the patient's age further support this diagnosis. Temporal arteritis can lead to vision loss if not treated promptly. The best initial step in management is to start high-dose corticosteroids immediately to prevent complications such as blindness. Therefore, the correct management step is to administer methylprednisolone.",9
4111,"The patient presents with dyspnea, hemoptysis, and renal involvement (hematuria and proteinuria), which suggests a pulmonary-renal syndrome. The combination of pulmonary symptoms (hemoptysis and infiltrates) and renal findings (hematuria and proteinuria) is characteristic of Goodpasture's syndrome, which is associated with anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies. The presence of inspiratory crackles and pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray further supports this diagnosis. Other conditions that could present similarly include granulomatosis with polyangiitis (c-ANCA) and microscopic polyangiitis (p-ANCA), but the classic presentation of Goodpasture's syndrome aligns with the symptoms described. Therefore, the most likely finding in further evaluation would be increased anti-GBM antibody titers.",9
4123,"The pudendal nerve originates from the sacral plexus, specifically from the nerve roots S2, S3, and S4. It is responsible for innervating the perineum and is commonly blocked during childbirth to provide pain relief. The ischial spine is a landmark for administering a pudendal nerve block. Therefore, the correct nerve roots for the pudendal nerve are S2-S4.",9
4122,"The patient is a 52-year-old woman who has symptoms consistent with genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), previously known as atrophic vaginitis. Her symptoms include vaginal itchiness, urinary frequency, painful intercourse, and vaginal spotting. She is postmenopausal, as indicated by her last menstrual cycle being 14 months ago. The pelvic examination findings of scarce pubic hair, vulvar pallor, and narrowing of the vaginal introitus are also consistent with GSM. These symptoms are primarily due to estrogen deficiency, which leads to thinning of the vaginal and vulvar epithelium, decreased elasticity, and reduced lubrication. This thinning of the mucosa is the most likely contributor to her symptoms.",9
4137,"The patient presents with symptoms and findings suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Key points include his excessive daytime sleepiness, frequent awakenings at night, obesity (BMI of 37 kg/m2), and oropharyngeal examination findings of a small orifice, enlarged tongue, uvula, and low-lying soft palate. These are classic features of OSA, which can lead to pulmonary hypertension due to intermittent hypoxia and increased sympathetic activity. The echocardiography findings of a mildly dilated right ventricle and elevated systolic pulmonary artery pressure, along with the absence of left heart abnormalities, support the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension secondary to OSA. The ventilation-perfusion scan rules out pulmonary thromboembolism. The patient's smoking history and lack of cough make COPD less likely, and idiopathic pulmonary artery hypertension is less likely given the clear association with OSA symptoms.",9
4130,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest X-linked agammaglobulinemia (Bruton's agammaglobulinemia), characterized by recurrent bacterial infections, absent B cells, and normal T cells. This condition results from a defect in B cell maturation, leading to low or absent immunoglobulins. The management of this condition involves replacing the missing immunoglobulins to prevent infections. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is the administration of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG).",9
4139,"The patient is a 15-year-old African-American boy with groin pain and difficulty walking, along with a history of joint and bone pain requiring hospitalization. The pain is exacerbated by activity and there is tenderness over the lateral aspect of the hip with pain on passive internal rotation. These symptoms, along with the patient's demographic and medical history, suggest a condition related to blood supply to the bone. Avascular necrosis is a condition where there is loss of blood supply to the bone, leading to bone death and joint pain. This is particularly common in patients with a history of sickle cell disease, which is suggested by the patient's history of joint and bone pain requiring hospitalization. The absence of trauma and the specific pain pattern further support avascular necrosis over other conditions like slipped capital femoral epiphysis or stress fracture.",9
4149,"The patient's symptoms of numbness, tingling, weakness, decreased sensation, ataxia, and a positive Romberg sign suggest a neurological issue, likely related to a deficiency. Given her history of Crohn's disease and ileocolectomy, she may have malabsorption issues. Vitamin B12 deficiency is known to cause subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, leading to the neurological symptoms described, including ataxia and a positive Romberg sign. This is consistent with the patient's presentation.",9
4146,"The patient's symptoms include rapidly progressive memory loss, disorientation, and myoclonus (jerky, repetitive, twitching movements). These symptoms are characteristic of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a prion disease. CJD is caused by the accumulation of abnormal prion proteins in the brain, leading to neurodegeneration. The rapid progression of symptoms over weeks, along with myoclonus, strongly suggests a prion disease rather than other neurodegenerative conditions or metabolic disorders. Wilson's disease (copper accumulation) and Huntington's disease (increased CAG repeats) have different clinical presentations and progression timelines. Severe cerebral ischemia would present differently, often with focal neurological deficits rather than diffuse cognitive decline and myoclonus.",9
4138,"The patient presents with initial hematuria, where the urine is reddish-brown at the start of micturition and clears by the end. This pattern suggests that the bleeding is occurring at the beginning of the urinary tract, likely distal to the bladder. The absence of dysuria and the presence of normal physical examination findings, along with the laboratory results showing blood in the urine without proteinuria or RBC casts, suggest a non-glomerular source of bleeding. The presence of RBCs without casts and the pattern of hematuria indicate a lower urinary tract source. Initial hematuria is typically associated with bleeding from the urethra. Therefore, the most likely origin of this patient's hematuria is the urethra.",9
4150,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of reactive arthritis, which is characterized by the triad of urethritis, conjunctivitis, and arthritis. This condition is often associated with HLA-B27 positivity. The patient's symptoms include urethral discharge, joint pain, and eye symptoms, aligning with reactive arthritis. The association with livestock and the absence of systemic symptoms like fever make other autoimmune conditions less likely. Therefore, HLA-B27 is the most likely to be positive in this patient.",9
4157,"The patient is a 61-year-old man with a significant smoking history (half a pack per day since age 20) and symptoms suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). His medical history includes hypertension and osteoarthritis, and he is on lisinopril and aspirin. The question asks for a recommendation for this patient at this time.

Option A, low-dose chest CT, is recommended for lung cancer screening in adults aged 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. This patient has a 20.5 pack-year history (0.5 packs/day x 41 years), which does not meet the 30 pack-year threshold.

Option B, intra-articular steroid injection, is not indicated based on the information provided, as there is no mention of acute joint pain or inflammation requiring such treatment.

Option C, zoster vaccine, is recommended for adults aged 50 years and older to prevent shingles. This patient is 61 years old and should receive the zoster vaccine if he hasn't already.

Option D, meningococcal vaccine, is typically recommended for specific populations such as adolescents, people with certain medical conditions, or those traveling to areas where meningococcal disease is common. There is no indication that this patient falls into one of these categories.

Given the patient's age and the general recommendation for the zoster vaccine, option C is the most appropriate choice.",9
4159,"The patient presents with recurrent episodes of jaundice with elevated total bilirubin and normal direct bilirubin, indicating unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The normal liver function tests (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase) and normal hematocrit, LDH, and haptoglobin suggest that there is no hemolysis or liver dysfunction. The episodes are self-limited and have been occurring for many years without other symptoms such as dark urine or pruritus, which are more typical of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Gilbert’s syndrome is a common cause of mild, recurrent unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to reduced activity of the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. This fits the clinical picture presented. Dubin-Johnson syndrome would cause conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, and cholelithiasis would typically present with abdominal pain and possibly conjugated hyperbilirubinemia if there is bile duct obstruction. Medication-induced hemolysis would show signs of hemolysis in lab tests, which are not present here.",9
4164,"The patient presents with symptoms and findings suggestive of dilated cardiomyopathy, as evidenced by the dilated left ventricle and reduced ejection fraction. The ECG shows atrial fibrillation, which can be associated with dilated cardiomyopathy. The chest x-ray findings of globular heart enlargement and bilateral infiltrates suggest heart failure. Among the options, chronic supraventricular tachycardia (option B) can lead to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, which is a reversible form of dilated cardiomyopathy caused by prolonged periods of rapid heart rate. This aligns with the irregularly irregular rhythm seen on ECG, indicative of atrial fibrillation, which can cause a persistently elevated heart rate if not controlled. Other options like hypertension, genetic mutations, or acute stress are less consistent with the presentation and findings.",9
4169,"The patient is a 44-year-old woman with dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia, along with a tender, soft, and enlarged uterus. The uterus is enlarged to the size of a 10-week pregnant uterus, which suggests a diffuse process rather than a focal one. The negative pregnancy test rules out pregnancy. The symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with adenomyosis, which is characterized by the presence of endometrial glands and stroma within the uterine myometrium. This condition often presents with a tender, enlarged uterus and heavy menstrual bleeding. The other options are less likely: 

- A (Hyperplastic overgrowths of endometrial glands and stroma) refers to endometrial polyps, which typically do not cause uterine enlargement to this extent.
- B (Malignant invasion of endometrial cells into uterine myometrium) refers to endometrial cancer, which is less likely given the patient's age and presentation.
- D (Presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterus) refers to endometriosis, which typically presents with dyspareunia and pelvic pain, not an enlarged uterus.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is adenomyosis.",9
4171,"The patient's symptoms of recurrent right upper abdominal pain, especially after fatty meals, radiating to the right shoulder and back, along with nausea and vomiting, are classic for biliary colic due to gallstones. The lab findings show mildly elevated liver enzymes, which can occur with gallstones causing intermittent obstruction of the cystic duct or common bile duct. The normal white blood cell count and ESR suggest there is no acute infection or inflammation, which would be more indicative of acute cholecystitis or cholangitis. The absence of jaundice and normal alkaline phosphatase make choledocholithiasis less likely. Pancreatitis would typically present with more severe pain and elevated pancreatic enzymes, which are not provided here. A duodenal ulcer would not typically cause pain radiating to the shoulder and back. Gallbladder cancer is unlikely given the lack of significant systemic symptoms or a palpable mass. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is gallstones causing biliary colic.",9
4168,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a pituitary adenoma, given the intrasellar mass on MRI and the visual field defects (impaired peripheral vision), which are indicative of bitemporal hemianopsia due to compression of the optic chiasm. The most common type of pituitary adenoma is a prolactinoma, which can cause symptoms such as galactorrhea and impotence. However, the question asks for the most likely finding. In men, prolactinomas often present with impotence due to decreased testosterone levels secondary to hyperprolactinemia. Galactorrhea is less common in men. Therefore, the most likely finding in this scenario is impotence.",9
4176,"The patient presents with hypercalcemia, as indicated by a calcium level of 14.5 mg/dL. The parathyroid hormone (PTH) level is low at 18 pg/mL, which suggests that the hypercalcemia is not due to primary hyperparathyroidism, as this would typically present with elevated PTH levels. The PTHrP level is elevated at 4 pmol/L, which is above the normal value of < 2 pmol/L. Elevated PTHrP is commonly associated with malignancy, particularly certain cancers like squamous cell carcinomas, which can produce PTHrP and lead to hypercalcemia. The calcitriol level is within the normal range, which makes hypervitaminosis D unlikely. Chronic kidney disease would typically present with low calcium levels due to decreased calcitriol production and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Therefore, the elevated PTHrP in the context of hypercalcemia and low PTH suggests that the most likely cause of this patient's hypercalcemia is malignancy.",9
4175,"The patient's symptoms include weakness, absent reflexes, muscle weakness, fasciculations, and a dissociated sensory loss (loss of pain and temperature sensation with preserved vibration and proprioception). This pattern is characteristic of syringomyelia, where a cyst or syrinx forms within the spinal cord, often affecting the crossing fibers of the spinothalamic tract (responsible for pain and temperature sensation) while sparing the dorsal columns (responsible for vibration and proprioception). The history of a motor vehicle collision could suggest trauma leading to syrinx formation. The absence of pupillary abnormalities rules out conditions like Horner's syndrome, which can sometimes be associated with syringomyelia but is not necessary for the diagnosis. Other options like tabes dorsalis, ALS, and cervical disk prolapse do not fit the sensory dissociation pattern seen here.",9
4180,"The stages of change model, also known as the Transtheoretical Model, describes the process individuals go through when changing behavior. The stages are:

1. **Precontemplation**: The individual is not considering change and may not see their behavior as a problem.
2. **Contemplation**: The individual recognizes the problem and is considering change but has not yet committed to taking action.
3. **Preparation**: The individual intends to take action soon and may begin taking small steps toward change.
4. **Action**: The individual actively takes steps to change their behavior.
5. **Maintenance**: The individual works to sustain the change and prevent relapse.

In this scenario, the patient acknowledges that his alcohol consumption is negatively affecting his relationships, indicating awareness of the problem. However, he has not yet attempted to reduce his drinking and expresses doubt about his ability to stop. This aligns with the **Contemplation** stage, where the individual is aware of the problem and considering change but has not yet taken action.",9
4177,"The patient has a cavitary lung lesion and symptoms consistent with tuberculosis (TB), and the pathogen is resistant to multiple drugs, including streptomycin. Streptomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that works by binding to the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, inhibiting protein synthesis. Resistance to streptomycin typically occurs through mutations that alter the 30S ribosomal subunit, preventing the drug from binding effectively. Therefore, the mechanism of resistance to streptomycin in this case is most likely due to an alteration in the 30S ribosomal subunit.",9
4178,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a cervical radiculopathy. The pain radiates to the radial aspect of the forearm, thumb, and index finger, which corresponds to the C6 dermatome. The weakness in wrist extension and diminished brachioradialis reflex on the left side also point to C6 nerve root involvement. The Spurling maneuver, where extending and rotating the head to the affected side reproduces symptoms, is indicative of cervical radiculopathy. Carpal tunnel syndrome would affect the median nerve distribution, primarily the thumb, index, and middle fingers, but not typically involve the forearm or cause neck pain. Syringomyelia would present with a cape-like distribution of sensory loss and is not consistent with these findings. Thoracic outlet syndrome would affect the lower trunk of the brachial plexus, typically causing symptoms in the ulnar distribution. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is C5-C6 disc herniation causing C6 radiculopathy.",9
4185,"Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is an enzyme found in neutrophils that catalyzes the production of hypochlorous acid, a potent antimicrobial agent. This enzyme is responsible for the green color of pus and sputum due to its heme content. In the context of pneumonia, the green color of sputum is often due to the presence of MPO from neutrophils that have migrated to the site of infection to combat pathogens. Therefore, the clinical significance of MPO activity in pneumonia is the green color of the sputum, which is indicative of neutrophil activity and infection.",9
4187,"The venous blood gas shows a pH of 7.2, indicating acidemia. The PaCO2 is 80 mmHg, which is significantly elevated, suggesting a respiratory acidosis. The HCO3- is 24 mEq/L, which is within the normal range, indicating that there is no significant metabolic compensation. 

A. Aspirin overdose typically causes a mixed respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis, not a pure respiratory acidosis.

B. Diabetic ketoacidosis would present with a metabolic acidosis (low HCO3-) and not a primary respiratory acidosis.

C. Ethylene glycol intoxication causes a metabolic acidosis with an increased anion gap, not a primary respiratory acidosis.

D. Heroin overdose can cause respiratory depression leading to hypoventilation and respiratory acidosis due to CO2 retention, which matches the findings of elevated PaCO2 and acidemia.

Therefore, the most likely etiology of this patient's presentation is heroin overdose, which causes respiratory depression and subsequent respiratory acidosis.",10
4196,"The patient's presentation and genetic findings are suggestive of papillary thyroid carcinoma. The RET/PTC rearrangement is commonly associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma. Histologically, papillary thyroid carcinoma is characterized by the presence of calcified spherules known as psammoma bodies and large oval cells with nuclei that have a clear or empty appearance, often described as ""Orphan Annie eye"" nuclei. These features are consistent with option B.",9
4181,"The patient has symptoms consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and the endoscopy findings suggest a hiatal hernia with esophagitis and an esophageal ulcer. Initial treatment with omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), has not improved his symptoms. The presence of a hiatal hernia and persistent symptoms despite PPI therapy suggests that surgical intervention may be necessary. Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication with hiatoplasty is a surgical procedure that addresses both the hiatal hernia and reinforces the lower esophageal sphincter to prevent reflux. This is the most appropriate next step given the failure of medical management and the anatomical findings.",9
4198,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with an acute gout attack, characterized by sudden onset of severe pain, redness, and swelling in the first metatarsophalangeal joint. The presence of sodium urate crystals in the joint confirms the diagnosis of gout. During an acute gout attack, the primary goal is to relieve pain and inflammation. NSAIDs, colchicine, and corticosteroids are commonly used for this purpose. The patient has already tried acetaminophen and ibuprofen without relief, but naproxen, another NSAID, is a more potent option and is often used in acute gout attacks. Probenecid and allopurinol are used for long-term management to lower uric acid levels and prevent future attacks, not for acute management. Morphine is an opioid analgesic and is not typically used for gout pain. Therefore, the next best therapeutic step is to administer naproxen to manage the acute symptoms.",9
4201,"The patient's symptoms suggest a nasal polyp, which can be associated with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), also known as Samter's triad. This condition involves asthma, nasal polyps, and aspirin sensitivity. The key here is the mention of pain that migrates and is refractory to treatment, suggesting she might be taking NSAIDs like aspirin for pain relief. Aspirin and other NSAIDs inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway, leading to decreased prostaglandin production. This inhibition can cause a shunting of arachidonic acid metabolism towards the lipoxygenase pathway, increasing leukotriene production, which can lead to nasal polyps and respiratory symptoms. Therefore, the increased activity of the lipoxygenase pathway due to NSAID use is likely responsible for her nasal symptoms.",9
4190,"The patient has experienced a period of depression with symptoms such as anhedonia, social withdrawal, tearfulness, and weight loss. These depressive symptoms lasted for about 3 months. Following this, he developed bizarre delusions about aliens, which have persisted for 2 weeks, without the presence of depressive symptoms. This suggests that the psychotic symptoms are occurring independently of the mood symptoms. In schizoaffective disorder, mood symptoms and psychotic symptoms occur together, but there must also be a period of psychosis without mood symptoms. In this case, the psychotic symptoms (delusions) are present without concurrent mood symptoms, which fits the criteria for schizoaffective disorder. Schizophrenia with depression would require the psychotic symptoms to be present for at least 6 months, which is not the case here. Depression with psychotic features would require the psychotic symptoms to occur only during depressive episodes. Cannabis intoxication is unlikely to cause such prolonged delusions.",9
4200,"The symptoms and signs presented in this case are suggestive of phenylketonuria (PKU), a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme is responsible for converting phenylalanine to tyrosine. The accumulation of phenylalanine leads to neurological symptoms such as seizures and developmental delay, as well as a characteristic musty body odor due to the accumulation of phenylacetate. The light skin tone is due to decreased melanin production, as tyrosine is a precursor for melanin. In PKU, tyrosine becomes an essential amino acid because it cannot be synthesized from phenylalanine. Therefore, the patient should be supplemented with tyrosine in their diet.",9
4205,"The patient has a history and presentation consistent with gout, characterized by episodes of severe joint pain, particularly in the ankle and knee, associated with dietary triggers. The arthrocentesis findings of needle-shaped negatively birefringent crystals confirm the diagnosis of gout, which is caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals due to hyperuricemia. The patient's use of hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic, can contribute to increased uric acid levels, exacerbating gout attacks. While NSAIDs, colchicine, and steroids are used for acute management of gout flares, the question asks for the most appropriate long-term treatment. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors, such as allopurinol, are used to lower uric acid levels and prevent future gout attacks, making them the most appropriate choice for long-term management.",9
4210,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, including numbness, burning sensation, and decreased sensation in the feet. Her diabetes is not well-controlled, as indicated by an elevated hemoglobin A1C of 8.2%. The normal reflexes in the upper extremities and decreased ankle reflexes are typical for peripheral neuropathy. The normal MCV and lack of other neurological signs make vitamin B12 deficiency less likely. The symptoms are neuropathic in nature, suggesting the need for symptomatic treatment. Venlafaxine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is effective for neuropathic pain. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to manage her neuropathic pain with venlafaxine therapy.",9
4212,"The patient presents with a rash, fever, headaches, and muscle aches after a recent camping trip in Maine, which is a region endemic for Lyme disease. The rash is likely erythema migrans, a characteristic rash of Lyme disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, transmitted by Ixodes ticks. In pregnant women, the treatment of choice for early Lyme disease is oral amoxicillin, as doxycycline is contraindicated in pregnancy. Ceftriaxone is used for more severe manifestations such as neurological involvement, and penicillin G is not typically used for Lyme disease. Clotrimazole is an antifungal and not relevant here.",9
4214,"The infant's symptoms of severe sunburns and freckling in sun-exposed areas suggest a condition related to DNA repair defects, specifically those that handle UV-induced DNA damage. Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a condition characterized by extreme sensitivity to UV light due to defects in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. NER is responsible for repairing bulky DNA adducts, such as those caused by UV-induced thymine dimers. The consanguineous marriage increases the likelihood of autosomal recessive conditions like XP. Base excision repair (B) is involved in fixing small, non-helix-distorting base lesions. Mismatch repair (C) corrects base mismatches that occur during DNA replication. Non-homologous end joining (D) repairs double-strand breaks. Given the symptoms and the likely condition, the defective mechanism is nucleotide excision repair.",9
4207,"The patient has cystic fibrosis, which is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. We need to identify another condition with a similar autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.

A. Accumulation of glycogen in the lysosome is seen in Pompe disease, which is autosomal recessive.
B. Inability to convert carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine into citrulline is seen in ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, which is X-linked recessive.
C. Abnormal production of type IV collagen is seen in Alport syndrome, which is usually X-linked dominant.
D. Mutated gene for mitochondrial-tRNA-Lys is associated with mitochondrial inheritance, not autosomal recessive.

Therefore, the condition with a similar mode of inheritance as cystic fibrosis is Pompe disease.",9
4217,"The patient presents with fever, tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, irritability, mydriasis, hyperreflexia, and clonus. These symptoms are consistent with serotonin syndrome, which can occur when there is an excess of serotonin in the central nervous system. The patient is taking fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and has recently taken St. John’s wort, which can increase serotonin levels by inhibiting its reuptake. The combination of these two can lead to serotonin syndrome. The other options are less likely: diabetic ketoacidosis would present with metabolic acidosis and dehydration, anaphylactic reaction would involve hypotension and respiratory symptoms, and sepsis would typically present with hypotension and signs of infection.",9
4218,"The patient is a 61-year-old woman who is up to date on her health screenings. She had a normal colonoscopy 6 years ago, which is typically recommended every 10 years for average-risk individuals starting at age 50. Her father developed colon cancer at age 75, which does not significantly alter her screening schedule. Therefore, she does not need another colonoscopy at this time. 

Serum HIV testing is not routinely recommended for someone in her demographic unless there are risk factors, which she does not have. 

A fecal occult blood test is an alternative to colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening, but since she had a colonoscopy 6 years ago, this is not necessary.

Given that all her screenings are up to date and she has no new risk factors or symptoms, reassurance is the most appropriate recommendation.",9
4221,"Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a cytokine produced by antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, in response to intracellular pathogens like bacteria and viruses. IL-12 plays a crucial role in the differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into Th1 cells. Th1 cells are primarily involved in cell-mediated immunity, which is effective against intracellular pathogens. They produce cytokines like interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) that activate macrophages and enhance the killing of intracellular pathogens. Therefore, when a CD4+ T cell is exposed to IL-12, it will promote a cell-mediated immune response.",9
4219,"The patient is experiencing severe pain with vaginal penetration, which is consistent with vaginismus. Vaginismus is characterized by involuntary contraction of the pelvic floor muscles, leading to pain during intercourse, tampon insertion, or pelvic examination. The negative tests for infections and the inability to perform a bimanual exam due to pain further support this diagnosis. The best initial management for vaginismus is pelvic floor physical therapy, which focuses on exercises and techniques to relax the pelvic floor muscles and gradually allow for comfortable penetration.",9
4224,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of acute mastoiditis, a complication of acute otitis media. The key findings include fever, irritability, postauricular erythema and tenderness, and displacement of the auricle. The leukocytosis with neutrophilia supports a bacterial infection. In cases of suspected mastoiditis, imaging is often necessary to assess the extent of the infection and any potential complications, such as abscess formation. A CT scan of the temporal bone is the appropriate imaging study to evaluate the mastoid air cells and surrounding structures. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to obtain a CT scan of the temporal bone to confirm the diagnosis and guide further treatment.",9
4231,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of mixed cryoglobulinemia, a condition often associated with chronic hepatitis C infection. The key features include fatigue, arthralgia, palpable purpura (non-blanching purple papules), and elevated liver enzymes. Mixed cryoglobulinemia is characterized by the presence of cryoglobulins in the blood, which can lead to vasculitis and the symptoms described. A common laboratory finding in mixed cryoglobulinemia is hypocomplementemia, particularly low levels of complement components C4 and C3, due to complement consumption by immune complexes.",9
4226,"Flutamide is a non-steroidal anti-androgen that works by blocking androgen receptors, thereby inhibiting the action of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone on prostate cancer cells. However, flutamide alone is not sufficient for optimal treatment of advanced prostate cancer. The addition of a GnRH agonist like leuprolide is beneficial because it reduces the production of testosterone by the testes through downregulation of the pituitary-gonadal axis. This combination, known as combined androgen blockade, is more effective in reducing androgen levels and controlling prostate cancer progression than flutamide alone. Anastrozole is an aromatase inhibitor used in breast cancer, clomiphene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator used in infertility, and cyproterone is another anti-androgen but not typically used in combination with flutamide for prostate cancer.",9
4230,"The patient presents with nephrotic syndrome, indicated by significant proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. The presence of hepatitis B surface antigen suggests a possible association with membranous nephropathy, which is known to be linked with hepatitis B infection. Membranous nephropathy is characterized by subepithelial deposits on renal biopsy. The decreased complement C4 level also supports this diagnosis, as complement activation can occur in membranous nephropathy. Other options, such as eosinophilic nodules (associated with diabetic nephropathy) and normal-appearing glomeruli (associated with minimal change disease), are less likely given the context of hepatitis B infection. Increased IgA levels would suggest IgA nephropathy, which typically presents with hematuria, not nephrotic syndrome.",9
4239,"The patient's symptoms and travel history are key to identifying the diagnosis. She has a history of high fever, retro-orbital pain, myalgias, and a maculopapular rash, which are characteristic of dengue fever. The progression to severe abdominal pain, bleeding gums, hematemesis, and shock suggests dengue hemorrhagic fever, a severe form of dengue. The low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and leukopenia further support this diagnosis. Her recent travel to Brazil, where dengue is endemic, aligns with this diagnosis. Chikungunya typically presents with severe joint pain but not with hemorrhagic symptoms. Chagas disease is a chronic condition with different symptoms, and yellow fever would typically present with jaundice and higher liver enzyme levels. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is dengue fever.",9
4240,"The clinical presentation and imaging findings suggest a medulloblastoma, a common pediatric brain tumor located in the cerebellum. The symptoms of morning headaches, nausea, dizziness, and ataxia are consistent with increased intracranial pressure and cerebellar dysfunction. The biopsy reveals cells of primitive neuroectodermal origin, which is characteristic of medulloblastoma. Histologically, medulloblastomas are known for having small, round blue cells that can form Homer-Wright rosettes. This matches option C.",9
4243,"The patient presents with a non-healing erythematous, scaly, ulcerated plaque on the arm, which is concerning for a skin malignancy. His occupational exposure at an industrial ammunition factory suggests potential exposure to carcinogens, which increases the risk for skin cancer. The lesion's description and the patient's history of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea could suggest systemic exposure to toxins, but the key focus is the skin lesion. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) often presents as a non-healing ulcerated plaque, especially in areas exposed to carcinogens or chronic irritation. Actinic keratosis is a precursor to SCC but typically presents as rough, scaly patches rather than ulcerated plaques. Erysipelas is an acute bacterial skin infection, usually presenting with well-demarcated, raised, red areas, often with systemic symptoms like fever, which are not described here. Contact dermatitis would present with itching and is usually related to a specific exposure, resolving with avoidance. Given the occupational exposure and lesion characteristics, SCC is the most likely diagnosis.",9
4247,"The patient's symptoms of dry mouth, blurred vision, dry mucous membranes, and dilated pupils suggest anticholinergic effects. These symptoms are consistent with the use of an anticholinergic drug. Oxybutynin is an anticholinergic medication used to treat overactive bladder and can cause similar anticholinergic side effects such as dry mouth and blurred vision. Oxycodone is an opioid and does not typically cause these anticholinergic effects. Phenylephrine is an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist and primarily causes vasoconstriction, not anticholinergic effects. Loratadine is an antihistamine that is less likely to cause anticholinergic side effects compared to first-generation antihistamines.",9
4238,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of hemolytic anemia: fatigue, jaundice, dark urine, low hemoglobin, high reticulocyte count, elevated bilirubin, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. The presence of spherocytes on the peripheral blood smear indicates red blood cell membrane abnormalities. The positive direct Coombs' test suggests that the hemolysis is immune-mediated, as the test detects antibodies or complement on the surface of red blood cells. This finding is consistent with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own red blood cells. Hereditary spherocytosis would also show spherocytes but typically has a negative Coombs' test. Alpha thalassemia and spur cell hemolytic anemia do not fit the clinical and laboratory picture as well as AIHA does.",9
4249,"The patient's presentation is consistent with opioid intoxication, given the low respiratory rate (5/min), bradycardia (pulse of 50/min), and minimal responsiveness. Opioid intoxication typically causes miosis (constricted pupils), respiratory depression, and altered mental status. The history of alcohol abuse does not directly relate to the current symptoms, but substance abuse history can often include opioids. The other options are less consistent with opioid intoxication: conjunctival hyperemia is more associated with cannabis use, hyperactive bowel sounds with stimulant use, and mydriasis with stimulant or anticholinergic intoxication.",9
4250,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with acute bacterial sinusitis, including facial pain, congestion, and purulent nasal discharge. The progression from clear to purulent discharge suggests a bacterial infection following an initial viral infection. Viral upper respiratory tract infections are common predisposing factors for bacterial sinusitis because they can cause mucosal inflammation and obstruction of sinus drainage, leading to secondary bacterial infection. The patient's asthma and use of antihistamines are less directly related to the development of bacterial sinusitis. Nasal polyps could contribute to sinusitis, but there is no mention of polyps in the examination findings. Therefore, the most likely predisposing factor is a recent viral upper respiratory tract infection.",9
4252,"The patient's symptoms and lab results are indicative of hypothyroidism. She has dry skin, constipation, cold intolerance, weight gain, and bradycardia, all of which are classic signs of hypothyroidism. Her lab results show elevated TSH and low T4, confirming primary hypothyroidism. Among the medications listed, amiodarone is known to affect thyroid function. It can cause both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism due to its high iodine content and effects on thyroid hormone synthesis and metabolism. Given her history of cardiac arrhythmias, it is likely she is on amiodarone, which is known to cause hypothyroidism as a side effect.",9
4253,"The patient has a history of significant cardiovascular disease, including a previous myocardial infarction and angina, and presents with new chest pain. His coronary arteriography shows significant stenosis in two major coronary arteries (65% in the LAD and 75% in the LCX) and a reduced ejection fraction, indicating impaired cardiac function. 

In patients with multivessel coronary artery disease and reduced ejection fraction, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is often preferred over percutaneous interventions like angioplasty with stent placement. CABG is recommended because it can provide better long-term outcomes in terms of survival and symptom relief in patients with multivessel disease and impaired left ventricular function.

Heparin is used for acute management of unstable angina or myocardial infarction, but it is not a definitive treatment for stable coronary artery disease. Extended release nitrate therapy can help manage symptoms but does not address the underlying stenosis.

Therefore, the recommended treatment for this patient, considering his multivessel disease and reduced ejection fraction, is CABG.",9
4261,"The patient initially presented with symptoms suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome, likely a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) given the ST depressions. He underwent emergency revascularization. Seven days later, he developed dyspnea that worsens when lying down (orthopnea) and has bibasilar crackles, indicating pulmonary congestion or heart failure. The new holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border suggests mitral regurgitation. In the context of a recent myocardial infarction, this is most likely due to papillary muscle rupture, which can occur within a week after an MI and leads to acute mitral valve insufficiency, causing pulmonary edema and a new murmur.",9
4256,"The patient presents with sinusitis, nasal drainage that is purulent and occasionally hemorrhagic, fatigue, joint pain, and renal involvement (hematuria and proteinuria). These symptoms suggest a systemic vasculitis. 

Churg-Strauss syndrome (A) typically involves asthma, eosinophilia, and systemic vasculitis, which are not mentioned here.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (B), formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis, is characterized by upper respiratory tract involvement (sinusitis, nasal discharge), lower respiratory tract involvement, and renal disease (glomerulonephritis), which matches the patient's symptoms.

Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (C) primarily presents with hematuria and renal involvement but lacks the systemic symptoms like sinusitis and joint pain.

Sarcoidosis (D) can cause systemic symptoms but typically presents with pulmonary involvement and does not usually cause the combination of sinusitis, renal involvement, and joint pain.

Therefore, the combination of sinusitis, nasal involvement, joint pain, and renal symptoms is most consistent with granulomatosis with polyangiitis.",9
4267,"The patient presents with a gradually enlarging neck mass in the midline, which is suggestive of a thyroid nodule. The histological sample from the fine-needle aspiration is crucial for diagnosis. Papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer and is characterized histologically by the presence of papillary structures, nuclear grooves, and Orphan Annie eye nuclei. Medullary thyroid carcinoma is associated with calcitonin production and amyloid stroma, while follicular thyroid carcinoma shows follicular patterns and vascular invasion. B-cell lymphoma of the thyroid is rare and usually associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Given the commonality and typical presentation, papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most likely diagnosis.",9
4264,"The patient presents with symptoms and imaging findings consistent with an aortic dissection, specifically a Stanford type B dissection, as the intimal flap is limited to the descending aorta. In type B dissections, the primary management is medical rather than surgical unless there are complications such as organ ischemia or rupture. The goal is to control blood pressure and heart rate to reduce shear stress on the aortic wall. Intravenous beta-blockers, such as esmolol, are preferred for rapid control of heart rate and blood pressure. Esmolol is a short-acting beta-blocker that can be titrated quickly to achieve the desired effect. Oral medications are not appropriate for acute management, and nitroglycerin is not the first-line treatment for aortic dissection. Therefore, the best next step is to start intravenous esmolol.",9
4268,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest a defect in leukocyte adhesion. The key detail is the lack of Sialyl-Lewis X on the neutrophils. Sialyl-Lewis X is a carbohydrate moiety that is crucial for the rolling phase of leukocyte extravasation. During the rolling process, selectins on the endothelial cells bind to Sialyl-Lewis X on leukocytes, allowing them to roll along the vessel wall. A deficiency in Sialyl-Lewis X would impair this rolling process, leading to the inability of leukocytes to properly adhere and migrate to sites of infection, resulting in recurrent infections. This condition is consistent with Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency type 2 (LAD-2). Therefore, the deficient process in this patient is rolling.",9
4272,"The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are suggestive of a peripheral neuropathy. The combination of muscle weakness, atrophy, sensory loss, and absent ankle reflexes, along with the chronic progression, points towards a hereditary neuropathy. The most common hereditary neuropathy is Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which is a genetic disorder. This condition typically presents with distal muscle weakness and atrophy, sensory loss, and areflexia, often starting in the lower extremities. The genetic nature of the disease aligns with the patient's presentation of progressive symptoms over a year, consistent with a hereditary neuropathy rather than an acute or subacute process seen in autoimmune, infectious, or metabolic causes.",9
4277,"The patient presents with symptoms of mania, including decreased need for sleep and grandiosity, as evidenced by his behavior at the intersection. He also reports auditory hallucinations. His previous hospitalization involved auditory hallucinations and paranoia without mood symptoms, which suggests a psychotic disorder. Schizoaffective disorder is characterized by symptoms of both mood disorder (mania or depression) and schizophrenia, with mood symptoms present for a significant portion of the illness. The current presentation includes both manic and psychotic symptoms, fitting the criteria for schizoaffective disorder. Schizophrenia would not typically include prominent mood symptoms like mania. Schizotypal disorder involves personality traits and does not typically present with acute psychotic episodes. Unipolar mania would not explain the previous psychotic episode without mood symptoms.",9
4283,"The patient's symptoms and the presence of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies suggest Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which is a common cause of hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is characterized by symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. In hypothyroidism, patients often have delayed deep tendon reflexes, constipation, and other symptoms related to decreased metabolic activity. Galactorrhea can occur due to increased levels of prolactin, which can be seen in hypothyroidism due to increased TRH stimulating prolactin release. The other options are more consistent with hyperthyroidism (brisk reflexes, diarrhea, proptosis).",9
4287,"The patient's occupational history and smoking history are key factors in this case. He has worked for a demolition company for 35 years, which suggests potential asbestos exposure. The presence of bilateral calcified pleural plaques on the chest X-ray is indicative of asbestos exposure. Asbestos exposure is strongly associated with the development of certain lung conditions, particularly mesothelioma and bronchogenic carcinoma. While mesothelioma is a well-known consequence of asbestos exposure, bronchogenic carcinoma is actually more common in individuals with asbestos exposure, especially when combined with a history of smoking. The patient's smoking history further increases the risk of bronchogenic carcinoma. Therefore, given the combination of asbestos exposure and smoking, the patient is most likely to develop bronchogenic carcinoma.",9
4257,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction (MI), including chest pain radiating to the jaw, diaphoresis, and risk factors like hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. After stabilization, the patient is at risk for complications related to the MI. Two days post-MI, one common complication is a pericarditis known as Dressler's syndrome, which is associated with a friction rub. Other complications such as ventricular septal rupture or papillary muscle rupture leading to an intra-cardiac shunt or mitral insufficiency, respectively, typically occur a few days to a week later, not just two days after the MI. Ventricular fibrillation is a risk during the acute phase, but the question specifies a complication seen two days later. Therefore, the most likely complication characterized by a friction rub is pericarditis occurring post-MI.",9
4274,"The boy presents with symptoms suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), such as snoring and easy fatigue. His physical exam shows conjunctival pallor, indicating anemia. Given his dietary intake and pallor, iron deficiency anemia is likely. Iron deficiency anemia is characterized by increased red cell distribution width (RDW) and total iron binding capacity (TIBC). Decreased IGF levels would be related to growth hormone issues, which doesn't fit this case. Decreased vitamin D level could be possible but is not directly related to his symptoms. Decreased oxygen saturation during sleep is possible with OSA but the question asks for a finding we would expect, and anemia is more directly indicated by the lab findings and symptoms.",9
4298,"The patient's symptoms of facial swelling, tongue and mucous membrane edema, and difficulty breathing are indicative of angioedema. The history of recurrent episodes of facial swelling during childhood suggests a hereditary component. The recent initiation of lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, is also relevant as ACE inhibitors can cause angioedema, but the childhood history points towards a hereditary cause. Hereditary angioedema is caused by a deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor, leading to unregulated activation of the complement and contact systems, resulting in increased bradykinin and subsequent angioedema. Therefore, the underlying abnormality in this patient is most likely a deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor.",9
4308,"The patient has chronic hepatitis C infection, as indicated by the positive HCV RNA and the presence of significant inflammation with bridging fibrosis on liver biopsy. Historically, the treatment for hepatitis C involved the use of interferon and ribavirin. However, the standard of care has evolved to include direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), which are not listed as options here. Given the options provided, the combination of interferon and ribavirin was the traditional treatment approach for chronic hepatitis C before the advent of DAAs. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment from the given options is the combination of interferon and ribavirin.",9
4312,"The presentation of fever, headache, and a rash that starts on the wrists and ankles and spreads to the palms and soles is characteristic of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), which is caused by Rickettsia rickettsii. This condition is often associated with a history of tick exposure, such as a recent camping trip. The rash and symptoms align with RMSF, which is confirmed by serological testing showing cross-reactivity with Proteus antigens (Weil-Felix test).",9
4320,"The patient's symptoms of increased urination, increased thirst, abdominal pain, and constipation suggest a possible electrolyte imbalance. The normal blood glucose level rules out diabetes as a cause of her symptoms. The recent intake of over-the-counter vitamins and supplements raises the suspicion of hypercalcemia, which can cause polyuria, polydipsia, abdominal pain, and constipation. Hypercalcemia is often associated with excessive intake of calcium or vitamin D supplements. Therefore, checking the calcium level is most likely to provide the diagnosis.",9
4330,"The patient is a young man with signs suggestive of anabolic steroid use: hypertension, muscular build, acne, gynecomastia, and small testicles. Anabolic steroids can suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to decreased GnRH, LH, and FSH levels due to negative feedback. This suppression results in decreased endogenous testosterone production and testicular atrophy, which explains the small testicles. The decreased GnRH is a direct consequence of the negative feedback from exogenous steroids.",9
4333,"The patient is experiencing exertional chest pain, likely due to angina pectoris, which is being relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. Nitroglycerin primarily works by being converted to nitric oxide, which causes vasodilation. The primary effect of nitroglycerin is venodilation, which leads to increased venous pooling. This reduces the amount of blood returning to the heart (preload), thereby decreasing the end-diastolic volume and pressure. By reducing the preload, the heart's workload is decreased, and myocardial oxygen demand is reduced, leading to relief of angina symptoms. Therefore, the improvement in chest pain is most directly related to a decrease in end-diastolic pressure.",9
4338,"The patient presents with a painless, enlarged left testicle that does not transilluminate, suggesting a solid mass rather than a cystic one. The elevated β-Human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) level is a key laboratory finding. Seminomas can sometimes produce β-hCG, but they do not produce α-fetoprotein (AFP), which is consistent with the normal AFP level in this patient. Choriocarcinoma is known for significantly elevated β-hCG levels, often much higher than seen here, and is typically more aggressive and rare as a pure form in the testis. Yolk sac tumors are more common in children and typically have elevated AFP levels. A spermatocele would transilluminate and is usually not associated with elevated tumor markers. Given the elevated β-hCG and normal AFP, the most likely diagnosis is a seminoma.",9
4332,"The patient has experienced multiple manic episodes, as indicated by the current episode and two similar episodes last year. This suggests a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, which typically requires long-term management to prevent future episodes. Lithium is a mood stabilizer commonly used for both acute management of mania and long-term maintenance to prevent recurrence of manic and depressive episodes in bipolar disorder. Given the recurrent nature of the patient's episodes, lifelong treatment with lithium is generally recommended to maintain mood stability and prevent future episodes. Therefore, the most appropriate management plan for this patient is to continue lithium lifelong.",9
4342,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings are suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The symptoms include fever, arthralgias, fatigue, weight loss, and a characteristic malar rash. The presence of anti-Sm antibodies is highly specific for SLE. In SLE, there is an autoimmune response against nuclear components, leading to the formation of immune complexes. One of the key pathological processes in SLE is the ineffective clearance of apoptotic cells and cellular debris, which leads to the exposure of nuclear antigens and subsequent autoantibody production. This process is central to the pathogenesis of SLE.",9
4334,"The patient is a 78-year-old woman from New Jersey presenting with fever, lethargy, and bloody urine. Key findings include hepatosplenomegaly, petechiae, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated bilirubin, and elevated LDH with low haptoglobin, suggesting hemolytic anemia. The peripheral blood smear (not visible here) likely shows intraerythrocytic parasites. 

Given the geographic location (New Jersey) and the time of year (July), Babesiosis is a strong consideration. Babesiosis is transmitted by Ixodes ticks, common in the northeastern United States, and can cause hemolytic anemia, fever, and splenomegaly. The laboratory findings are consistent with hemolysis (elevated indirect bilirubin, low haptoglobin, elevated LDH), and the peripheral blood smear would show intraerythrocytic parasites, which are characteristic of Babesia.

Malaria is less likely due to the lack of travel history to endemic areas. Plague and leishmaniasis are also unlikely given the presentation and geographic location.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Babesiosis.",9
4340,"The patient is a 24-year-old primigravida at 31 weeks gestation with a blood pressure of 145/90 mm Hg, which indicates gestational hypertension since there is no proteinuria and no signs of preeclampsia. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated, and she has no symptoms or edema. The systolic murmur is likely a benign flow murmur due to increased cardiac output during pregnancy. The best management for gestational hypertension without severe features is to monitor the patient in an outpatient setting, as her blood pressure is not severely elevated and there are no signs of end-organ damage or fetal distress. Therefore, observation in the outpatient setting is appropriate.",9
4344,"The patient has a thyroid nodule with neoplastic follicular cells and a RAS mutation. The RAS mutation is often associated with follicular thyroid carcinoma or follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma. The nodule is small (0.4 cm) and the TSH level is normal, indicating euthyroid status. Given the presence of neoplastic cells and the RAS mutation, there is a concern for malignancy, although the small size of the nodule might suggest a less aggressive approach. However, watchful waiting is not appropriate due to the neoplastic nature of the cells. Radioiodine therapy is not indicated for a small, potentially malignant nodule without confirmed malignancy. Total thyroidectomy is too aggressive for a small nodule without confirmed malignancy. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is a thyroid lobectomy to allow for histopathological examination and definitive diagnosis.",9
4345,"The patient's symptoms and lab findings suggest primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), an autoimmune disease that primarily affects middle-aged women. The key features include pruritus, fatigue, right upper quadrant pain, and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels. The presence of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis supports an autoimmune etiology. In PBC, there is often an association with hyperlipidemia, specifically elevated cholesterol levels, due to impaired bile acid excretion. Other findings like skin hyperpigmentation can occur but are less specific. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies are more associated with conditions like granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Personality changes are not typical of PBC. Therefore, hyperlipidemia is the most likely additional finding.",9
4346,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with allergic rhinitis, as indicated by sneezing, clear nasal discharge, and red, swollen turbinates. The most appropriate treatment for allergic rhinitis is an antihistamine, which can help alleviate these symptoms. Desloratadine is a second-generation antihistamine that is effective for treating allergic rhinitis and has a lower risk of sedation compared to first-generation antihistamines. Theophylline is a bronchodilator used for asthma and COPD, not for allergic rhinitis. Nizatidine is an H2 blocker used for gastric acid conditions, and amoxicillin is an antibiotic used for bacterial infections, neither of which are appropriate for allergic rhinitis. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition is desloratadine.",9
4348,"The patient is a post-bone marrow transplant recipient presenting with fever, shortness of breath, and diffuse bilateral interstitial infiltrates on chest X-ray. He is also pp65 antigen positive, which is indicative of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. CMV is a common opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients, such as those who have undergone bone marrow transplantation. The presence of pp65 antigen is a specific marker for active CMV infection. Given these findings, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is ganciclovir, which is the treatment of choice for CMV infections in immunocompromised patients.",9
4354,"The patient presents with sudden-onset numbness affecting the left side of his face, arm, and leg, without any motor deficits or cranial nerve abnormalities. This pattern suggests a sensory issue rather than a motor one. A middle cerebral artery stroke typically affects both motor and sensory pathways and often involves the face and arm more than the leg, and would likely cause motor deficits. A conversion disorder is a psychiatric condition and would not be the first consideration given the patient's age and risk factors. A basilar artery stroke would likely cause more diffuse symptoms, including cranial nerve deficits, due to its involvement with the brainstem. A thalamic stroke, however, can cause pure sensory loss because the thalamus is a major relay center for sensory information. Given the patient's symptoms and risk factors, a thalamic stroke is the most likely explanation.",9
4358,"The patient has a heterozygous mutation that prevents HIV from entering macrophages. HIV entry into macrophages and T-cells typically involves the virus binding to the CD4 receptor and a co-receptor, which is usually CCR5 or CXCR4. A mutation in the CCR5 gene, such as the CCR5-Δ32 mutation, can prevent HIV from entering cells by blocking the virus's ability to use CCR5 as a co-receptor. This mutation is known to confer resistance to HIV infection in individuals who are homozygous for the mutation and can slow disease progression in heterozygous individuals. The elevated beta-d-glucan and the clinical presentation suggest Pneumocystis pneumonia, common in immunocompromised patients like those with untreated HIV. The mutation affecting CCR5 is consistent with the patient's long-term asymptomatic status despite HIV infection.",9
4368,"The 13-year-old boy is experiencing severe hip pain and has a history of similar episodes. He is on hydroxyurea, which is commonly used in sickle cell disease to reduce the frequency of pain crises. The sudden onset of severe pain and the use of hydroxyurea suggest that the boy is likely experiencing a vaso-occlusive crisis due to sickle cell disease. In sickle cell disease, sickled red blood cells obstruct blood flow, leading to ischemia and pain.

Legg-Calve-Perthes disease involves avascular necrosis of the femoral head due to compromised blood supply, which is a similar pathophysiological process involving ischemia and bone necrosis. Therefore, the condition with the same pathophysiology as the likely diagnosis (vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease) is Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, as both involve ischemia and necrosis due to impaired blood flow.",9
4372,"The patient is experiencing migraines, characterized by unilateral, throbbing headaches with associated nausea and photophobia. These headaches have increased in frequency and intensity, indicating a need for preventive therapy. Propranolol, a beta-blocker, is commonly used for migraine prophylaxis and is effective in reducing the frequency and severity of migraine attacks. Fluoxetine is an antidepressant and not typically used for migraine prevention. Ergotamine and sumatriptan are used for acute migraine treatment, not prevention. Given the need for long-term prevention, propranolol is the most appropriate choice.",9
4378,"The child is experiencing episodes consistent with night terrors, which are a type of parasomnia. Night terrors typically occur during non-REM sleep, specifically during slow-wave sleep (SWS), which is characterized by delta waves. These episodes usually happen in the first third of the night, aligning with the description of occurring within four hours of sleep onset. During these episodes, the child is difficult to arouse and does not remember the event, which is typical of night terrors. Therefore, the EEG waveform most strongly associated with this condition is delta waves.",9
4380,"The patient's symptoms are suggestive of osteoarthritis, characterized by joint pain and stiffness, particularly in the hands, with involvement of the distal interphalangeal joints. The morning stiffness lasting 15-20 minutes is typical for osteoarthritis, as opposed to rheumatoid arthritis, which usually has stiffness lasting longer than 30 minutes. The burning quality and numbness could suggest some nerve involvement, but the primary concern here is the joint pain. Given her history of recurrent gastric ulcers, NSAIDs like aspirin would not be ideal due to the risk of exacerbating her ulcers. Hydroxychloroquine is used for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, not osteoarthritis. Infliximab is a biologic used for rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions, not osteoarthritis. Acetaminophen is a safer choice for pain management in osteoarthritis, especially considering her history of gastric ulcers.",9
4394,"The patient's symptoms of eye redness, itching, watering, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea occurring annually in late spring suggest allergic rhinitis, likely due to seasonal allergens such as pollen. The history of sinus polyp and family history of asthma further support an atopic condition. Allergic rhinitis is a type I hypersensitivity reaction, which involves the production of IgE antibodies by B cells in response to an allergen. These IgE antibodies bind to mast cells, leading to their sensitization. Upon re-exposure to the allergen, cross-linking of IgE on mast cells occurs, resulting in degranulation and the release of histamine and other mediators. Histamine release is responsible for the symptoms of itching, redness, and increased mucus production. Therefore, the excessive release of histamine by mast cells is a key part of the pathogenesis of this condition.",9
4398,"The patient presents with fever, severe back pain, and laboratory findings suggestive of an infection. The MRI shows a peripherally enhancing dorsal epidural process, which is indicative of an epidural abscess. The presence of multiple injection marks around the cubital fossa and hand veins strongly suggests intravenous drug use. Intravenous drug use is a well-known risk factor for the development of spinal epidural abscesses due to the potential for introducing bacteria directly into the bloodstream, which can then seed the epidural space. Other factors like increased BMI, inhaled steroid use, and smoking are less directly associated with the formation of an epidural abscess compared to intravenous drug use.",9
4399,"The patient presents with acute knee pain, fever, and a warm, tender joint, which raises suspicion for septic arthritis. In such cases, it is crucial to confirm the diagnosis by obtaining synovial fluid for analysis. Arthrocentesis allows for the examination of the synovial fluid to check for infection, crystals, and other abnormalities. This procedure is essential to differentiate between septic arthritis and other causes of acute arthritis, such as gout or a flare of osteoarthritis. Administering antibiotics without confirming the diagnosis could lead to inappropriate treatment. Therefore, the best next step in management is to perform an arthrocentesis to obtain synovial fluid for analysis.",9
4397,"The patient presents with hypertension, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis (elevated bicarbonate), and low serum renin activity. These findings suggest a condition characterized by excess mineralocorticoid activity. The low serum renin activity indicates that the renin-angiotensin system is suppressed, which is consistent with primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome). An aldosteronoma, or adrenal adenoma producing aldosterone, is a common cause of primary hyperaldosteronism. This condition leads to increased sodium reabsorption, potassium excretion, and hydrogen ion excretion, resulting in hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. Renal artery stenosis would typically present with high renin activity due to decreased perfusion pressure. Cushing syndrome can cause hypertension and hypokalemia but would not typically present with low renin activity. Pheochromocytoma is characterized by episodic hypertension and would not cause hypokalemia or low renin activity.",9
4402,"The patient presents with a history of easy bleeding and a swollen, painful knee after minor trauma, suggesting a bleeding disorder. The coagulation panel shows a normal PT and an elevated PTT, indicating a problem with the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade. The normal ristocetin cofactor assay suggests normal platelet function, ruling out platelet function disorders like Bernard-Soulier disease and Glanzmann thrombasthenia. The mixing study shows correction with factor VIII, indicating a deficiency in factor VIII, which is consistent with Hemophilia A. Hemophilia B would show correction with factor IX, which is not the case here.",9
4400,"The patient presents with jaundice, fever, and right upper quadrant tenderness, along with a history of significant alcohol use (130 g/day for 25 years). The laboratory findings show an AST to ALT ratio greater than 2:1, which is characteristic of alcoholic liver disease. The clinical presentation and history are suggestive of alcoholic hepatitis. In alcoholic hepatitis, liver biopsy typically shows the presence of Mallory-Denk bodies, which are cytoplasmic inclusions found in hepatocytes. These are indicative of alcoholic liver damage. The other options are less likely: 'Florid' bile duct lesions are associated with primary biliary cholangitis, steatosis alone would suggest simple fatty liver without inflammation, and Hürthle cells are related to thyroid pathology.",9

4414,"The patient is likely pregnant, given her missed period, nausea, and signs of breast and uterine enlargement. The cyanosis and softening in the cervical and vaginal regions are consistent with early pregnancy changes. During pregnancy, estriol is the predominant estrogen, produced by the placenta. Estriol levels increase significantly during pregnancy, potentially up to 1000-fold, as the placenta grows and the pregnancy progresses. Estrone and estradiol are present but in lower concentrations compared to estriol during pregnancy. Therefore, the statement about estriol levels rising significantly is correct.",9
4425,"The patient presents with left lower quadrant abdominal pain, fever, and a positive fecal occult blood test, which are suggestive of diverticulitis. The leukocyte count is low, which is atypical for an infection, but it could be due to recent surgery or other factors. The most appropriate next step in management for suspected diverticulitis is to confirm the diagnosis with imaging. A CT scan of the abdomen is the preferred imaging modality for diagnosing diverticulitis as it can show inflammation, abscesses, or other complications. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to perform a CT abdomen.",9
4419,"The patient's presentation is consistent with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), characterized by lower abdominal pain, cervical motion tenderness, and cervical exudate. The presence of a tubular complex lesion on ultrasound suggests possible tubo-ovarian abscess, which can occur with PID. The patient's history of unprotected sex and fever further supports this diagnosis. The most appropriate initial treatment for PID, especially with potential complications like a tubo-ovarian abscess, is broad-spectrum antibiotics. Cefoxitin and doxycycline are commonly used to cover the likely pathogens, including Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis, as well as anaerobes and other organisms. Therefore, the most appropriate initial step in treatment is option A.",9
4421,"The patient presents with signs of significant abdominal trauma, including hypotension, abdominal distension, rebound tenderness, guarding, and hyperresonance to percussion, suggesting pneumoperitoneum (free air in the abdomen). The presence of free air on FAST and the clinical picture of peritonitis indicate a likely perforated viscus, which is a surgical emergency. The patient's hemodynamic instability, despite aggressive fluid resuscitation, further supports the need for immediate surgical intervention. In such cases, the next best step is an emergency laparotomy to address the source of bleeding and repair any perforation. CT scan and diagnostic peritoneal lavage are not appropriate due to the urgency and instability of the patient. Laparoscopy is not typically used in unstable patients with suspected perforated viscus and significant intra-abdominal injury.",9
4426,"The patient presents with symptoms and physical exam findings suggestive of a pleural effusion, likely due to hemothorax. The history of a fall, combined with the dullness to percussion and decreased fremitus over the left lung base, suggests fluid accumulation in the pleural space. The patient's COPD and smoking history, along with the acute presentation following trauma, make blood in the pleural space (hemothorax) the most likely cause. Pneumothorax (air between the pleura and chest wall) would typically present with hyperresonance rather than dullness. Bacterial infection in the pulmonary parenchyma (pneumonia) would more likely cause fever and increased fremitus. Fluid in the alveoli (pulmonary edema) would not typically cause dullness to percussion localized to one side.",9
4428,"The patient presents with acute lower back pain following physical exertion, likely due to muscle strain. The absence of midline spinal tenderness and a negative straight leg raise test suggest that there is no significant nerve root involvement or herniated disc. His vital signs are stable, and there is no fever, which makes an infectious cause like epidural abscess less likely, despite his history of IV drug use. The recent urethritis treated with antibiotics does not suggest a direct link to his current symptoms. Given these findings, the most appropriate management for acute musculoskeletal back pain is conservative treatment with analgesia and maintaining regular activity, rather than imaging or further diagnostic testing.",9
4431,"The patient is likely suffering from CMV retinitis, given his low CD4+ count and visual symptoms. The question describes a drug that is phosphorylated by human proteins but not by viral proteins. This is characteristic of Cidofovir, which does not require phosphorylation by viral kinases (unlike Ganciclovir, which requires phosphorylation by CMV proteins). Foscarnet does not require phosphorylation at all, and Oseltamivir is an antiviral for influenza, not CMV. Therefore, the drug that matches the description is Cidofovir.",9
4438,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of esophageal candidiasis, which is common in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS. The presence of oral thrush (white plaques on buccal mucosa and tongue) and odynophagia (pain with swallowing) supports this suspicion. Given her age and recent stressors, it's possible she could have an undiagnosed immunocompromising condition. The next step in management should be to assess her immune status, particularly her CD4 count, to evaluate for potential HIV infection.",9
4437,"The patient presents with signs of an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, as indicated by the presence of melena (dark, tarry stools) and hemodynamic instability (tachycardia and hypotension). The use of naproxen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), increases the risk of peptic ulcer disease, which is a common cause of upper GI bleeding. Given these findings, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to identify and potentially treat the source of the upper GI bleed.",9
4436,"The patient's symptoms of large bruises, fatigue, joint pain, mucosal bleeding, and skin changes such as coiled hairs with perifollicular hemorrhages are indicative of scurvy, which is caused by vitamin C deficiency. Scurvy is characterized by impaired collagen synthesis, leading to bleeding, bruising, and poor wound healing. The patient's poor nutritional intake, as indicated by his cachectic appearance and low BMI, supports the likelihood of a vitamin deficiency. Therefore, administration of vitamin C is most likely to improve his symptoms.",9
4434,"The patient's dry, non-productive cough is a common side effect associated with the use of ACE inhibitors. Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor, and it can cause a persistent dry cough in some patients due to the accumulation of bradykinin. Aspirin, hydrochlorothiazide, and nifedipine are not typically associated with causing a dry cough. Therefore, the medication most likely associated with the patient's cough is lisinopril.",9
4435,"The virus described in the question is likely a rotavirus, which is a member of the Reoviridae family. Rotaviruses have a segmented RNA genome, which allows for reassortment when two different strains infect the same cell. This reassortment results in progeny with genome segments from both parental strains. 

The phenomenon of reassortment is characteristic of viruses with segmented genomes. Among the options given, orthomyxoviruses (such as influenza viruses) also have segmented RNA genomes. Influenza viruses have 8 segments and can undergo reassortment, leading to new viral strains. 

Flaviviruses and picornaviruses have non-segmented RNA genomes, so they do not undergo reassortment. Retroviruses have a diploid genome but do not have segmented genomes, so they also do not undergo reassortment.

Therefore, the viral family that also exhibits reassortment is the Orthomyxoviridae.",9
4439,"The patient presents with fever, fatigue, and laboratory findings of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, along with elevated liver enzymes. He recently returned from a hiking trip in Alabama. These symptoms and lab findings are suggestive of a tick-borne illness. Ehrlichiosis is a tick-borne disease common in the southeastern and south-central United States, including Alabama. It often presents with fever, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes, which matches this patient's presentation. Influenza typically presents with respiratory symptoms, which are absent here. Lyme disease is associated with a characteristic rash (erythema migrans) and is more common in the northeastern United States. Rocky Mountain spotted fever also presents with a rash, which is not noted in this patient. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Ehrlichiosis.",9
4447,"The patient is a 15-year-old girl with a history of irregular menstrual cycles and recent amenorrhea. She is on risperidone for bipolar disorder. Her prolactin level is normal, which suggests that hyperprolactinemia due to risperidone is not the cause of her amenorrhea. Her FSH and LH levels are normal, indicating that primary ovarian insufficiency is unlikely. The progesterone level is low, consistent with anovulation, as progesterone would be higher in the luteal phase if ovulation had occurred. Anovulatory cycles are common in adolescents due to immaturity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Uterine leiomyomas are unlikely in a 15-year-old and would not typically cause amenorrhea. Therefore, the most likely cause of her symptoms is anovulatory cycles, which are common in adolescents.",9
4449,"The patient's symptoms and the specific test described are indicative of an injury to the supraspinatus tendon. The test described is the ""empty can"" test, which is used to assess the integrity of the supraspinatus muscle and tendon. In this test, the arm is abducted to 90 degrees, flexed forward by 30 degrees, and internally rotated (thumb pointing down), and the patient resists downward pressure. Pain or weakness during this maneuver suggests a supraspinatus tendon injury, commonly associated with subacromial tenderness and impingement.",9
4448,"The patient has a history of HIV with a low CD4 count (90/μL), which makes him susceptible to opportunistic infections and certain malignancies. The MRI shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion in the brain, which is a key finding. In HIV patients, the differential diagnosis for ring-enhancing brain lesions includes toxoplasmosis and primary CNS lymphoma. However, the PCR of the cerebrospinal fluid is positive for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA, which is strongly associated with primary CNS lymphoma in HIV patients. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) typically presents with non-enhancing lesions and is caused by JC virus, not EBV. Glioblastoma is less common in this context and not typically associated with EBV. AIDS dementia complex does not present with ring-enhancing lesions. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma.",9
4450,"The patient's symptoms of frequent nosebleeds, gum bleeding, and heavy menstrual periods suggest a bleeding disorder. The normal platelet count and mild anemia indicate that the issue is not due to thrombocytopenia but rather a platelet function disorder or a coagulation factor deficiency. Von Willebrand disease is a common bleeding disorder that presents with mucocutaneous bleeding and normal platelet count. The next step to confirm a platelet function disorder like von Willebrand disease is to perform platelet aggregation tests, which can help assess platelet function and diagnose conditions like von Willebrand disease.",9
4456,"The patient is a 15-year-old boy exhibiting symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder (MDD), including irritability, anhedonia (loss of interest in baseball), trouble concentrating, insomnia, and feelings of guilt. In adolescents, irritability can be a prominent symptom of depression. The first-line treatment for MDD in adolescents typically involves selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Escitalopram is an SSRI and is approved for use in adolescents with depression. Buspirone is primarily used for anxiety disorders, quetiapine is an antipsychotic, and venlafaxine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) which is not typically first-line for adolescents. Therefore, the best treatment option for this patient is escitalopram.",9
4472,"In assessing the risk of future suicide attempts, the most significant predictor is a history of previous attempts. This is because a past suicide attempt is the strongest indicator of future attempts. While factors such as having a plan, race, and lack of social support can contribute to the risk, they are not as strong predictors as a previous attempt. In this scenario, the patient has already attempted suicide by overdosing on pills, which makes option A the most relevant predictor.",9
4455,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of microcytic anemia (low hemoglobin and low mean corpuscular volume). The clinical signs of pale conjunctivae, inflammation of the corners of the mouth, and brittle nails are consistent with iron deficiency anemia. Given her recent history of infectious mononucleosis, it is unlikely to be the cause of her anemia. Her regular menstrual cycles could contribute to iron deficiency due to blood loss. The family history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is not directly relevant to the anemia. The most appropriate initial step in management is to confirm iron deficiency by ordering iron studies, which will help determine if the anemia is due to iron deficiency.",9
4477,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of lupus nephritis, including hematuria, proteinuria, and renal impairment. The renal biopsy confirms lupus nephritis. In cases of lupus nephritis, especially when there is significant renal involvement, the initial treatment typically involves immunosuppressive therapy to control inflammation and prevent further kidney damage. Corticosteroids are often used as the first line of treatment to quickly reduce inflammation. Cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil may be added for more severe cases or specific classes of lupus nephritis. However, the question asks for the next best step, which typically involves starting with corticosteroids to rapidly control the inflammation.",9
4479,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are suggestive of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The key features include episodes of syncope, exertional shortness of breath, and palpitations. The systolic ejection murmur that increases with Valsalva maneuver and standing is characteristic of HCM due to dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The ECG findings of deep S waves in V1 and tall R waves in V5 and V6 indicate left ventricular hypertrophy. In HCM, echocardiography typically shows asymmetric septal hypertrophy, which can lead to abnormal movement of the mitral valve, specifically systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve. This abnormal movement contributes to the obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract. Therefore, the echocardiography is most likely to show abnormal movement of the mitral valve.",9
4471,"The patient is a 36-year-old woman with elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and positive antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA). These findings are highly suggestive of a cholestatic liver disease. The liver biopsy shows inflammatory infiltrate surrounding the biliary ducts, which is characteristic of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). PBC is an autoimmune disease that primarily affects middle-aged women and is associated with positive AMA and elevated ALP due to bile duct damage. The other options do not fit the clinical picture: hepatic amyloidosis would not typically present with positive AMA, fascioliasis is a parasitic infection not associated with AMA, and pancreatic cancer would not present with these specific serological and histological findings.",10
4481,"The biochemist is attributing his own feelings of being a failure onto his wife, despite her supportive statement. This is an example of projection, where an individual misattributes their own unacceptable thoughts or feelings to another person.",9
4482,"The patient's symptoms are characteristic of trigeminal neuralgia. She experiences sharp, stabbing, electric-like pain on one side of her face, which is typical for this condition. The pain is triggered by activities such as laughing, speaking, or eating, and the episodes are brief, lasting about 3 minutes. These features align with trigeminal neuralgia, which involves the trigeminal nerve and causes intense facial pain. The absence of neurological deficits and the normal pupillary reflexes further support this diagnosis. Bell’s palsy would involve facial muscle weakness, cluster headaches would present with severe unilateral headache and autonomic symptoms, and basilar migraine would have different neurological symptoms. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is trigeminal neuralgia.",9
4491,"The patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest spinal cord compression, likely due to metastatic cancer. The multiple sclerotic lesions in the vertebrae are characteristic of metastatic prostate cancer, which commonly spreads to the bone and causes sclerotic (osteoblastic) lesions. The neurological symptoms, including weakness, sensory loss, and urinary incontinence, are consistent with spinal cord compression. Prostate cancer is known for causing osteoblastic metastases, and an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level would be expected in this scenario. Other options, such as a thyroid nodule, elevated carcinoembryonic antigen, or an irregular mole, are less consistent with the presentation of sclerotic bone lesions.",9
4492,"The patient presents with macrocytic anemia (MCV 104 fL) and low reticulocyte count, indicating ineffective erythropoiesis. The normal folate and vitamin B12 levels rule out deficiencies in these vitamins as causes of the macrocytosis. The presence of ringed sideroblasts in the bone marrow aspirate suggests a sideroblastic anemia, which is often associated with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). MDS can progress to acute myelocytic leukemia (AML), especially in older patients. The other options (Sézary syndrome, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and Burkitt lymphoma) are not typically associated with macrocytic anemia with ringed sideroblasts. Therefore, the most likely progression for this patient is to develop acute myelocytic leukemia.",9
4484,"The patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), likely due to recent clindamycin use. The positive enzyme immunoassay for glutamate dehydrogenase antigen and toxins A and B confirms the diagnosis. The most appropriate treatment for CDI is oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin. However, the patient has a history of urticaria and shortness of breath with vancomycin, suggesting an allergic reaction. Therefore, fidaxomicin is the preferred treatment in this case. Fidaxomicin works by inhibiting the RNA polymerase sigma subunit, which is crucial for bacterial transcription.",10
4495,"The clinical presentation of chronic constipation, abdominal distension, and delayed passage of meconium in a 2-year-old suggests Hirschsprung disease. This condition is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal colon, leading to a lack of peristalsis and functional obstruction. The absence of these ganglion cells is due to a failure of neural crest cells to migrate during development. The diagnostic biopsy for Hirschsprung disease typically involves examining the submucosa for the absence of ganglion cells, as these cells are located in the submucosal (Meissner's) and myenteric (Auerbach's) plexuses. Therefore, the submucosa is the layer where the pathologic finding of absent ganglion cells would be identified.",9
4500,"The patient is a 16-year-old female with secondary amenorrhea, low BMI, and signs suggestive of an eating disorder (dorsal hand calluses from possible self-induced vomiting and fine hair, which could indicate lanugo). These findings are consistent with the female athlete triad, which includes low energy availability (often due to disordered eating), menstrual dysfunction, and low bone density. The stress from gymnastics and the low BMI suggest she may have low estrogen levels, leading to decreased bone density. Therefore, low bone density is a likely finding in this patient.",9
4496,"Given the patient's history of intravenous drug use and alcohol abuse, the elevated liver enzymes suggest a possible viral hepatitis infection. Hepatitis C is commonly associated with intravenous drug use. Hepatitis C virus RNA testing is the most appropriate initial test to confirm active infection, as it directly detects the presence of the virus. Hepatitis A and E are typically transmitted via the fecal-oral route and are less likely given the patient's history. Hepatitis D requires co-infection with Hepatitis B, which is not indicated here. Therefore, the most logical test to order first is Hepatitis C virus RNA.",9
4507,"The mother is positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) and anti-hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HbcAg), indicating she has an active hepatitis B infection. The newborn is at risk of acquiring hepatitis B from the mother. To prevent transmission, the standard of care is to administer both hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and the hepatitis B vaccine to the newborn within 12 hours of birth. This combination provides immediate passive immunity from HBIG and active immunity from the vaccine. The presence of hepatitis C RNA and reactive hepatitis C antibody in the mother indicates an active hepatitis C infection, but there is no immediate postnatal prophylaxis for hepatitis C in newborns, and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir is not used in this context. Therefore, the correct answer is to administer both HBIG and the hepatitis B vaccine to the newborn.",9
4508,"The patient has been diagnosed with an infection by Fasciolopsis buski, a large intestinal fluke. The treatment of choice for Fasciolopsis buski is praziquantel. Praziquantel is effective against a variety of trematodes and cestodes, including Fasciolopsis buski. The other options listed are not effective against this particular parasite. Bethional is not a recognized treatment for parasitic infections, niclosamide is used for tapeworms, and oxamniquine is used for Schistosoma mansoni infections.",9
4505,"The patient presents with cognitive decline, visual hallucinations, and parkinsonian features (tremor, slow gait, stooped posture). These symptoms are suggestive of Lewy body dementia (LBD). LBD is characterized by fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations, and parkinsonism. The presence of a tremor that attenuates with voluntary movement and the cognitive symptoms align with this diagnosis. 

Haloperidol (A) is an antipsychotic that can worsen parkinsonian symptoms and is generally avoided in LBD due to sensitivity to neuroleptics.

Penicillamine (B) is used for Wilson's disease, which is not indicated here as the ceruloplasmin level is normal and there are no other signs of Wilson's disease.

Rivastigmine (C) is a cholinesterase inhibitor used in the management of dementia, including Alzheimer's and Lewy body dementia. It can help with cognitive symptoms and may also help with hallucinations.

Ropinirole (D) is a dopamine agonist used for Parkinson's disease, but it is not typically used for managing dementia symptoms.

Given the symptoms and the likely diagnosis of Lewy body dementia, the most appropriate management is Rivastigmine (C).",9
4512,"The infant presents with features suggestive of Down syndrome, including midface hypoplasia, flat nasal bridge, upslanting palpebral fissures, and a holosystolic murmur indicative of a congenital heart defect (commonly seen in Down syndrome). Down syndrome is most commonly caused by trisomy 21, which results from meiotic non-disjunction, especially in older maternal age. The karyotype analysis is ordered to confirm this suspicion. Uniparental disomy, genomic imprinting, and partial deletion are not typical causes of Down syndrome.",9
4525,"The patient presents with painless, raised lesions on the vulva that turn white with acetic acid application, which is characteristic of genital warts caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). The negative HIV test rules out immunocompromise as a contributing factor. The most appropriate treatment for genital warts is a method that directly removes or destroys the lesions. Cryotherapy is a common treatment for genital warts, as it involves freezing the lesions, leading to their destruction. Parenteral benzathine penicillin is used for syphilis, which typically presents with a painless ulcer (chancre), not warts. Radiotherapy is not used for genital warts. Oral acyclovir is used for herpes simplex virus infections, which present with painful vesicular lesions, not warts.",9
4523,"The question describes a medication that works by blocking the reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys, leading to glucose excretion in the urine. This mechanism is characteristic of SGLT2 inhibitors. Among the options provided, Canagliflozin is an SGLT2 inhibitor, which fits this description. Exenatide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist, Glyburide is a sulfonylurea, and Metformin is a biguanide. None of these other medications work by promoting glucose excretion in the urine.",9
4524,"The patient presents with intermittent episodes of dark urine, mild flank pain, and laboratory findings of hematuria and proteinuria. He has a history of sickle cell trait and chronic use of NSAIDs (aspirin and ibuprofen). Sickle cell trait can lead to renal complications, particularly in the renal medulla, due to the low oxygen tension and hypertonicity, which can cause sickling of red blood cells. This can result in renal papillary necrosis due to ischemia. Additionally, chronic NSAID use can exacerbate this condition by reducing renal blood flow through inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, further contributing to renal papillary ischemia. The presence of sickle cell trait and NSAID use makes renal papillary ischemia the most likely underlying cause of the hematuria in this patient.",9
4513,"The clinical presentation of a midline neck swelling that moves with swallowing and tongue protrusion is characteristic of a thyroglossal duct cyst. These cysts arise from remnants of the thyroglossal duct, which is an embryologic structure that forms as the thyroid gland descends from the foramen cecum at the base of the tongue to its final position in the neck. The thyroglossal duct is derived from the midline endoderm of the pharynx. Therefore, the embryologic origin of the nodule in this patient is the midline endoderm of the pharynx.",9
4526,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of infective endocarditis, particularly affecting the tricuspid valve, which is common in intravenous drug users. The presence of a holosystolic murmur near the lower left sternal border and echocardiographic evidence of vegetations on the tricuspid valve support this diagnosis. In intravenous drug users, the most common causative organism of tricuspid valve endocarditis is Staphylococcus aureus. Other options like Streptococcus bovis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus mutans are less commonly associated with this presentation, especially in the context of IV drug use.",9
4529,"The patient's symptoms and lab findings suggest multiple myeloma. The key indicators are the progressive fatigue, back pain, anemia (hemoglobin 10.5 g/dl), and hypercalcemia (serum calcium 11.1 mg/dl). The x-ray of the skull, although not visible here, likely shows lytic lesions, which are characteristic of multiple myeloma. To confirm the diagnosis, serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) is the most appropriate next step as it can detect the presence of a monoclonal protein (M protein), which is a hallmark of multiple myeloma.",9
4536,"The patient presents with painless, skin-colored, flattened, and papilliform lesions on the penile shaft and around the anus. These lesions turn white upon the application of acetic acid, which is characteristic of genital warts caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). The types of HPV most commonly associated with genital warts are types 6 and 11. Types 16 and 18 are more commonly associated with high-risk lesions that can lead to cancer, such as cervical cancer, but are not typically associated with the appearance of genital warts. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and HSV type 2 do not cause lesions that match this description. Therefore, the etiology of these lesions is most likely HPV types 6 and 11.",9
4541,"The CCR5 mutation affects the entry of HIV into host cells. HIV entry involves the viral envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41. gp120 binds to the CD4 receptor on host cells and then interacts with a co-receptor, usually CCR5 or CXCR4. In individuals with a homozygous CCR5 mutation, the CCR5 co-receptor is non-functional, preventing gp120 from binding effectively. This blocks the virus from entering the host cell. Therefore, the CCR5 mutation interferes with the function of gp120, which is responsible for binding to the co-receptor.",9
4538,"The patient presents with symptoms of hyperthyroidism (palpitations, weight loss, hair loss) and has a low TSH level with elevated T4 and T3 levels, indicating hyperthyroidism. The thyroid scan shows increased uptake in a nodule with suppression of the rest of the thyroid, suggesting a hyperfunctioning (""hot"") nodule. This is characteristic of a toxic adenoma, which is often due to a gain-of-function mutation in the TSH receptor, leading to autonomous hormone production by the nodule.",9
4545,"The anterior spinal artery supplies the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord, which includes the anterior horn cells and the spinothalamic tracts. A lesion in this area would typically result in loss of motor function (due to damage to the anterior horn cells) and loss of pain and temperature sensation (due to damage to the spinothalamic tracts), while preserving the dorsal columns, which carry proprioception and vibratory sense. Therefore, preserved pressure sensation (which is carried by the dorsal columns) would be expected in an anterior spinal artery syndrome, as the dorsal columns are not affected.",9
4550,The patient's symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness and episodes of muscle weakness triggered by emotions (such as laughter) are indicative of narcolepsy with cataplexy. The best first-line pharmacological treatment for excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy is Modafinil. Modafinil is a wakefulness-promoting agent that is commonly used to treat narcolepsy and is preferred due to its efficacy and lower side effect profile compared to traditional stimulants.,9
4552,"The patient presents with retrosternal pain after self-induced vomiting, which is suggestive of esophageal perforation, specifically Boerhaave syndrome. The contrast esophagram shows mild leakage of contrast from the lower esophagus into the mediastinum, confirming the diagnosis. In such cases, the immediate management involves preventing infection and further complications. The most appropriate next step is to start broad-spectrum antibiotics to prevent mediastinitis, which is a serious complication of esophageal perforation. Therefore, intravenous ampicillin and sulbactam therapy is the correct choice to cover potential pathogens and prevent infection.",9
4557,"The patient has experienced episodes of depression characterized by sadness, difficulty sleeping, and increased appetite. Additionally, she has had periods of increased energy, decreased need for sleep, and decreased appetite, suggesting hypomanic episodes. These alternating episodes of depression and hypomania are indicative of a bipolar spectrum disorder. Cyclothymic disorder is characterized by numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms and depressive symptoms that do not meet the full criteria for a major depressive episode, persisting for at least 2 years. The patient's symptoms and the duration of her episodes align with cyclothymic disorder.",9
4558,"The child's developmental milestones provide clues to his age. He can bend down and stand back up without assistance and walk backward, which are skills typically seen around 15-18 months. He is not yet able to run or walk upstairs, which are skills that usually develop closer to 24 months. The ability to stack 2 blocks is consistent with a 15-month-old, as children around this age can stack 2-3 blocks. His language skills include saying ""mama"" and ""dada"" specifically for his parents and using a few other words like 'book', 'milk', and 'truck', which aligns with a 15-month-old's vocabulary. Therefore, the child is most likely 15 months old.",9
4563,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of bacterial meningitis, including fever, headache, neck stiffness, and photophobia. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis shows a high leukocyte count with a predominance of neutrophils, elevated protein, and low glucose, which are typical findings in bacterial meningitis. The CT scan shows leptomeningeal enhancement, further supporting this diagnosis.

In elderly patients, the most common organisms causing bacterial meningitis include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Listeria monocytogenes. Empiric treatment should cover these organisms. 

Ceftriaxone is used to cover S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis. Vancomycin is added to cover for resistant strains of S. pneumoniae. Ampicillin is included to cover Listeria monocytogenes, which is particularly important in the elderly population.

Therefore, the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy for this patient is a combination of ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and ampicillin.",10
4565,"The patient is 5 months pregnant and presents with painless vaginal bleeding. Given her history of a previous cesarean section, the most likely cause of her symptoms is placenta previa, where the placenta covers the cervix. Risk factors for placenta previa include previous cesarean delivery, multiparity, advanced maternal age, and smoking. In this case, the most relevant risk factor from the options provided is multiparity, as the patient is G3P2, indicating she has had multiple pregnancies.",9
4569,"The patient is in the ICU with septic shock and has been treated with antibiotics and norepinephrine. Her thyroid function tests show low T3 (0.1 ng/dL) with normal T4 (0.9 ng/dL) and TSH (1.8 μU/mL). This pattern is characteristic of sick euthyroid syndrome, where non-thyroidal illness leads to alterations in thyroid hormone levels, typically with low T3 and normal or low T4, while TSH remains normal. This condition is common in critically ill patients and is not due to intrinsic thyroid disease or pituitary dysfunction. The other options do not fit the clinical picture: medication toxicity would likely affect other systems or show different lab abnormalities, fibrous thyroiditis would present with thyroid gland abnormalities, and pituitary apoplexy would cause more dramatic hormonal changes and symptoms.",9
4577,"The patient presents with painless jaundice, which suggests an increase in bilirubin levels. Given his age and the acute presentation, we should consider conditions that cause unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Crigler-Najjar syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that typically presents in infancy, making it unlikely in this case. Pancreatic cancer is also unlikely due to the patient's young age and lack of other symptoms such as weight loss or abdominal pain. Gilbert syndrome is a common, benign condition that causes mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, often triggered by stress, fasting, or illness, which fits this patient's recent hiking trip and mild cough. Ceftriaxone can cause biliary sludge and jaundice, but this is more associated with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is Gilbert syndrome.",9
4574,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP), a condition characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) in the presence of normal hemoglobin and leukocyte count. The history of recent viral infection (gastroenteritis) followed by bruising and petechiae is typical for ITP in children. In pediatric ITP, especially when the child is otherwise healthy and the platelet count is above 20,000/mm3, the condition is often self-limiting and resolves spontaneously. Therefore, the most appropriate management is observation, as the child is not experiencing severe bleeding and the platelet count is not critically low.",9
4581,"The clinical presentation and family history suggest a diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The key features include scoliosis, skin nodules (likely neurofibromas), and a family history of blindness (possibly due to optic gliomas) and pheochromocytoma (causing high blood pressure). NF1 is known to follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.",9
4587,"The patient's symptoms include worsening headache, double vision, and esotropia (inward turning of the eye) on left-lateral gaze. These symptoms suggest a cranial nerve palsy. The MRI findings show a left-sided intracavernous carotid aneurysm. The abducens nerve (CN VI) is most susceptible to compression in the cavernous sinus because it is located medially and is in close proximity to the internal carotid artery. Compression of the abducens nerve would lead to an inability to abduct the eye, resulting in esotropia, especially noticeable when attempting lateral gaze. This aligns with the patient's presentation of more pronounced esotropia on left-lateral gaze, indicating a left abducens nerve palsy.",9
4590,"The patient is 10 weeks pregnant and desires screening for Down syndrome with minimal risk to herself and the fetus. The options include non-invasive and invasive tests. 

- Option A (Maternal serum screening) is typically done in the second trimester and involves multiple markers, but it is not the most immediate or secure option at 10 weeks.
- Option B (Amniocentesis) is an invasive procedure usually performed after 15 weeks of gestation and carries a risk of miscarriage.
- Option C (Cell-free fetal DNA testing) is a non-invasive test that can be done as early as 10 weeks and provides a high sensitivity and specificity for Down syndrome.
- Option D (Chorionic villus sampling) is an invasive procedure that can be done between 10-13 weeks but carries a risk of miscarriage.

Given the patient's preference for immediate, secure, and low-risk screening, cell-free fetal DNA testing is the most appropriate choice.",9
4585,"The patient is intoxicated, which can impair his ability to make informed decisions. In such cases, the physician has a responsibility to ensure the patient's safety until he is sober enough to make decisions. The most appropriate response is to keep the patient under observation until he is no longer intoxicated and can make an informed decision about his care. Therefore, the physician should explain that the patient needs to stay until he is sober, which aligns with option C.",9
4583,"The patient presents with a rapidly progressing soft tissue infection after exposure to seawater, with symptoms including hemorrhagic blisters and severe tenderness. He has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, which increases susceptibility to certain infections. The blood cultures show gram-negative bacilli that ferment lactose. Vibrio vulnificus is a gram-negative, lactose-fermenting bacillus commonly found in warm seawater and is known to cause severe infections in individuals with liver disease, such as cirrhosis. The clinical presentation and laboratory findings are consistent with an infection caused by Vibrio vulnificus.",9
4595,"The presentation of unilateral foul-smelling nasal discharge in a young child is highly suggestive of a nasal foreign body. This is a common occurrence in children who may insert objects into their nostrils. The absence of trauma, normal sinus X-ray, and lack of tenderness on palpation further support this diagnosis. Bilateral maxillary sinusitis would typically present with bilateral symptoms and possibly fever. A septal hematoma would likely follow trauma and present with nasal obstruction or deformity. A nasal tumor is rare in this age group and would not typically present with sudden onset of symptoms. Therefore, the most likely cause is a nasal foreign body.",9
4591,"The patient's symptoms and findings suggest cardiac amyloidosis. The key features include progressive fatigue, difficulty breathing, lower extremity swelling, enlarged tongue (macroglossia), jugular venous distention on inspiration (Kussmaul's sign), pitting edema, hepatomegaly, and osteolytic lesions on X-ray. The ECG shows low voltage waves, and the echocardiogram shows a speckled appearance of the myocardium with diastolic dysfunction. These findings are consistent with amyloid deposition in the heart, which is known to cause restrictive cardiomyopathy. The mechanism involves the deposition of an extracellular fibrillar protein that stains positive for Congo red in the myocardium, leading to the observed cardiac dysfunction.",9
4598,"The infant in this scenario has a tuft of hair over the lumbosacral region, which is suggestive of a neural tube defect such as spina bifida. The mother has a history of epilepsy and did not take prenatal vitamins, which typically include folic acid. Folic acid deficiency is associated with neural tube defects. Among the medications listed, valproic acid is an antiepileptic drug known to increase the risk of neural tube defects when taken during pregnancy. This is because valproic acid can interfere with folate metabolism, leading to an increased risk of such defects. The other medications listed do not have a strong association with neural tube defects. Therefore, the most likely medication the mother was taking is valproic acid.",9
4601,"The clinical presentation of this 6-year-old boy suggests nephrotic syndrome. Key features include periorbital edema, pitting edema, and frothy urine, which is indicative of proteinuria. The recent history of a sore throat could suggest a post-infectious process, but the lack of hypertension and the presence of significant edema point more towards nephrotic syndrome rather than nephritic syndrome. In nephrotic syndrome, the urinalysis typically shows massive proteinuria and may also show fatty casts due to the presence of lipiduria. RBC casts are more associated with nephritic syndrome, such as post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which would also present with hematuria and hypertension. WBC casts are associated with pyelonephritis or interstitial nephritis. Hyaline casts can be seen in normal individuals or in various renal conditions but are not specific to nephrotic syndrome. Therefore, the presence of fatty casts is most consistent with nephrotic syndrome.",9
4607,"The newborn is presenting with jaundice at 4 days old, which is common in newborns due to physiological jaundice. However, the significant weight loss (10.9% of birth weight) and the low number of wet diapers suggest dehydration and inadequate breastfeeding. This can lead to decreased bilirubin excretion and increased enterohepatic circulation, causing elevated unconjugated bilirubin levels. The total bilirubin is 20 mg/dL with a very low conjugated fraction, indicating unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The mildly sunken fontanelle also supports dehydration. Therefore, the most likely cause of these findings is inadequate breastfeeding, leading to breastfeeding jaundice.",9
4611,"The patient is experiencing acute on chronic heart failure, and the proposed drug trial involves a BNP stabilizing agent. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a hormone produced by the heart in response to ventricular volume expansion and pressure overload. BNP has several effects that help reduce the workload on the heart, including vasodilation, natriuresis, and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). 

Option A, increased water reabsorption by the renal collecting ducts, is incorrect because BNP promotes diuresis, not water reabsorption.

Option B, restricted aldosterone release, is correct because BNP inhibits the RAAS, leading to decreased aldosterone secretion. This results in reduced sodium and water retention, which helps alleviate heart failure symptoms.

Option C, increased potassium release from cardiomyocytes, is not directly related to BNP's actions.

Option D, inhibition of funny sodium channels, is related to heart rate control and not directly influenced by BNP.

Therefore, the expected change with a BNP stabilizing agent would be restricted aldosterone release.",9
4608,"The patient presents with hypopigmented skin lesions on his back that do not tan with sun exposure, which is characteristic of Tinea versicolor. This condition is caused by Malassezia species, a type of yeast that affects the pigmentation of the skin. The presence of fine scaling over the lesions further supports this diagnosis. Mycosis fungoides typically presents with patches, plaques, or tumors and is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, which is less likely given the presentation. Pityriasis rosea usually starts with a herald patch followed by a Christmas tree pattern rash, which does not match the description. Secondary syphilis can cause a rash, but it typically involves more systemic symptoms and a different rash pattern. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Tinea versicolor.",9
4615,"The quadruple screen is a prenatal test that measures four substances in the mother's blood: maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MS-AFP), unconjugated estriol, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and inhibin-A. The pattern of these markers can suggest certain fetal conditions. In this case, the results show low MS-AFP, low unconjugated estriol, high hCG, and high inhibin-A. This pattern is characteristic of Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). In Trisomy 21, MS-AFP and unconjugated estriol are typically low, while hCG and inhibin-A are elevated. Spina bifida and gastroschisis are associated with elevated MS-AFP, and fetal alcohol syndrome does not have a specific pattern on the quadruple screen.",10
4620,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest hereditary spherocytosis. The child has anemia, jaundice, splenomegaly, and an increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), which are characteristic of hereditary spherocytosis. The family history of recurrent anemia also supports a hereditary condition. The red cell distribution width is elevated, indicating variability in red blood cell size, which is common in hemolytic anemias. To confirm hereditary spherocytosis, the eosin-5-maleimide (EMA) binding test is used as it detects the deficiency of proteins in the red blood cell membrane, which is characteristic of this condition.",9
4609,"The patient's HbA1c level of 8.7% indicates poorly controlled diabetes, likely type 2 given her age and weight. In type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance is a key issue, particularly affecting glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Insulin facilitates glucose transport into cells by promoting the translocation of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) to the cell membrane, primarily in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Therefore, in this patient, the glucose transport is most likely affected in the skeletal muscle due to insulin resistance.",9
4635,"The patient is 36 weeks pregnant and presents with vaginal bleeding, mild abdominal pain, and uterine contractions after minor trauma. The ultrasound shows a marginal retroplacental hematoma, indicating a possible placental abruption. The fetal heart rate is normal, and the maternal vital signs are stable. The cervix is closed, and there is no active labor. Given the gestational age of 36 weeks, the fetus is near term, and immediate delivery is not indicated unless there is fetal distress or significant maternal instability. The best approach is to admit the patient for close maternal and fetal monitoring to ensure stability and to watch for any signs of worsening abruption or fetal distress. Therefore, the next best step is to admit for observation and monitoring.",9
4636,"The patient is exhibiting symptoms consistent with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), characterized by persistent fears of contamination and compulsive washing behaviors. SSRIs are a first-line pharmacological treatment for OCD. In addition to medication, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), specifically exposure and response prevention (ERP), is the most effective form of psychotherapy for OCD. CBT helps patients confront their fears and reduce the compulsive behaviors associated with their obsessions. Motivational interviewing is more suited for substance use disorders, psychodynamic psychotherapy focuses on unconscious processes and past experiences, and group therapy is not typically the first-line treatment for OCD.",9
4632,"The patient is in hypovolemic shock, likely due to internal bleeding, as indicated by hypotension, tachycardia, low hematocrit, and the presence of a retroperitoneal fluid collection on FAST. The ecchymoses in the right flank suggest possible retroperitoneal hemorrhage, potentially from a renal or vascular injury. The presence of 6 RBC/HPF in the urinalysis indicates possible renal trauma. Given the hemodynamic instability despite fluid resuscitation, immediate surgical intervention is necessary to control the bleeding. A CT scan would delay treatment and is not appropriate in an unstable patient. A retrograde urethrogram is not indicated as there is no evidence of urethral injury. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is not needed since the FAST exam already indicates fluid collection. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to take the patient to the OR for an exploratory laparotomy to identify and control the source of bleeding.",9
4628,"The patient's symptoms and endoscopic findings suggest a Helicobacter pylori infection, which is known to cause gastric ulcers and inflammation. The biopsy shows gram-negative bacteria, consistent with H. pylori. This bacterium survives in the acidic environment of the stomach by producing urease, an enzyme that hydrolyzes urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide, thereby neutralizing stomach acid and allowing the bacteria to colonize the gastric epithelium.",9
4638,"The vagus nerve plays a crucial role in stimulating gastric secretions. When the vagus nerve is stimulated, it increases the secretion of gastrin from G cells in the stomach. Gastrin, in turn, stimulates the parietal cells to secrete more hydrochloric acid, leading to a decrease in gastric pH. Additionally, vagal stimulation inhibits somatostatin secretion from D cells. Somatostatin normally inhibits gastrin release, so its inhibition further promotes gastrin secretion. Therefore, after vagus nerve stimulation, somatostatin secretion decreases, gastrin secretion increases, and gastric pH decreases.",9
4644,"The newborn is presenting with cyanosis that does not improve with oxygen, suggesting a congenital heart defect with mixing of blood. The echocardiography findings indicate transposition of the great arteries (TGA), where the pulmonary artery and aorta are switched. In TGA, the systemic and pulmonary circulations are parallel rather than in series, leading to severe hypoxemia unless there is mixing of blood through a shunt (e.g., patent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal defect, or ventricular septal defect). The immediate management to ensure adequate mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood is to maintain ductal patency. Prostaglandin E1 is administered to keep the ductus arteriosus open, allowing for mixing of blood and improving oxygenation until definitive surgical repair can be performed.",9
4653,"The clinical presentation of the 3-year-old girl, including delayed growth, anemia, jaundice, and the presence of sickle-shaped RBCs on a peripheral blood smear, is indicative of sickle cell disease. The family history of pulmonary embolism and unexplained pain episodes in the mother suggests a hereditary condition, which aligns with sickle cell disease. The symptoms of anemia and the need for oxygen supplementation further support this diagnosis. Hydroxyurea is the most appropriate treatment for sickle cell disease as it increases fetal hemoglobin production, reducing sickling of RBCs and associated complications.",9
4646,"The patient is presenting with classic symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction (MI), including chest pain radiating to the jaw and left arm, diaphoresis, and anxiety. The elevated troponin levels confirm myocardial injury. The ECG, although not visible here, likely shows changes consistent with an MI. In the setting of an acute MI, the immediate management should focus on reducing myocardial oxygen demand and preventing further thrombus formation. Oral nifedipine (A) is not appropriate as it can cause reflex tachycardia and worsen ischemia. Echocardiography (C) and CT scan of the chest (D) are not immediate management steps for an acute MI. The best next step is to initiate antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel, beta-blockade with atenolol to reduce heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand, and anticoagulation to prevent further clot propagation. Therefore, the best next step is option B.",9
4661,"The paired fibrous structures described in the question are the cardinal ligaments (also known as the transverse cervical ligaments). These ligaments extend from the cervix and the lateral part of the fornix of the vagina to the lateral pelvic walls. The uterine artery, which is a branch of the internal iliac artery, runs within the cardinal ligament. This artery is crucial for supplying blood to the uterus. The other options do not run within the cardinal ligament: the superior vesical artery supplies the bladder, the artery of Sampson is a small artery found in the round ligament, and the ovarian artery arises from the abdominal aorta and supplies the ovaries.",9
4662,"The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), given the sudden-onset 'thunderclap' headache, neck stiffness, and nausea/vomiting. A normal noncontrast CT scan does not rule out SAH, especially if performed more than 6 hours after symptom onset. The next step to confirm SAH is a lumbar puncture to look for xanthochromia or red blood cells in the cerebrospinal fluid, which would indicate bleeding in the subarachnoid space. IV tPA is used for ischemic stroke, not appropriate here. Diffusion-weighted MRI is more sensitive for ischemic changes but not typically used for SAH diagnosis. A VP shunt is used for hydrocephalus management, not indicated at this stage.",9
4671,"The clinical presentation of this 6-year-old boy suggests a diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Key features include the presence of angiofibromas (facial lesions), a history of seizures, and neurological symptoms such as right lower extremity weakness and headaches. The palpable abdominal mass and left costovertebral angle tenderness could indicate renal involvement, such as angiomyolipomas, which are common in TSC. The neurological symptoms and history of seizures suggest the presence of brain lesions. In TSC, subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) are common brain tumors that can cause increased intracranial pressure, leading to headaches and neurological deficits. Therefore, further evaluation is most likely to show a subependymal giant cell astrocytoma.",9
4681,"The patient experiences syncope or near-syncope episodes specifically when getting dressed, which involves neck movements such as putting on a tie. This suggests a trigger related to neck manipulation. Carotid hypersensitivity syndrome is characterized by syncope triggered by pressure on the carotid sinus, such as turning the head or wearing a tight collar. The normal cardiopulmonary and neurologic exams, along with unremarkable ECG and lab values, make cardiac or neurological causes less likely. Anxiety could cause syncope but is less likely given the specific trigger. Aortic stenosis and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy would likely present with abnormal cardiac findings or exertional syncope, not specifically related to neck movements.",9
4683,"Pyruvate kinase is an enzyme in the glycolytic pathway that catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate, generating ATP in the process. It is subject to regulation by various metabolites. One key regulatory mechanism is feed-forward activation, where an upstream metabolite in the pathway enhances the activity of a downstream enzyme. In glycolysis, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, an intermediate formed earlier in the pathway, acts as an allosteric activator of pyruvate kinase. This ensures that once glycolysis is initiated, the pathway proceeds efficiently to completion. Other options, such as glucose-6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, do not have this specific regulatory role on pyruvate kinase. Alanine is actually an inhibitor of pyruvate kinase, not an activator.",9
4677,"Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic that is known to cause metabolic side effects, including weight gain, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia. These side effects can increase the risk of developing diabetes mellitus. Therefore, long-term monitoring of metabolic parameters is important in patients taking olanzapine. HbA1c levels are used to monitor long-term glucose control and can help in detecting the development of diabetes. While CBC, ECG, and renal function studies are important in other contexts, they are not specifically required for long-term monitoring of olanzapine therapy.",9
4685,"The patient presents with new upper abdominal discomfort and shortness of breath that worsens with exertion, which are concerning for cardiac ischemia, especially given his risk factors: age, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and smoking history. The normal ECG and cardiac enzyme levels do not rule out ischemia, as these can be normal at rest. The symptoms are exertional, suggesting the need for a stress test to evaluate for inducible ischemia. A cardiac pharmacological stress test is appropriate here because it can simulate exercise in patients who may not be able to physically exert themselves due to recent surgery. MRI of the abdomen and culture swab from the surgical site are not indicated given the lack of abdominal findings suggestive of infection or other abdominal pathology. Coronary angiography is more invasive and typically follows non-invasive testing like a stress test if indicated.",9
4684,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of an ovarian tumor, given the adnexal mass, elevated CA-125, and symptoms such as abdominal distension and weight loss. The elevated CA-125 is commonly associated with epithelial ovarian cancers, particularly serous carcinoma. The history of endometriosis can also be associated with certain types of ovarian tumors, but the key here is the elevated CA-125 and the description of the mass. 

The options provided describe different types of ovarian tumors:

- **A. Large undifferentiated germ cells with clear cytoplasm**: This describes dysgerminoma, a type of germ cell tumor, which is less likely given the patient's age and elevated CA-125.

- **B. Small, round cells that form Call-Exner bodies**: This describes a granulosa cell tumor, a type of sex-cord stromal tumor, which is not typically associated with elevated CA-125.

- **C. Atypical epithelial cells along with psammoma bodies**: This describes serous carcinoma, an epithelial ovarian tumor, which is associated with elevated CA-125 and is common in postmenopausal women.

- **D. Spindle-shaped stromal cells along with signet ring cells**: This describes a Krukenberg tumor, which is a metastatic tumor, often from a gastric origin, and is not typically associated with elevated CA-125.

Given the elevated CA-125 and the typical presentation, the most likely microscopic finding is atypical epithelial cells along with psammoma bodies, indicative of serous carcinoma.",9
4687,"To calculate the positive predictive value (PPV), we need to determine the proportion of true positives among all positive test results from the experimental test.

1. **Gold Standard Results:**
   - Total patients = 100
   - Patients with disease X (true positives) = 10% of 100 = 10
   - Patients without disease X (true negatives) = 90% of 100 = 90

2. **Experimental Test Results:**
   - Sensitivity (true positive rate) = 90%
   - Specificity (true negative rate) = 20%

3. **True Positives (TP):**
   - 90% of the 10 true positives are detected by the experimental test.
   - TP = 0.9 * 10 = 9

4. **False Positives (FP):**
   - Specificity is 20%, meaning 80% of those without the disease will test positive.
   - FP = 80% of 90 = 0.8 * 90 = 72

5. **Total Positive Results from Experimental Test:**
   - Total positives = TP + FP = 9 + 72 = 81

6. **Positive Predictive Value (PPV):**
   - PPV = TP / (TP + FP) = 9 / 81 = 0.1111 or 11%

Therefore, the positive predictive value of the experimental test is 11%.",9
4689,"The clinical presentation of this 5-month-old boy suggests a primary immunodeficiency. The key features include recurrent infections (otitis media, bronchiolitis, pneumonia), failure to thrive, oral thrush, and an absent thymic shadow on chest x-ray. The absent thymic shadow is particularly indicative of a T-cell deficiency. The combination of recurrent infections, both bacterial and viral, along with the absent thymic shadow, points towards a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). SCID is characterized by a profound defect in both T-cell and B-cell function, leading to severe immunodeficiency. The presence of oral thrush and recurrent infections in a young infant further supports this diagnosis. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome typically presents with eczema, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent infections, but the absent thymic shadow is more characteristic of SCID. Chronic granulomatous disease involves recurrent bacterial and fungal infections due to defective phagocyte function, but does not typically present with an absent thymic shadow. X-linked agammaglobulinemia presents with recurrent bacterial infections due to a lack of B cells, but the thymus is usually present.",9
4693,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs consistent with acute decompensated heart failure, including orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, weight gain, jugular venous distension, a third heart sound, pulmonary crackles, and peripheral edema. These findings suggest fluid overload. The best initial management for acute decompensated heart failure with fluid overload is to reduce the excess fluid. Loop diuretics, such as bumetanide, are effective in rapidly reducing fluid overload and improving symptoms. Carvedilol, a beta-blocker, is used for long-term management of heart failure but is not appropriate for acute decompensation. Dopamine and milrinone are inotropes used in cases of cardiogenic shock or severe heart failure with low cardiac output, which is not indicated here as the primary issue is fluid overload.",9
4699,"The clinical presentation and CSF findings are consistent with bacterial meningitis in a neonate. The CSF culture shows a Gram-negative rod, which in neonates is often due to organisms like Escherichia coli or other Enterobacteriaceae. Among the options, the K capsule is a virulence factor that helps bacteria evade phagocytosis and is particularly important for E. coli in causing neonatal meningitis. The K capsule allows the bacteria to cross the blood-brain barrier and establish infection in the central nervous system. LPS endotoxin is a general virulence factor for Gram-negative bacteria but is not specific for crossing the blood-brain barrier. IgA protease is more relevant for mucosal infections, and M protein is associated with Streptococcus pyogenes, which is not a Gram-negative rod.",9
4692,"The patient's presentation includes multiple hospital visits with various complaints, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and abdominal pain, without any significant findings on examination or tests. He is also insistent on being admitted despite normal test results and leaves the hospital abruptly. These behaviors suggest a possible secondary gain, such as seeking shelter or food, given his recent homelessness. Malingering is characterized by the intentional production of false or grossly exaggerated physical or psychological symptoms, motivated by external incentives. In this case, the patient's behavior aligns with malingering due to the potential external benefits of hospital admission.",9
4696,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with a manic episode, likely due to bipolar disorder. She has been prescribed multiple antipsychotics without improvement, suggesting the need for a different class of medication. Lithium is a common mood stabilizer used to treat bipolar disorder, especially manic episodes. However, lithium use during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of cardiac defects in the newborn, specifically Ebstein's anomaly, which involves the atrialization of the right ventricle. This aligns with option D, right ventricular atrialization.",9
4704,"The patient's symptoms of recurring headaches, scalp tenderness (pain while combing hair), and neck stiffness suggest possible giant cell arteritis (GCA), especially given her age. GCA is often associated with polymyalgia rheumatica, which could explain her difficulty standing due to lower limb pain. The next best step to support the diagnosis of GCA is to check the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), as it is a quick and non-invasive test that can indicate inflammation. Temporal artery biopsy is confirmatory but is not the immediate next step before ESR.",9
4702,"The patient's symptoms and physical findings are indicative of osteoarthritis. She has pain and stiffness in her fingers and knees, with stiffness lasting about 10 minutes in the morning, which is characteristic of osteoarthritis rather than rheumatoid arthritis (which typically has longer morning stiffness). The pain worsening in the evening is also typical of osteoarthritis. Her BMI indicates obesity, a risk factor for osteoarthritis. The presence of firm nodules on the distal interphalangeal joints (Heberden's nodes) is a classic sign of osteoarthritis. Pseudogout and gout typically affect different joints and have different presentations, and septic arthritis would present with more acute symptoms and systemic signs of infection.",9
4707,"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are indicative of an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. The key details include the popping sound at the time of injury, which is commonly associated with ACL tears, and the positive anterior drawer test, which specifically tests for ACL integrity. The anterior drawer test involves pulling the tibia forward while the knee is bent, and a positive result suggests that the ACL is damaged, allowing excessive forward movement of the tibia relative to the femur. The other options, such as the lateral collateral ligament, posterior cruciate ligament, and ligamentum patellae, do not match the specific test and symptoms described.",9
4726,"The patient's symptoms and findings are consistent with gout. The key details include intermittent pain in the right great toe, which is a common site for gout attacks, and the presence of thin, tapered, needle-shaped intracellular crystals that are strongly negatively birefringent on crystal analysis. These characteristics are classic for monosodium urate crystals, which are responsible for gout. The radiograph findings of joint space narrowing and medial soft tissue swelling further support this diagnosis. Calcium pyrophosphate deposition would suggest pseudogout, which typically shows rhomboid-shaped crystals that are positively birefringent. Tuberculosis and rheumatoid arthritis do not match the crystal analysis findings.",9
4721,"The patient presents with symptoms of vulvar pruritus and dysuria, along with a whitish chunky discharge. The vaginal pH is 4.2, which is within the normal acidic range for the vagina. These findings are suggestive of a yeast infection, most likely caused by Candida species. The wet mount would typically show budding yeast or pseudohyphae in such cases. Given that she is pregnant, oral fluconazole (C) is generally avoided due to potential risks to the fetus. Intravaginal clotrimazole (D) is a safe and effective treatment for vulvovaginal candidiasis during pregnancy. Oral metronidazole (A) is used for bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis, and intravaginal lactobacillus (B) is not a standard treatment for yeast infections.",9
4728,"The patient's symptoms include a frequent need to void, inability to reach the bathroom in time, and urinary leakage both at night and during the day. These symptoms are characteristic of urge incontinence, which is often due to overactive bladder. The normal urinalysis and the recommendation for behavioral training, such as bladder training or pelvic floor exercises, further support this diagnosis. Overflow incontinence typically involves incomplete bladder emptying and is less likely given the normal urinalysis and the nature of the symptoms. Stress incontinence involves leakage with physical activity or exertion, which is not described here. Total incontinence would involve continuous leakage without control, which is not the case here. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is urge incontinence.",9
4731,"The symptoms and findings in this newborn are indicative of Hirschsprung disease, which is characterized by a lack of ganglion cells in the distal colon due to a failure of neural crest cell migration. This results in a lack of innervation in the submucosal (Meissner) and myenteric (Auerbach) plexuses, which are located in the submucosa and muscularis externa, respectively. The absence of these ganglion cells leads to a functional obstruction and the clinical presentation of abdominal distention, failure to pass meconium, and explosive passage of stool upon rectal examination.",10
4736,"The patient presents with dark urine and mild flank pain following an upper respiratory infection. The laboratory findings show anemia (hemoglobin 10.4 g/dL) and significant hematuria (3+ blood in urine) without leukocyte esterase, indicating the absence of infection. The presence of proteinuria (1+) suggests a glomerular process. The normal creatinine level and absence of costovertebral angle tenderness make acute kidney injury or pyelonephritis less likely. The combination of recent upper respiratory symptoms and hematuria suggests a post-infectious glomerulonephritis, which is a type of renal glomerular damage. This is consistent with the patient's symptoms and lab findings.",9
4738,"The patient presents with a classic triad of symptoms: cognitive dysfunction (confusion and forgetfulness), gait disturbance (broad-based gait with short steps), and urinary incontinence. These symptoms are characteristic of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). NPH is a condition where there is an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid causing ventricular enlargement without an increase in intracranial pressure. The gradual onset of symptoms over 4 months and the presence of the triad strongly suggest NPH. Pseudodementia is associated with depression and would not typically present with gait disturbance or incontinence. Frontotemporal dementia usually presents with personality changes and language difficulties rather than gait disturbance and incontinence. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a rapidly progressive dementia with myoclonus and other neurological signs, which does not fit this patient's presentation.",9
4744,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest a metabolic disorder. The key findings are hypoglycemia (glucose: 30 mg/dL), low ketones in urine, and lethargy. The presence of hypoglycemia with low ketones suggests a defect in fatty acid oxidation, as ketones are typically produced when glucose is low and fatty acids are being metabolized for energy. Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency is a disorder of fatty acid oxidation that presents with hypoketotic hypoglycemia, especially during fasting or illness. The other options are lysosomal storage disorders (A and B) or a carbohydrate metabolism disorder (D), which do not typically present with this specific combination of hypoglycemia and low ketones.",9
4697,,0
4746,"The patient presents with tender, purple discolorations on the skin, which are indicative of skin necrosis. He started a new medication 4 days ago after failed cardioversion for atrial fibrillation, suggesting he was likely started on warfarin. Warfarin can cause skin necrosis, particularly in patients with protein C deficiency. Warfarin initially reduces levels of protein C faster than other clotting factors, leading to a transient hypercoagulable state and potential skin necrosis. This is consistent with the timeline and presentation of the patient's symptoms.",9
4751,"The infant presents with hyperammonemia, low citrulline, and increased orotic acid, which are indicative of a urea cycle disorder. The urea cycle is responsible for converting ammonia to urea for excretion. A deficiency in the enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) leads to an accumulation of carbamoyl phosphate, which is then converted to orotic acid, causing orotic aciduria. Low citrulline levels suggest a block before citrulline is formed, which is consistent with OTC deficiency. The other enzyme deficiencies listed do not match the biochemical findings: branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase deficiency is associated with maple syrup urine disease, cystathionine synthase deficiency with homocystinuria, and homogentisic acid dioxygenase deficiency with alkaptonuria. Therefore, the enzyme most likely deficient in this patient is ornithine transcarbamylase.",9
4755,"The patient is experiencing symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including nightmares and difficulty sleeping. He has been started on sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), which is a first-line treatment for PTSD. However, he continues to have persistent nightmares. Prazosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist that has been shown to be effective in reducing nightmares associated with PTSD. It is often used as an adjunctive treatment in such cases. Diazepam and triazolam are benzodiazepines, which are not recommended for PTSD due to the risk of dependency and lack of efficacy in treating core PTSD symptoms. Phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and is not typically used for PTSD, especially not for nightmares. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management for this patient is to add prazosin to address his persistent nightmares.",9
4753,"The patient is presenting with symptoms suggestive of schizophrenia, given the presence of delusions, disorganized behavior, and negative symptoms such as social withdrawal and poverty of speech. In schizophrenia, certain factors are associated with a more favorable prognosis. These include acute onset of symptoms, good premorbid functioning, later age of onset, female gender, and presence of mood symptoms. In this case, the acute onset of symptoms is a favorable prognostic factor, as it suggests a more sudden change in behavior and functioning, which is often associated with a better response to treatment and a more favorable outcome.",9
4766,"The loading dose of a drug is calculated to quickly achieve the desired plasma concentration. The formula for the loading dose is: \( \text{Loading Dose} = \text{Target Plasma Concentration} \times \text{Volume of Distribution} \). This formula shows that the volume of distribution is the key factor in determining the loading dose, as it reflects how extensively the drug is distributed throughout the body. The clearance and half-life are more relevant for maintenance dosing, while the therapeutic index is related to safety and efficacy, not directly to dosing calculations.",9
4759,"The patient's history and chest x-ray findings are suggestive of silicosis, a type of pneumoconiosis caused by inhalation of silica dust, commonly seen in occupations like glass manufacturing. The x-ray findings of calcified hilar lymph nodes (""eggshell calcification"") and nodules in the upper lung fields are characteristic of silicosis. Silicosis is known to increase the risk of pulmonary tuberculosis due to impaired macrophage function. The other options are less likely: malignant mesothelioma is associated with asbestos exposure, invasive aspergillosis is more common in immunocompromised individuals, and Pneumocystis pneumonia is typically seen in patients with significant immunosuppression, such as those with HIV/AIDS.",9
4764,"The clinical scenario describes a classic case of anaphylaxis due to a peanut allergy. Anaphylaxis is a type I hypersensitivity reaction, which is mediated by IgE antibodies. Upon exposure to the allergen (peanut proteins in this case), IgE antibodies on the surface of mast cells and basophils bind to the allergen, leading to degranulation of these cells. This degranulation results in the release of various mediators, including histamine, which causes vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and smooth muscle contraction, leading to symptoms such as hypotension, stridor, and rash. IL-4 is involved in the class switching of B cells to produce IgE, which is central to the development of type I hypersensitivity reactions. Therefore, the most likely mechanism of this pathology is the release of IL-4, which facilitates the production of IgE antibodies.",9
4774,"The patient exhibits a pattern of intense and unstable emotions towards her boyfriend, oscillating between love and hate. This is characteristic of the defense mechanism known as splitting, where an individual is unable to integrate positive and negative aspects of themselves or others, leading to viewing people as all good or all bad. Her emotional emptiness and intense reaction to a perceived slight further support this diagnosis. Repression involves unconsciously blocking unpleasant emotions, thoughts, or memories, which is not evident here. Suppression is the conscious decision to delay paying attention to an emotion or need, which is also not applicable. Regression involves reverting to an earlier stage of development in response to stress, which is not the primary mechanism in this scenario.",9
4769,"The patient is exhibiting symptoms consistent with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), characterized by intrusive thoughts (obsessions) about his dorm room burning down and repetitive checking behaviors (compulsions). OCD is known to be associated with Tourette syndrome, as both conditions can involve repetitive behaviors and have some overlap in their pathophysiology. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is different from OCD and involves a preoccupation with orderliness and control without the presence of true obsessions and compulsions. Schizophrenia involves psychosis, which is not present here. Therefore, the psychiatric disorder most associated with this patient's condition is Tourette syndrome.",9
4773,"The patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder, including depressed mood, anhedonia, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. She has also attempted suicide, indicating a severe level of depression. In cases of severe depression with suicidal ideation or attempts, rapid intervention is crucial. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is often considered the best treatment for severe depression, especially when there is a high risk of suicide, because it can provide rapid relief of symptoms. Antidepressants like paroxetine, phenelzine, and bupropion take several weeks to become effective and are not suitable for immediate relief in acute situations like this.",9
4791,"The patient's symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, muscle aches, and fever, which are consistent with a viral gastroenteritis. The recent travel on a cruise ship is a significant clue, as norovirus is known to cause outbreaks in such settings. The absence of bloody diarrhea and negative stool examination for ova or parasites further supports a viral etiology rather than a parasitic or bacterial one. Giardiasis typically presents with more chronic symptoms and is less associated with fever. C. difficile colitis usually occurs after antibiotic use and presents with more severe symptoms, including bloody diarrhea. Irritable bowel syndrome does not typically present with fever or acute symptoms following travel. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is norovirus infection.",9
4784,"The patient presents with diffuse weakness and an anterior mediastinal mass. The most common causes of an anterior mediastinal mass include thymoma, teratoma, thyroid lesions, and lymphoma. Given the diffuse weakness, thymoma is a likely consideration, as it is often associated with myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is characterized by the presence of acetylcholine receptor antibodies, which cause muscle weakness. The absence of lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms like fever, night sweats, and weight loss makes lymphoma less likely. Elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein is associated with germ cell tumors, and increased urinary catecholamines are associated with pheochromocytoma, neither of which typically present with diffuse weakness as the primary symptom. Therefore, the most likely finding in further evaluation is the presence of acetylcholine receptor antibodies.",9
4789,"The patient's presentation and biopsy findings are suggestive of follicular lymphoma, a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The key cytogenetic finding is the t(14;18) translocation, which is characteristic of this condition. This translocation results in the overexpression of the BCL-2 protein. BCL-2 is an anti-apoptotic protein, meaning it inhibits apoptosis, allowing cells to survive longer than they should, contributing to the development of lymphoma. Therefore, the protein most likely responsible for the patient's condition inhibits apoptosis.",10
4792,"The patient's symptoms and positive urinary metanephrines and catechols suggest a pheochromocytoma, a catecholamine-secreting tumor. In such cases, alpha-adrenergic blockade is the first-line treatment to control hypertension and prevent complications. Phenoxybenzamine, an alpha-blocker, is appropriate for this. Beta-blockers like propranolol should not be used first because they can lead to unopposed alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation, worsening hypertension. Labetalol, although a combined alpha and beta-blocker, is not preferred initially. Nitroprusside can be used for acute blood pressure control. Therefore, propranolol is contraindicated as a first-line therapy.",9
4793,"The clinical presentation of the boy suggests achondroplasia, which is characterized by short stature, disproportionately short limbs, and characteristic facial features such as midface retrusion and a prominent forehead. Achondroplasia is caused by a mutation in the FGFR3 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In autosomal dominant conditions like achondroplasia, complete penetrance is often observed, meaning that individuals who inherit the mutation will express the phenotype. The other options do not fit the scenario: anticipation involves worsening of a genetic disorder in successive generations, imprinting involves differential expression of a gene depending on the parent of origin, and codominance involves both alleles being expressed equally in the phenotype. Therefore, the genetic phenomenon that best explains this condition is complete penetrance.",9
4795,"The patient has a BIRADS-3 finding on her mammogram, which indicates that the finding is probably benign, with a less than 2% chance of malignancy. The standard management for a BIRADS-3 result is to perform a short-term follow-up mammogram to monitor the finding for any changes. This typically involves a follow-up mammogram in 6 months to ensure stability or resolution of the finding. A follow-up in 1 year would be appropriate for a BIRADS-1 or BIRADS-2 finding, which are negative or benign, respectively. A biopsy or treatment would be considered if the finding was suspicious or highly suggestive of malignancy (BIRADS-4 or BIRADS-5). Therefore, the next best step is a follow-up mammogram in 6 months.",9
4796,"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are key to determining the diagnosis. She has a visible and palpable groin protrusion above the inguinal ligament on the right side, which becomes more pronounced during the Valsalva maneuver. This suggests a hernia, as hernias typically become more prominent with increased intra-abdominal pressure. 

A lipoma would not typically change in size with the Valsalva maneuver. Inguinal lymphadenopathy would present as enlarged lymph nodes, which are usually not affected by the Valsalva maneuver. A strangulated hernia would present with more acute symptoms, such as severe pain, nausea, vomiting, and possibly fever, none of which are present in this case.

The location of the protrusion above the inguinal ligament and the fact that it bulges with Valsalva maneuver are characteristic of an indirect inguinal hernia, which is the most common type of hernia in women and men.",9
4800,"The clinical presentation of the 3-year-old boy suggests a common viral upper respiratory infection, characterized by symptoms such as a runny nose, mild cough, and sore throat. These symptoms are typical of infections caused by rhinoviruses, which are the most common cause of the common cold in children. Rhinoviruses belong to the Picornaviridae family and are characterized by their single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. Other viruses that can cause similar symptoms include coronaviruses and enteroviruses, which also have single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genomes. Therefore, the nucleic acid structure that most accurately describes the virus responsible for this boy's condition is single-stranded, positive-sense RNA.",9
4805,"The clinical presentation of this 2-year-old boy suggests lead poisoning. Key indicators include behavioral problems, developmental delays, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, and microcytic anemia (low MCV). The pale conjunctivae and gingival hyperpigmentation (Burton's lines) are also classic signs of lead poisoning. The family’s recent emigration from Bangladesh, where lead exposure might be more common, supports this suspicion. The appropriate treatment for lead poisoning in children with moderate to severe symptoms is chelation therapy. Succimer is used for moderate lead poisoning, and calcium disodium edetate is used for more severe cases. Therefore, the patient would benefit from administration of succimer and calcium disodium edetate.",9
4806,"The patient is presenting with symptoms suggestive of an acute ischemic stroke, given the sudden onset of slurred speech and unilateral weakness. The non-contrast CT of the head shows no evidence of intracranial bleeding, which is important to rule out hemorrhagic stroke before considering thrombolytic therapy. The standard treatment for acute ischemic stroke within a 3 to 4.5-hour window is intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). However, there are contraindications to administering tPA, one of which is uncontrolled hypertension. The patient's blood pressure is 200/105 mm Hg, which is above the recommended threshold for safe administration of tPA. The guidelines suggest that blood pressure should be below 185/110 mm Hg before starting tPA to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic transformation. Therefore, the elevated systolic blood pressure is the contraindication in this scenario.",10
4802,"The patient presents with hematuria (red urine), headaches, and blurry vision. He also has a history of smoking, which is a risk factor for certain cancers. The urinalysis shows significant hematuria (RBC 40-45/hpf) without RBC casts, which suggests a non-glomerular source of bleeding. The absence of proteinuria and RBC casts makes glomerular causes less likely. The flushed face and hypertension could be related to increased erythropoietin production, which is associated with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). RCC can cause paraneoplastic syndromes, including polycythemia due to ectopic erythropoietin production, leading to symptoms like headaches and blurry vision. The patient's smoking history and the presentation are consistent with RCC. Nephrolithiasis typically presents with flank pain and may not cause systemic symptoms like headaches and blurry vision. Transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder would not typically cause systemic symptoms like headaches and blurry vision. Renal oncocytoma is a benign tumor and less likely to cause these systemic symptoms. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is renal cell carcinoma.",9
4812,"The patient's history and presentation suggest a cognitive decline that is not consistent with normal aging. Alzheimer's dementia typically presents with a gradual decline in memory and cognitive function, but this patient's symptoms seem to have a more stepwise progression, particularly after a series of falls. Lewy body dementia often includes visual hallucinations and Parkinsonian symptoms, which are not mentioned here. Vascular dementia is characterized by a stepwise decline in cognitive function due to cerebrovascular events, which aligns with the patient's history of sudden decline after falls and his cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and history of myocardial infarction. The presence of gait instability and bruising could also suggest cerebrovascular issues contributing to his cognitive decline.",9
4813,"The patient presents with hypertension and occasional headaches. Her lab results show normal sodium, chloride, and potassium levels, but a slightly elevated bicarbonate level, which suggests metabolic alkalosis. She has a history of hypertension and is currently on hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic that can cause hypokalemia, but her potassium is normal. Importantly, she has elevated aldosterone and low renin levels, which is a key finding. This combination is indicative of primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome), where the adrenal glands produce too much aldosterone, leading to hypertension and metabolic alkalosis. The other options are less likely: Cushing syndrome would typically present with additional symptoms like weight gain and glucose intolerance; renal artery stenosis would cause secondary hyperaldosteronism with high renin; pheochromocytoma would present with episodic hypertension, palpitations, and sweating.",9
4822,"The patient is exhibiting signs of acute delirium, likely due to the stress of hospitalization, pain, or possible medication effects. In such cases, the immediate priority is to ensure the safety of the patient and staff. Administering an antipsychotic can help manage the acute agitation and confusion, allowing for further evaluation and treatment. Repairing the hip or changing medications are not immediate solutions for the acute delirium. Restraining the patient is not ideal as it can worsen delirium and should be a last resort.",9
4823,"The patient's family history and her young age at diagnosis suggest a hereditary breast cancer syndrome, most likely related to BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. These genes are involved in the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks. Mutations in these genes impair the cell's ability to repair DNA damage, leading to genomic instability and increased risk of cancer development, particularly breast and ovarian cancer.",9
4799,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are indicative of emphysema, a form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The increased anteroposterior chest diameter, diminished breath sounds, flattened diaphragm, and hyperlucency on chest x-ray are classic signs of emphysema. Emphysema is associated with smoking history, and while this patient has a relatively mild smoking history, it is significant enough to contribute to his condition. Patients with emphysema are at increased risk for respiratory infections and pneumothorax due to the damage to lung tissue. However, among the options given, none directly relate to these risks. Instead, we consider other conditions associated with emphysema. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic condition that can lead to early-onset emphysema and also predisposes to liver disease, specifically cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma due to the accumulation of abnormal protein in the liver. Thus, the condition that this patient is at greatest risk for, considering the context of emphysema, is hepatocellular carcinoma.",9
4830,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of bacterial meningitis, including fever, neck stiffness, and a rash. The CSF analysis shows cloudy appearance, elevated opening pressure, high WBC count with a predominance of neutrophils (PMNs), low glucose, and elevated protein, which are consistent with bacterial meningitis. The Gram stain reveals gram-negative diplococci, which is characteristic of Neisseria meningitidis. The appropriate treatment for meningococcal meningitis is ceftriaxone, a broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic effective against Neisseria meningitidis.",9
4831,"The clinical presentation and imaging findings are key to diagnosing this case. The patient experienced a seizure, which can be caused by a mass effect in the brain. The noncontrast CT shows a slightly hyperdense mass, and the MRI reveals a homogeneous, well-circumscribed mass with a hyperintense rim on T2-weighted imaging. These findings are characteristic of a meningioma. Meningiomas are extra-axial tumors that often appear hyperdense on CT due to calcification and are well-circumscribed on MRI. They can cause seizures due to compression of adjacent brain tissue. Glioblastoma multiforme typically appears as an irregular, infiltrative mass with necrosis and heterogeneous enhancement. Schwannomas are usually associated with cranial nerves, particularly the vestibular nerve, and would not typically present with these imaging characteristics. Hemangioblastomas are often associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease and are more common in the posterior fossa, presenting with cystic components and a mural nodule, which is not described here.",9
4832,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a cholestatic liver disease. The presence of jaundice, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and positive antimitochondrial antibodies are indicative of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). PBC is characterized by the autoimmune destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts, leading to cholestasis. The association with anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies also suggests an autoimmune process, which is common in PBC. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is the destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts.",9
4847,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of hemolytic anemia, as indicated by low hemoglobin, low haptoglobin, elevated bilirubin, and negative Coombs test. The presence of a systolic murmur and echocardiographic findings of aortic stenosis (high aortic jet velocity and pressure gradient) suggest mechanical hemolysis due to turbulent blood flow across the stenotic valve. This condition is known as prosthetic valve hemolysis or mechanical hemolysis due to aortic stenosis. The most appropriate management to address the underlying cause of the hemolysis is to relieve the obstruction, which in this case is achieved by aortic valve replacement.",9
4839,"The question describes the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) into the cytosol of muscle fibers, which is a key step in muscle contraction. This process is mediated by the ryanodine receptor, a type of calcium channel that releases calcium from the SR in response to an action potential. This is an example of facilitated diffusion, where ions move down their concentration gradient through a channel.

Let's analyze the options:

A. Reabsorption of glucose by renal tubular cells - This involves secondary active transport via sodium-glucose transport proteins (SGLT), which is not similar to the passive release of calcium from the SR.

B. Secretion of doxorubicin from dysplastic colonic cells - This likely involves active transport mechanisms, such as P-glycoprotein, which is not similar to the passive release of calcium.

C. Uptake of fructose by small intestinal enterocytes - This occurs via facilitated diffusion through GLUT5 transporters, which is similar to the passive release of calcium from the SR.

D. Absorption of LDL-cholesterol by hepatocytes - This involves receptor-mediated endocytosis, which is not similar to the passive release of calcium.

The process that most closely resembles the facilitated diffusion of calcium from the SR is the uptake of fructose by small intestinal enterocytes, as both involve facilitated diffusion through specific transport proteins.",9
4841,"The patient presents with symptoms of pneumonia, and the sputum culture shows colonies with a narrow zone of green hemolysis on blood agar. This description is characteristic of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is known for its alpha-hemolytic activity (green hemolysis) on blood agar. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of pneumonia, especially in individuals with HIV, even if their CD4 count is relatively normal, as in this case.

The key virulence factor of Streptococcus pneumoniae is its polysaccharide capsule, which helps the bacteria evade phagocytosis by the host's immune system. This capsule is crucial for its pathogenicity and is the basis for the pneumococcal vaccines.

The other options are associated with different bacteria:
- M protein is a virulence factor of Streptococcus pyogenes.
- Type III secretion system is used by some Gram-negative bacteria like Salmonella and Shigella.
- Protein A is a virulence factor of Staphylococcus aureus.

Therefore, the most likely causal pathogen, Streptococcus pneumoniae, produces a polysaccharide capsule as its virulence factor.",9
4853,"The patient's presentation is consistent with a Bartholin duct cyst. The location of the mass at the 8 o'clock position on the right side of the vulva is typical for a Bartholin gland, which is located bilaterally at the posterior part of the vaginal opening. The mass is described as soft, non-tender, and mobile, which aligns with the characteristics of a cyst. The symptoms of swelling, occasional itching, and dull ache are also consistent with a Bartholin duct cyst. Condylomata acuminata would present as warty lesions, a vulvar hematoma would typically be tender and associated with trauma, and squamous cell carcinoma would likely present as a more irregular, possibly ulcerated lesion with different characteristics.",9
4852,"The patient's symptoms and the genetic analysis suggest an infection with a virus that has a mutation in the gene encoding viral phosphotransferases. This is characteristic of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, especially in immunocompromised patients like those with HIV. The mutation in the phosphotransferase gene (UL97) of CMV leads to resistance to ganciclovir, which requires phosphorylation by this enzyme to become active. Cidofovir, however, does not require activation by viral kinases and is effective against CMV strains with this mutation. Therefore, cidofovir is the most appropriate treatment for this patient.",9
4834,"The newborn presents with fever, irritability, lethargy, jaundice, respiratory distress, and laboratory findings of leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and hypoglycemia. The mother had a recent episode of genital vesicles, suggesting a herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, but HSV is not listed as an option. The clinical presentation is consistent with neonatal sepsis. The mother's lack of prenatal care and the home delivery increase the risk of infection. The organism most commonly associated with early-onset neonatal sepsis, especially in the context of a home birth and lack of prenatal care, is Group B Streptococcus (GBS), also known as Streptococcus agalactiae. This organism can be transmitted from the mother to the newborn during delivery, particularly if the mother is colonized and there was no intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis.",9
4849,"The patient is experiencing bilateral pitting edema, likely as a side effect of amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker (CCB). CCBs, particularly dihydropyridines like amlodipine, can cause peripheral edema due to preferential dilation of precapillary vessels, leading to increased capillary hydrostatic pressure and fluid leakage into the interstitial space. Adding an ACE inhibitor like enalapril can mitigate this effect by causing postcapillary venodilation, which reduces capillary hydrostatic pressure and thus the risk of edema. Furosemide, a diuretic, is not typically used to counteract CCB-induced edema as it does not address the underlying mechanism. Compression stockings might help with symptoms but do not address the cause. Switching to another dihydropyridine CCB like nifedipine would not reduce the risk of edema, as it has a similar side effect profile to amlodipine.",9
4854,"When delivering bad news to a patient, it is important to do so in a sensitive and compassionate manner. This typically involves setting aside an appropriate amount of time to discuss the news in person, ensuring privacy, and allowing the patient to process the information and ask questions. Option A is the most appropriate choice as it emphasizes the importance of dedicating time and ensuring no interruptions, which aligns with best practices for delivering bad news. Options B, C, and D are inappropriate as they either delegate the responsibility, lack personal interaction, or do not provide the necessary support for the patient.",9
4860,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS), which is often associated with small-cell lung cancer. The key features include proximal muscle weakness that improves with exercise, autonomic symptoms (such as dry mouth), and absent reflexes. These symptoms are due to autoantibodies against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels, which impair acetylcholine release from nerve terminals. This mechanism aligns with option B.",9
4871,"The clinical presentation of bilious vomiting, failure to pass stool, and abdominal distension in a newborn suggests a bowel obstruction. The x-ray findings of dilated small bowel loops, microcolon, and a mixture of gas and meconium in the right lower quadrant are indicative of meconium ileus, which is often associated with cystic fibrosis. In cases of meconium ileus, the initial management step is to attempt to relieve the obstruction with a contrast enema, specifically a Gastrografin enema, which can help break down the inspissated meconium and relieve the obstruction. Exploratory laparotomy is considered if the enema is unsuccessful. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is a Gastrografin enema.",9
4872,"The patient presents with symptoms and lab findings suggestive of adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, weight loss, nausea, hypotension, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and low morning cortisol. The low cortisol level is particularly indicative of adrenal insufficiency. To confirm primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease), the next step is to perform an ACTH stimulation test using cosyntropin. This test will help determine if the adrenal glands can produce cortisol in response to ACTH stimulation. If cortisol levels do not rise appropriately after cosyntropin administration, it confirms primary adrenal insufficiency.",9
4874,"The patient is likely started on digoxin for rate control in atrial fibrillation. Digoxin toxicity is associated with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, confusion, blurry yellow vision, and arrhythmias. Hypokalemia increases the risk of digoxin toxicity because digoxin competes with potassium for binding at the Na+/K+ ATPase pump. Low potassium levels enhance digoxin's effects, increasing the risk of toxicity.",9
4876,"The patient's symptoms are suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), characterized by malaise, hair loss, a photosensitive rash, arthralgia, and fever. In SLE, the most commonly seen laboratory finding is the presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA), which are positive in nearly all patients with SLE, although they are not specific to the disease. Anti-smith antibodies are more specific but less commonly seen. Anti-histone antibodies are associated with drug-induced lupus, and anti-Ro antibodies are associated with Sjögren's syndrome and subacute cutaneous lupus. Therefore, the most common lab finding in SLE is a positive ANA.",9
4881,"The patient's presentation is consistent with an acute gout attack, characterized by intense joint pain, erythema, warmth, and swelling, often triggered by alcohol and red meat consumption. The synovial fluid analysis showing neutrophils and the presence of negatively birefringent needle-shaped crystals under polarized light microscopy confirms the diagnosis of gout. The best initial treatment for an acute gout attack is to reduce inflammation and pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the first-line treatment for acute gout attacks. Uricosuric drugs and xanthine oxidase inhibitors are used for long-term management to lower uric acid levels but are not appropriate for acute attacks. Intra-articular steroid injections can be used if NSAIDs are contraindicated or ineffective, but NSAIDs are typically the first choice.",9
4883,"In cases of acetaminophen overdose, the first step is to prevent further absorption of the drug. Activated charcoal is effective if administered within 1-2 hours of ingestion. Since the patient ingested the acetaminophen one hour ago, activated charcoal should be given immediately. Additionally, a serum acetaminophen level should be drawn to assess the risk of hepatotoxicity. However, the level is most accurate when drawn at least 4 hours post-ingestion. Therefore, the most appropriate step is to give activated charcoal now and plan to draw the serum acetaminophen level in three hours, which would be four hours post-ingestion.",9
4882,"The infant presents with lethargy, irritability, and retinal hemorrhages. These symptoms, along with the history of missed appointments, raise suspicion for non-accidental trauma, specifically shaken baby syndrome. Retinal hemorrhages are a classic finding in this condition. To assess for potential intracranial injury, which is common in shaken baby syndrome, a noncontrast CT of the head is the most appropriate investigation. This imaging can reveal subdural hematomas or other brain injuries that are critical for diagnosis and management.",9
4879,"The patient's symptoms and history are suggestive of a disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI). She presents with migratory polyarthralgia (right wrist pain followed by right knee pain), fever, and characteristic skin lesions. The vesiculopustular lesions are typical of DGI. Her sexual activity and use of oral contraceptives are relevant as they increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections, including gonorrhea. The recent travel to Connecticut is less relevant here, as it might suggest Lyme disease, but the presence of vesiculopustular lesions and migratory arthritis aligns more with DGI. Reactive arthritis and acute rheumatic fever are less likely given the skin findings and sexual history. Staphylococcus aureus arthritis typically presents with a single joint involvement and lacks the characteristic skin lesions seen here.",9
4885,"Sensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those with the disease (true positive rate). It is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives. In this study, there are 500 patients with colon cancer, and 450 of them test positive for the serum marker. Therefore, the true positives (TP) are 450, and the false negatives (FN) are 50 (since 500 - 450 = 50). The sensitivity is calculated as TP / (TP + FN) = 450 / (450 + 50).",10
4894,"The patient's symptoms and history are suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS). She presents with monocular blindness, which could be due to optic neuritis, a common initial presentation of MS. The episodes of weakness and urinary incontinence that resolve on their own are consistent with the relapsing-remitting nature of MS. Pain with eye movement and nystagmus further support this diagnosis. In MS, a lumbar puncture typically reveals the presence of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which are indicative of intrathecal IgG production. This is a classic finding in MS and helps differentiate it from other conditions.",9
4893,"The patient is a 14-year-old boy with bilateral swelling of the tibial tuberosities and soreness, especially during physical activities like running or squatting. This presentation is characteristic of Osgood-Schlatter disease, which is caused by repetitive stress or overuse of the quadriceps muscle leading to traction apophysitis at the tibial tuberosity. This condition is common in adolescents who are active in sports. The other options do not fit the clinical picture: Osteopetrosis is a bone disorder characterized by increased bone density, Paget disease involves abnormal bone remodeling, and Ewing sarcoma is a malignant bone tumor, none of which match the symptoms described.",9
4904,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a chronic subdural hematoma. The key points are the progressive disorientation, left-sided weakness, and history of a fall 4 months ago. Chronic subdural hematomas often occur in older adults after minor head trauma, especially in those with brain atrophy or alcohol use, which can stretch the bridging veins. The CT scan would likely show a crescent-shaped hematoma. The tearing of bridging veins is the typical cause of a subdural hematoma, particularly in this context of delayed symptom onset after trauma.",9
4900,"The patient presents with signs and symptoms suggestive of acute cholangitis, which is characterized by fever, jaundice, and abdominal pain. The laboratory findings show elevated direct bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, indicating an obstructive jaundice likely due to a biliary obstruction. The presence of fever and hypotension suggests sepsis, likely from a biliary source. In this scenario, the best next step in management is to relieve the biliary obstruction. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the procedure of choice for both diagnosis and therapeutic intervention in acute cholangitis, as it allows for decompression of the biliary system by removing the obstruction, typically a gallstone. This is crucial in managing the infection and preventing further complications.",9
4910,"The patient has sustained a head-first diving injury, which is highly suggestive of a cervical spine injury, especially given the step-off noted on examination. He is unconscious with a low respiratory rate (8/min), indicating potential respiratory compromise. In such cases, securing the airway is a priority to prevent hypoxia and further neurological damage. Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is the most appropriate next step to secure the airway in a controlled manner, especially given the patient's altered mental status and potential for cervical spine injury. Imaging studies and further assessments can be done after the airway is secured.",9
4907,"The patient presents with bloody diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, which are suggestive of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). The history of consuming undercooked meats, particularly beef, and the recent camping trip where he drank stream water, raises suspicion for an infectious cause. The laboratory findings of low haptoglobin and elevated LDH indicate hemolysis. Among the options, Escherichia coli, specifically the enterohemorrhagic strain (E. coli O157:H7), is known to cause HUS following ingestion of undercooked beef. Campylobacter jejuni can cause bloody diarrhea but is less commonly associated with HUS. Colon cancer is unlikely given the acute presentation and the patient's young age. Giardia lamblia typically causes non-bloody diarrhea. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's presentation is E. coli.",9
4926,"The patient's symptoms and test results suggest an obstructive lung disease. The key findings include a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio, decreased FEV1, and increased total lung capacity, which are characteristic of obstructive lung diseases. The decreased DLCO indicates impaired gas exchange, which is often seen in emphysema, a type of COPD. The patient's long smoking history and symptoms of prolonged expiratory phase and wheezing further support the diagnosis of COPD. Bronchiectasis typically presents with recurrent infections and productive cough, which are not mentioned here. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis and interstitial lung disease are restrictive lung diseases, which would show a normal or increased FEV1:FVC ratio and decreased total lung capacity, not increased as seen in this patient.",9
4924,"The symptoms and findings in this case suggest a congenital heart defect. The poor weight gain and cyanosis during feeding and crying indicate a condition causing decreased oxygenation. The harsh systolic murmur over the left upper sternal border is characteristic of a right ventricular outflow obstruction, such as in Tetralogy of Fallot. This condition includes right ventricular outflow obstruction, ventricular septal defect, overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy. The cyanosis occurs due to right-to-left shunting of blood, especially during exertion or crying, when systemic vascular resistance decreases. The chest x-ray might show a boot-shaped heart, typical of Tetralogy of Fallot, due to right ventricular hypertrophy. Therefore, the most likely cause of the symptoms is right ventricular outflow obstruction.",9
4912,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest a diagnosis of Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency (LAD) type 1. This condition is characterized by a defect in the CD18 molecule, which is a component of integrins on leukocytes. Integrins are crucial for the firm adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium during the process of extravasation to sites of infection. The elevated leukocyte count and the presence of infections without pus formation are typical of LAD. The specific defect in LAD type 1 is the inability of leukocytes to adhere to the endothelium, which is necessary for their migration to infection sites. Therefore, the correct statement describing the patient's condition is that the leukocytes fail to adhere to the endothelium during their migration to the site of infection.",9
4931,"The clinical presentation is highly suggestive of testicular torsion, which is a surgical emergency. The key features include sudden onset of severe testicular pain, nausea/vomiting, a swollen and erythematous scrotum, and the absence of the cremasteric reflex (failure of the scrotum to elevate when the inner thigh is stroked). The negative Prehn's sign (pain not relieved by elevation of the scrotum) also supports this diagnosis. Testicular torsion requires immediate surgical intervention to salvage the testis, as delay can lead to testicular necrosis. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is surgical exploration of the scrotum.",10
4930,"Combined oral contraceptives, such as those containing levonorgestrel and ethinylestradiol, primarily prevent pregnancy by inhibiting ovulation. This is achieved through the suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, leading to decreased secretion of gonadotropins. Specifically, the rise in luteinizing hormone (LH) is inhibited, which prevents the LH surge necessary for ovulation. While thickening of cervical mucus and suppression of folliculogenesis are also effects of combined oral contraceptives, the most important mechanism is the inhibition of the LH surge.",9
4937,"The patient is expressing feelings of hopelessness and frustration due to her chronic illness and lack of improvement despite treatment. The most appropriate initial response is to validate her feelings and show empathy. This approach helps build rapport and trust, which is crucial before discussing treatment adherence or other interventions. Option B acknowledges her feelings and validates her experience, which is the most appropriate initial response in this context.",9
4946,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a rapidly progressive neurological condition. The key details include her history of intravenous drug use, which increases the risk of HIV infection, and the MRI findings of multiple white matter lesions. The histological findings of gigantic, deformed astrocytes and oligodendrocytes with abnormal nuclei are characteristic of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a demyelinating disease caused by the JC virus. The JC virus is a double-stranded circular DNA virus that infects oligodendrocytes, leading to demyelination. This condition is common in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS. Therefore, the most likely cause of her neurological symptoms is infection with the JC virus.",9
4940,"The boy presents with photophobia, pruritus, conjunctival injection, watery discharge, and vesicular lesions on the eyelids. These symptoms are suggestive of a viral infection. The presence of vesicles with an erythematous base is characteristic of a herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. HSV can cause herpetic blepharitis, which involves vesicular lesions on the eyelids and conjunctivitis. The history of atopic dermatitis and asthma does not directly relate to the cause but indicates a predisposition to skin conditions. Adenovirus typically causes conjunctivitis with watery discharge but does not cause vesicular lesions. Molluscum contagiosum causes pearly papules, not vesicles. Staphylococcus aureus would cause bacterial conjunctivitis, typically with purulent discharge, not vesicular lesions.",9
4949,"The patient presents with symptoms and findings suggestive of gastric cancer, specifically an ulcerated mass in the stomach with biopsy showing irregular-shaped tubules with intraluminal mucus and debris. This is consistent with adenocarcinoma of the stomach. Known risk factors for gastric cancer include dietary nitrates, which are found in preserved and smoked foods. These nitrates can be converted into carcinogenic nitrosamines in the stomach, increasing the risk of gastric cancer. Other options, such as inflammatory bowel disease, low-fiber diet, and blood type O, are not directly associated with gastric cancer. Blood type A, not O, has been associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer. Therefore, the most likely predisposing factor in this case is dietary nitrates.",9
4951,"The newborn is presenting with a whitish, non-purulent vaginal discharge and moderate mammary enlargement. These findings are common in newborns due to the influence of maternal hormones, particularly estrogen, which can cross the placenta and affect the infant. This condition is known as ""neonatal estrogen withdrawal"" and is a normal physiological response. The discharge and breast enlargement are benign and typically resolve on their own without intervention. There is no indication of any underlying disorder such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which would present with other symptoms such as ambiguous genitalia or electrolyte imbalances. Therefore, no further tests or interventions are needed at this time.",9
4965,"The clinical presentation of a 4-year-old boy with a swollen, painful knee and a family history of a bleeding disorder in the maternal uncle suggests a possible hereditary bleeding disorder. The bloody synovial fluid from arthrocentesis indicates hemarthrosis, which is common in hemophilia. Hemophilia is an X-linked recessive disorder, often affecting males, and is characterized by a deficiency in clotting factors, leading to prolonged bleeding. The most common types are Hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) and Hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency). Both conditions result in a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) due to the intrinsic pathway defect. The normal platelet count and normal prothrombin time (PT) help differentiate hemophilia from other bleeding disorders. Therefore, further evaluation is most likely to show a prolonged PTT.",9
4954,"The patient's symptoms and lab findings suggest a diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis. The key features include joint pain in the MCP joints, increased thirst and urination (suggestive of diabetes mellitus), hyperpigmentation of the skin, and elevated liver enzymes with right upper quadrant tenderness (suggestive of liver involvement). The elevated serum ferritin indicates iron overload. In hereditary hemochromatosis, there is a deficiency or dysfunction of hepcidin, a hormone that regulates iron absorption. This leads to increased intestinal iron absorption and subsequent iron overload, causing the symptoms observed in this patient.",9
4953,"The patient has a mutation in the COL1A1 gene, which is associated with osteogenesis imperfecta. This condition is characterized by defects in type I collagen, which is a major component of bone, skin, and other connective tissues. The symptoms described, such as multiple fractures, poor dentition, and conductive hearing loss, align with this diagnosis. Type I collagen is also a significant component of the sclera of the eye. In osteogenesis imperfecta, the sclera can become thin, leading to the characteristic blue sclera. Therefore, the impaired formation due to the COL1A1 mutation is most likely associated with the sclera.",9
4963,"The clinical presentation of recurrent skin abscesses caused by Staphylococcus aureus and the NBT test showing an inability to kill microbes suggests a defect in the oxidative burst mechanism of phagocytes. The NBT test is used to assess the ability of neutrophils to produce reactive oxygen species, which are crucial for killing certain bacteria and fungi. A negative NBT test indicates a failure in this process, which is characteristic of Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD). CGD is caused by a defect in the NADPH oxidase complex, leading to an inability to generate the microbicidal respiratory burst. Therefore, the most likely defect responsible for these findings is the inability to generate the microbicidal respiratory burst.",9
4973,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are suggestive of heart failure, likely due to diastolic dysfunction given the presence of an S4 gallop. The S4 gallop indicates a stiff or hypertrophied left ventricle, which is common in patients with long-standing hypertension. The symptoms of orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and lower extremity edema further support this diagnosis. In heart failure, particularly with preserved ejection fraction (diastolic heart failure), there is decreased compliance of the left ventricle, not increased compliance. The body compensates for heart failure by activating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which leads to increased tone of the efferent renal arterioles to maintain glomerular filtration rate despite reduced cardiac output. This compensatory mechanism is a key pathophysiologic change in heart failure.",9
4975,"The procedure described is the acid-fast stain, specifically the Ziehl-Neelsen stain. This method is used to identify acid-fast bacteria, which retain the red color of carbol fuchsin even after being washed with an acid-alcohol solution. The presence of numerous red organisms indicates that the pathogen is acid-fast. Among the options, Nocardia asteroides is a partially acid-fast organism, while Mycobacterium species (not listed here) are fully acid-fast. Rickettsia rickettsii, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Staphylococcus aureus are not acid-fast. Therefore, the most likely isolated pathogen is Nocardia asteroides.",9
4969,"The patient has a history of working in a sandblasting factory, which suggests exposure to silica dust. The chest X-ray finding of calcified hilar lymph nodes with an 'eggshell' appearance is characteristic of silicosis, a type of pneumoconiosis caused by inhalation of silica particles. Silicosis is known to increase the risk of developing tuberculosis (TB) because silica impairs macrophage function, making it easier for Mycobacterium tuberculosis to establish an infection. Therefore, the patient is at increased risk for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.",10
4974,"The patient presents with signs of hyperandrogenism (acne, hirsutism) and irregular menses, which are suggestive of a condition involving excess androgen production. The elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone level is a key laboratory finding that points towards congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). In CAH, the most common enzyme deficiency is 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which leads to an accumulation of 17-hydroxyprogesterone and increased androgen production. This matches the patient's symptoms and lab findings. Other enzyme deficiencies, such as 11-hydroxylase or 17-hydroxylase, would present with different clinical and laboratory profiles. Malignancy is not suggested by the current findings.",9
4990,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest nephrotic syndrome, characterized by proteinuria, edema, and hypoalbuminemia. The kidney biopsy findings of granular appearance on immunofluorescence and subepithelial deposits on electron microscopy are indicative of membranous nephropathy. Membranous nephropathy is often associated with the presence of phospholipase A2 receptor antibodies, which are found in many cases of primary membranous nephropathy. Other options like diabetes, onset in childhood, and sickle cell disease are associated with different types of kidney pathologies, such as diabetic nephropathy, minimal change disease, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, respectively.",9
4980,"The patient's symptoms and findings suggest a hematological disorder, likely chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), given the asymptomatic lymphocytosis noted previously, the presence of lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. The fatigue, weight loss, and bruising could be due to anemia and thrombocytopenia, which are common in CLL. The presence of scleral icterus suggests hemolysis, which can occur in CLL due to autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). AIHA is characterized by the destruction of red blood cells by autoantibodies, and a positive direct Coombs test would confirm the presence of these antibodies. Therefore, the laboratory finding best associated with this condition is a positive direct Coombs test, indicating AIHA.",9
5001,"The patient presents with symptoms and ECG findings suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction (MI), specifically an inferior wall MI given the ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. In the context of diagnosing an MI, cardiac biomarkers are crucial. 

Troponin I is the most specific and sensitive marker for myocardial injury. It begins to rise within 3-4 hours after the onset of chest pain, peaks at 12-24 hours, and can remain elevated for 7-10 days. This makes it particularly useful for both early and late diagnosis of MI.

Creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) is also used to diagnose MI, but it is less specific than troponin I and returns to normal levels more quickly, within 48-72 hours.

Aspartate transaminase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase-1 (LDH-1) are less specific for cardiac injury and are not the primary markers used in current practice for diagnosing MI.

Given the specificity and sensitivity of troponin I for myocardial injury, it is the most significant enzyme for diagnosing this patient’s condition.",9
4985,"The patient presents with acute monoarticular arthritis, fever, and a high white blood cell count in the synovial fluid with a predominance of polymorphonuclear cells. These findings are suggestive of septic arthritis. The patient's history of inconsistent condom use and multiple sexual partners raises the suspicion of a sexually transmitted infection, such as gonorrhea, which can lead to disseminated gonococcal infection and septic arthritis through hematogenous spread. The presence of a painless ulcer on the toe could be unrelated or a sign of diabetic neuropathy, but it does not directly relate to the knee condition. The high WBC count in the synovial fluid and the acute presentation make other options like gout or autoimmune arthritis less likely. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause is the hematogenous spread of infection, likely from a sexually transmitted source.",9
4981,"The patient is likely experiencing alcohol withdrawal, given his history of chronic alcoholism and symptoms of confusion, agitation, sweating, and tachycardia. The recommended treatment for alcohol withdrawal is typically a benzodiazepine, which acts by enhancing the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA at the GABA-A receptor. Benzodiazepines increase the frequency of chloride channel opening events, leading to increased inhibitory effects in the central nervous system, which helps alleviate withdrawal symptoms.",9
5003,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), characterized by widespread epidermal detachment and a positive Nikolsky sign. The history of a similar reaction to an antibiotic supports a drug-induced cause. The next best diagnostic step is to confirm the diagnosis through a skin biopsy and histopathologic analysis, which will show full-thickness epidermal necrosis, a hallmark of TEN. Indirect immunofluorescence is used for autoimmune blistering diseases like pemphigus vulgaris, which is not the primary concern here. Blood cultures are not immediately relevant for diagnosing TEN, and PCR for staphylococcal exfoliative toxin is used for staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, which is less likely given the patient's history and presentation.",9
5004,"The patient's laboratory findings show hypercalcemia (elevated serum calcium), hypophosphatemia (low serum phosphorus), elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, and low urinary calcium excretion. These findings are suggestive of a condition where there is increased PTH but low urinary calcium, which is atypical for primary hyperparathyroidism where urinary calcium is usually high. The combination of high PTH, high serum calcium, and low urinary calcium is characteristic of Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia (FHH). FHH is caused by a defect in the calcium-sensing receptors (CaSR), primarily in the parathyroid glands and kidneys, leading to altered calcium homeostasis. This defect causes the parathyroid glands to perceive normal calcium levels as low, resulting in increased PTH secretion and reduced calcium excretion by the kidneys.",9
5021,"The patient presents with symptoms of dizziness and syncope, which are likely due to orthostatic hypotension and bradycardia. Her medications include bisoprolol (a beta-blocker) and doxazosin (an alpha-blocker), both of which can contribute to hypotension and bradycardia. The ECG shows a prolonged PR interval, indicating first-degree AV block, which can be exacerbated by beta-blockers. The significant drop in blood pressure upon standing and the bradycardia suggest that her antihypertensive medications are contributing to her symptoms. Therefore, the next best step is to stop or adjust her antihypertensive medications to address the orthostatic hypotension and bradycardia.",9
5018,"The patient's symptoms are indicative of Wernicke's aphasia, characterized by fluent speech with paraphasic errors, impaired comprehension, and impaired repetition. The patient also exhibits a lack of awareness of her speech deficits, which is typical of Wernicke's aphasia. Additionally, the right upper quadrant field-cut suggests involvement of the visual pathways, which can occur with lesions in the temporal lobe. Wernicke's aphasia is typically associated with damage to the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant hemisphere (usually the left hemisphere for right-handed individuals).",9
5020,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of herpes zoster ophthalmicus, which is a reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus affecting the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve. The key features include a vesicular rash around the eye and a history of burning and itching. The best initial treatment for herpes zoster is antiviral therapy to reduce viral replication and prevent complications. Acyclovir is an antiviral medication effective against varicella-zoster virus. Oral steroids and topical treatments are not appropriate as the first-line treatment in this scenario.",9
5022,"The question involves selecting a medication that would affect the urinary excretion of amphetamines. Amphetamines are weak bases, and their excretion can be influenced by the pH of the urine. Acidifying the urine increases the excretion of weak bases like amphetamines. Among the options, ascorbic acid is known to acidify the urine. By acidifying the urine, ascorbic acid would increase the excretion of amphetamines, potentially leading to a faster recovery of mental status and changes in urinary pH and specific gravity. Potassium citrate would alkalinize the urine, aluminum hydroxide is an antacid that would not significantly affect urinary pH in the desired direction, and tap water would not have a specific effect on urinary pH. Therefore, ascorbic acid is the most appropriate choice to achieve a statistically significant result favoring the intervention by increasing amphetamine excretion.",9
5025,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a viral infection associated with lymphoproliferative disorders. The key points are the generalized lymphadenopathy, abnormal lymphocytes, hypercalcemia, and the patient's travel history to Japan. Hypercalcemia and abnormal lymphocytes are indicative of a possible lymphoproliferative disorder. Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) is known to be associated with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), which can present with these symptoms. HTLV-1 is endemic in certain regions, including Japan. The patient's promiscuity and lack of barrier protection increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections, including HTLV-1. Therefore, the virus most likely associated with this patient's condition is HTLV-1.",9
5034,"Muscle contraction involves the interaction between actin and myosin filaments, which is regulated by calcium ions. Calcium ions bind to troponin C, a component of the troponin complex on the actin filament. This binding causes a conformational change that moves tropomyosin away from the myosin-binding sites on actin, allowing myosin heads to attach and initiate contraction. If a drug blocks the site where calcium ions bind, it would prevent this conformational change, thereby inhibiting muscle contraction. Therefore, the site of action for this drug is likely troponin C, where calcium ions bind to facilitate contraction.",9
5016,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of nephrotic syndrome, including leg swelling, frothy urine, and significant proteinuria. The urinalysis shows 3+ protein and casts with a cross appearance under polarized light, which is indicative of amyloidosis. Amyloidosis is associated with the deposition of amyloid proteins in organs, and in this case, it is likely affecting the kidneys. The characteristic finding on renal biopsy under polarized light is apple-green birefringence with Congo red staining, typical of amyloid deposits. In the context of this patient, who has a history of rheumatoid arthritis, secondary (AA) amyloidosis is a possibility, but the presence of tingling in fingers and toes and the demographic (African American) also raises the suspicion for multiple myeloma or AL amyloidosis. Multiple myeloma is associated with elevated levels of IL-6, which stimulates plasma cell proliferation and is a key factor in the pathogenesis of the disease. Therefore, the most likely cause of the edema, related to amyloidosis secondary to multiple myeloma, is associated with elevated levels of IL-6.",9
5035,"The patient has a living will that clearly states her refusal of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, intubation, or life support on mechanical ventilation. This document reflects her autonomous wishes regarding end-of-life care. Her son, despite having durable power-of-attorney, is objecting to the discontinuation of life support. However, the living will takes precedence as it directly reflects the patient's own wishes. The role of the power-of-attorney is to make decisions in line with the patient's expressed wishes when they are unable to do so themselves. Therefore, the most appropriate response is to honor the patient's living will and discontinue mechanical ventilation, as it aligns with her documented wishes.",9
5039,"The patient has hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia, which are components of metabolic syndrome. His central obesity and insulin resistance are key features. The accumulation of fat in visceral tissue is closely linked to insulin resistance, which is a major factor in the development of hypertension in obese individuals. Insulin resistance leads to compensatory hyperinsulinemia, which can increase sympathetic nervous system activity and renal sodium retention, contributing to hypertension. While proinflammatory cytokines and dietary salt intake can also play roles, insulin resistance is the most direct and significant factor in this context.",9
5046,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left leg, as indicated by the pain, swelling, and palpable cord in the popliteal fossa. She also has a history of recurrent miscarriages and stiff, swollen finger joints, which could suggest an autoimmune condition. The laboratory findings show a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), which is often associated with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). APS is characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, such as anti-β2 glycoprotein antibodies, and can lead to thrombosis and pregnancy complications. The presence of these antibodies would confirm the diagnosis of APS. Therefore, testing for anti-β2 glycoprotein antibodies is the most appropriate confirmatory test in this scenario.",9
5047,"The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of a perforated peptic ulcer, given the sudden worsening of abdominal pain, epigastric pain radiating to the shoulders, fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and signs of peritonitis (abdominal rigidity and rebound tenderness). The shoulder pain suggests diaphragmatic irritation, likely due to free air under the diaphragm from a perforation. The next best step in management to confirm the diagnosis of a perforated ulcer is to obtain a chest radiograph, which can quickly and effectively show free air under the diaphragm, indicating perforation.",9
5037,"Metformin is generally contraindicated in conditions that increase the risk of lactic acidosis. These include significant renal impairment, severe liver disease, and unstable or acute heart failure. 

- **Hepatitis C infection (A)**: Metformin is typically avoided in significant liver disease due to the risk of lactic acidosis. However, if liver function is stable and there is no significant hepatic impairment, metformin can sometimes be used cautiously.

- **Mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (B)**: Metformin can be used in patients with mild COPD as long as there is no significant hypoxia or risk of lactic acidosis.

- **Recent diagnosis of NYHA Class II congestive heart failure (C)**: Metformin is generally avoided in patients with unstable or acute heart failure due to the risk of lactic acidosis. However, in stable, well-managed heart failure (NYHA Class I or II), metformin can be used cautiously.

- **Headache and family history of brain aneurysms requiring CT angiography (D)**: This scenario does not directly contraindicate metformin use unless there is significant renal impairment from contrast use.

Given these considerations, the most acceptable co-morbidity for continuing metformin is mild COPD, as it does not inherently increase the risk of lactic acidosis.",9
5048,"The patient's symptoms and travel history suggest a possible case of African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, which is endemic in parts of Africa including Nigeria. The painful bite on her forearm could be from a tsetse fly, which transmits the Trypanosoma brucei parasite. The symptoms of fever, lymphadenopathy, and the indurated bite site are consistent with the early stage of this disease. 

Chloroquine and primaquine are used for malaria, which is not consistent with the presentation of lymphadenopathy and the indurated bite. Sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine are used for toxoplasmosis, which does not fit the travel history and symptoms. 

Suramin and melarsoprol are used to treat African trypanosomiasis. Suramin is used for the early hemolymphatic stage, while melarsoprol is used for the later CNS stage. Given the symptoms and recent travel, African trypanosomiasis is the most likely diagnosis, and the treatment would involve suramin and possibly melarsoprol if CNS involvement is suspected later.",9
5050,"The patient is a 32-year-old woman with a 1-cm hard mobile mass in the breast. The mammogram shows calcifications, and the biopsy reveals acinar proliferation with intralobular fibrosis. These findings are characteristic of sclerosing adenosis, which is a benign breast condition. Sclerosing adenosis is known for causing calcifications and can mimic carcinoma on imaging due to its dense fibrous tissue and proliferation of acini. The other options are less likely: Fibroadenoma typically presents as a well-circumscribed, mobile mass without calcifications; infiltrating ductal carcinoma and invasive lobular carcinoma are malignant and would show invasive cancer cells on biopsy, not just acinar proliferation with fibrosis.",9
5056,"The patient has liver cirrhosis, as indicated by the history of alcohol use, abnormal liver enzymes, and physical findings such as telangiectasias and splenomegaly. The ascites is confirmed by ultrasonography and the paracentesis shows a low protein content, which is typical of portal hypertension-related ascites. In cirrhosis, the primary mechanism for ascites formation is increased hydrostatic pressure in the portal venous system due to liver fibrosis, leading to high sinusoidal pressure. This increased pressure causes fluid to leak into the peritoneal cavity, resulting in ascites. The low protein content in the ascitic fluid further supports this mechanism, as it is consistent with transudative fluid due to portal hypertension.",9
5055,"The patient presents with a sudden onset of headache, nausea, loss of consciousness, and nuchal rigidity, which are classic signs of a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The CT scan shows a diffuse hemorrhage at the base of the brain, which is consistent with SAH. The presence of bilateral vitreous hemorrhages (Terson syndrome) further supports this diagnosis. The most common cause of non-traumatic SAH is the rupture of a saccular (berry) aneurysm, especially in a patient with risk factors such as hypertension and smoking. Mycotic aneurysms are less common and typically associated with infectious endocarditis. Intracranial arterial dissection and spinal arteriovenous malformation are less likely to present with these findings. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is a ruptured saccular aneurysm.",9
5059,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are suggestive of a condition affecting the nerves between the metatarsal heads. The burning sensation in the plantar area between the third and fourth metatarsals, radiating to the third and fourth digits, is characteristic of nerve involvement. The fact that pressure applied to the sole of the foot between the metatarsal heads causes pain and an audible click (Mulder's sign) is highly indicative of an intermetatarsal neuroma, also known as Morton's neuroma. This condition is common in individuals who wear high heels, as it can compress the metatarsal heads and irritate the nerve. The other options, such as a stress fracture, osteochondrosis, or osteomyelitis, do not typically present with these specific symptoms and examination findings.",9
5060,"The clinical presentation of recurrent respiratory infections, giardiasis, and hypoplastic tonsils and adenoids suggests a primary immunodeficiency. The key laboratory finding is the decreased levels of cells expressing CD19, CD20, and CD21, which are markers for B cells. This indicates a B cell deficiency. The most common cause of B cell deficiency with these features is X-linked agammaglobulinemia (Bruton's agammaglobulinemia), which is due to a mutation in the gene encoding Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). This mutation leads to a failure in B cell maturation, resulting in low or absent B cells and immunoglobulins, causing the recurrent infections seen in this patient.",9
5070,"The patient presents with acute knee pain, swelling, erythema, and fever, which are concerning for septic arthritis, especially given the recent knee abrasion that could have introduced bacteria. The elevated leukocyte count and ESR further support an inflammatory or infectious process. In cases of suspected septic arthritis, the most appropriate next step is to perform an arthrocentesis to obtain synovial fluid for analysis. This will help confirm the diagnosis by allowing for cell count, Gram stain, culture, and crystal analysis. Blood cultures can also be useful but are not as immediate in confirming septic arthritis as synovial fluid analysis.",9
5062,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), including unilateral leg swelling, erythema, and pitting edema. The history of trauma could be misleading, but the significant swelling and erythema, along with the patient's smoking history and fever, raise suspicion for DVT. The absence of pain on dorsiflexion (negative Homan's sign) does not rule out DVT. The best next step to confirm or rule out DVT is to perform an ultrasound of the right leg, as it is a non-invasive and reliable method for diagnosing DVT.",9
5075,"The patient is a 16-month-old with symptoms consistent with bronchiolitis, likely caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The symptoms include tachypnea, expiratory wheezes, hypoxia, and a history of rhinorrhea, fever, and cough. The standard treatment for bronchiolitis in this age group includes supportive care, such as nasal suctioning to clear secretions, oxygen therapy to address hypoxia, and IV fluids to ensure hydration. Options A, B, and C involve treatments not typically indicated for bronchiolitis. Humidified oxygen and racemic epinephrine (A) are more relevant for croup, while intubation and antibiotics (B and C) are for bacterial infections or severe respiratory distress, which are not indicated here. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment is supportive care with nasal suctioning, oxygen therapy, and IV fluids.",9
5042,"The patient presents with abdominal cramps, fatigue, increased urination, and primary amenorrhea (she hasn't yet had her first menstrual period despite being 16 years old). Additionally, there is a firm mass felt in the lower abdomen. These findings raise suspicion for a possible pregnancy or a mass in the reproductive tract, such as an ovarian cyst or tumor. Given the age and presentation, pregnancy must be considered, especially because urinary symptoms and a palpable mass can be associated with an enlarged uterus. The most appropriate initial step to rule out pregnancy is to perform a serum β-hCG test. Thus, the most appropriate next step is to check a serum β-hCG to either confirm or exclude pregnancy.",9
5077,"The patient is likely prescribed bupropion, which is used for both depression and smoking cessation. Bupropion is contraindicated in patients with a history of seizures or eating disorders, such as bulimia, due to the increased risk of seizures. Therefore, the presence of bulimia would be a contraindication for prescribing bupropion.",9
5072,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with Cushing's disease, which is caused by an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma. The elevated late-night salivary cortisol and high morning plasma ACTH, along with the MRI finding of a pituitary adenoma, support this diagnosis. The optimal treatment for Cushing's disease due to a pituitary adenoma is surgical removal of the adenoma. Transsphenoidal pituitary adenoidectomy is the standard surgical approach for removing pituitary tumors.",9
5083,"The patient presents with a fixed, false belief that her doorman is stealing her packages and entering her apartment, despite evidence to the contrary (security footage showing no one entering her apartment). This belief has persisted for three months. She does not exhibit any other symptoms such as hallucinations, mood changes, or functional impairment, and her family reports no change in behavior or affect. These features are consistent with delusional disorder, which is characterized by the presence of one or more delusions lasting one month or longer without other psychotic symptoms. Adjustment disorder is unlikely as there is no significant stressor or emotional disturbance affecting her functioning. Paranoid personality disorder involves a pervasive distrust and suspicion of others, but it would typically be more generalized and longstanding. Schizotypal personality disorder involves eccentric behavior and thought patterns, which are not described here.",9
5088,"The patient's presentation is consistent with nephrolithiasis, specifically related to a condition known as medullary sponge kidney (MSK). The key findings include the presence of oxalate crystals in the urine, echogenic medullary pyramids, and multiple dense echogenic foci in both kidneys on ultrasound, which are characteristic of MSK. MSK is a developmental anomaly where there is cystic dilatation of the collecting tubules in the renal pyramids. This condition can lead to the formation of kidney stones and recurrent urinary tract infections. The normal serum calcium and elevated uric acid levels, along with the presence of oxalate crystals, support the diagnosis of MSK rather than other conditions like hyperparathyroidism or uric acid stones. The pathogenesis of MSK is not related to dialysis, neoplastic changes, or vascular anomalies, but rather to a developmental anomaly.",9
5089,"The patient's presentation includes a family history of colon and ovarian cancer, as well as a personal history of colon cancer with a mutation in the MSH2 gene. The MSH2 gene is associated with DNA mismatch repair, and mutations in this gene are linked to Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, HNPCC). Lynch syndrome is characterized by an increased risk of colorectal cancer and other cancers, including endometrial and ovarian cancer, often at a younger age. The family history of colon cancer in male relatives and ovarian cancer in the patient's mother aligns with Lynch syndrome. The other options, such as familial adenomatous polyposis, Turcot syndrome, and Gardner syndrome, are associated with different genetic mutations and clinical features.",9
5092,"The patient has signs of liver disease, likely due to chronic alcoholism, as indicated by ascites, engorged paraumbilical veins, and elevated liver enzymes. In the context of diabetes management, pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that can cause fluid retention and exacerbate heart failure. Given the patient's acute heart failure and liver disease, pioglitazone is the most likely medication to have contributed to his presentation.",9
5095,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of Reye's syndrome, which is characterized by acute encephalopathy and liver dysfunction following a viral illness, often associated with aspirin use in children. The history of fever and muscle pain, followed by the administration of an over-the-counter medication (likely aspirin), and the subsequent development of vomiting, somnolence, and hepatomegaly, aligns with this condition. The laboratory findings of elevated liver enzymes further support liver involvement. In Reye's syndrome, the neurologic changes are primarily due to cerebral edema, which results from the encephalopathy. Therefore, the most likely cause of the neurologic changes in this patient is cerebral edema.",9
5103,"The patient is 25 years old and has a family history of colon cancer in her father, who was diagnosed at age 40. This suggests a potential hereditary risk, such as Lynch syndrome, which would warrant earlier screening. Standard guidelines recommend colonoscopy starting at age 40 or 10 years before the earliest diagnosis in the family, whichever comes first, for those with a significant family history. Therefore, a colonoscopy in 5 years, when she turns 30, would be appropriate. Pap smear guidelines recommend starting at age 21 and continuing every 3 years until age 29, without HPV co-testing, which makes options C and D inappropriate for her current age.",9
5110,"In heart failure, the side of the heart that is failing determines the symptoms and signs. Left-sided heart failure typically leads to pulmonary congestion because the left ventricle fails to pump blood effectively, causing blood to back up into the lungs. This results in symptoms such as shortness of breath and pulmonary edema, which can be detected as basilar crackles on auscultation. Right-sided heart failure, on the other hand, leads to systemic venous congestion, resulting in symptoms such as peripheral edema, abdominal fullness, and hepatojugular reflux. Increased ejection fraction is not typically associated with heart failure, as heart failure is usually characterized by reduced ejection fraction. Therefore, basilar crackles on pulmonary auscultation are more indicative of left-sided heart failure.",9
5107,"The patient is experiencing severe vomiting following chemotherapy, which is a common side effect due to the release of serotonin (5-HT) from enterochromaffin cells in the gastrointestinal tract. This serotonin then stimulates 5-HT3 receptors located on vagal afferents, leading to the vomiting reflex. The most effective class of drugs for treating chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) are 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. These drugs work by blocking the 5-HT3 receptors, thereby preventing the emetic signal from being transmitted to the brain. Therefore, the primary mechanism of the drug that would be prescribed in this scenario is 5-HT3 receptor blockade.",10
5115,"The clinical presentation of the child is suggestive of diphtheria, which is caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The key features include fever, sore throat, hoarseness, cervical lymphadenopathy, and the presence of a gray, thick membrane on the tonsils that bleeds when scraped. The child is also acrocyanotic and somnolent, indicating systemic involvement. The family’s recent immigration and the child being on a catch-up vaccination schedule suggest he may not have been vaccinated against diphtheria. 

Corynebacterium diphtheriae produces a toxin that inhibits protein synthesis in host cells. The virulence factor of this bacterium is the diphtheria toxin, which targets and inactivates eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF-2) through ADP-ribosylation. This action halts protein synthesis, leading to cell death and the characteristic pseudomembrane formation.

Therefore, the target of the virulence factor produced by the organism is eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF-2).",9
5113,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of acute appendicitis, including right lower quadrant pain, fever, leukocytosis with a left shift (increased neutrophils and band forms), and guarding. In a young woman, it is important to differentiate appendicitis from gynecological conditions such as ovarian torsion or ectopic pregnancy. While a pelvic exam can provide useful information, imaging is more definitive in this scenario. An ultrasound of the appendix is a non-invasive and effective way to evaluate for appendicitis, especially in young patients. It can help confirm the diagnosis by visualizing an enlarged, non-compressible appendix. Therefore, the next best step is to perform an ultrasound of the appendix.",9
5125,"The patient is experiencing an increase in asthma symptoms, as evidenced by the increased use of albuterol. According to asthma management guidelines, an increase in the use of a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) like albuterol indicates that the patient's asthma is not well-controlled. The next step in management is to introduce a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) to reduce inflammation and improve control. Salmeterol and formoterol are long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) and are not used as monotherapy; they are typically added to an ICS if control is not achieved with an ICS alone. Tiotropium is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and is not a first-line treatment for asthma. Therefore, the appropriate step is to add a daily inhaled corticosteroid, such as fluticasone.",9
5132,"The presentation of multiple skin lesions that developed rapidly and are associated with internal malignancy suggests a paraneoplastic syndrome. The key detail is that the skin lesions are not due to metastases but are associated with an internal malignancy. This is characteristic of Leser-Trélat sign, which is the sudden eruption of multiple seborrheic keratoses and is often associated with internal malignancies, particularly adenocarcinoma of the stomach. The weight loss also supports the possibility of an underlying malignancy. Other options like glioblastoma multiforme, anaplastic astrocytoma, and medullary carcinoma of the thyroid are not typically associated with this skin manifestation.",9
5126,"The patient's symptoms and history are suggestive of ankylosing spondylitis, a type of seronegative spondyloarthropathy. Key features include back pain that is worse in the morning and improves with activity, limited spinal flexion, and hip pain. Ankylosing spondylitis is strongly associated with the HLA-B27 genotype. The presence of celiac disease is not directly related to the diagnosis but does not exclude ankylosing spondylitis. The other options are associated with different conditions: anti-dsDNA antibodies are linked to systemic lupus erythematosus, high levels of creatine phosphokinase are associated with muscle damage, and anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies are linked to Sjögren's syndrome. Therefore, the most likely finding in further evaluation is a positive HLA-B27 genotype.",9
8198,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of multiple myeloma. The key findings include decreased urine output, edema, anemia, renal impairment, hypercalcemia, and lytic bone lesions on X-ray. Multiple myeloma is characterized by the proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow, which can lead to these clinical features. To confirm the diagnosis of multiple myeloma, a bone marrow biopsy is necessary to demonstrate the presence of clonal plasma cells. Other options, such as a peripheral blood smear, parathyroid hormone levels, and a skeletal survey, do not directly confirm the diagnosis of multiple myeloma.",9
8196,"The patient is a 27-year-old African-American woman who is pregnant and presents with microcytic anemia (low MCV and low MCH). Her iron studies show normal ferritin levels, which suggests that iron deficiency anemia is unlikely. Given her ethnicity and the microcytic anemia, thalassemia should be considered. Hemoglobin electrophoresis is the appropriate test to evaluate for thalassemia, as it can identify abnormal hemoglobin variants such as hemoglobin S or hemoglobin C, which are common in African-American populations.",9
8202,"The patient is a 14-year-old girl with short stature and delayed puberty (Tanner stage 2 and no menarche). Her height is at the 3rd percentile, which is significantly below the expected range given her parents' heights. The key here is to determine whether her growth pattern is consistent with her bone age or if there is a delay. An X-ray of the hand and wrist can assess bone age, which helps differentiate between constitutional growth delay and other causes of short stature. If her bone age is delayed, it suggests constitutional growth delay, which is common and often resolves with time. If her bone age is normal, other causes such as endocrine disorders might be considered. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to obtain an X-ray of the hand and wrist to assess bone age.",9
8199,"The clinical presentation and history suggest a parasitic infection, likely acquired during the trip to Indonesia. The symptoms include irritability, diarrhea, weight loss, and a dry cough, along with eosinophilia (20% eosinophils), which is indicative of a helminthic infection. The photomicrograph of a wet stool mount, although not visible here, likely shows a helminth egg or larva. The combination of respiratory symptoms followed by gastrointestinal symptoms and eosinophilia is characteristic of Ascaris lumbricoides infection, a common roundworm. Albendazole is the treatment of choice for Ascaris lumbricoides.",9
8207,"The patient is a 10-year-old boy with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), which increases his risk for certain hematological malignancies, particularly leukemias. The complete blood count shows a very high white blood cell count with a predominance of lymphocytes (94%), severe anemia, and a normal platelet count. The peripheral smear shows immature cells, suggesting a leukemia. The flow cytometry results indicate that the cells are CALLA (CD10) negative. In children, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is common, and it can be of B-cell or T-cell origin. B-cell ALL is usually CD10 positive, whereas T-cell ALL is typically CD10 negative. Given the age, the high lymphocyte count, and the CD10 negative status, precursor T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma is the most likely diagnosis.",9
8204,"In the context of blood flow and oxygen consumption, the femoral artery carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the lower limbs, while the femoral vein carries deoxygenated blood back to the heart. The erythrocytes in the femoral artery will have a higher oxygen content and lower carbon dioxide content compared to those in the femoral vein. 

Chloride shift (or Hamburger shift) occurs in erythrocytes as they exchange bicarbonate ions for chloride ions to maintain electrochemical balance. In the venous blood, where carbon dioxide is higher, more bicarbonate is formed, leading to a higher chloride concentration in the erythrocytes. Therefore, the arterial blood, which has less carbon dioxide, will have a lower chloride concentration in the erythrocytes compared to venous blood.

The ADP/ATP ratio is not directly related to the oxygenation state of the blood in this context. Carbaminohemoglobin forms when carbon dioxide binds to hemoglobin, which is more prevalent in venous blood. Potassium concentration in erythrocytes is not significantly different between arterial and venous blood under normal physiological conditions.

Thus, the hemolysate from the femoral artery would have a lower chloride concentration compared to the femoral vein.",9
8208,"Intracellular transport in neurons involves the movement of materials along the axon, which is facilitated by motor proteins that travel along microtubules. Kinesin is a motor protein that typically moves cargo from the cell body towards the axon terminal (anterograde transport), while dynein moves cargo from the axon terminal back to the cell body (retrograde transport). Troponin is involved in muscle contraction, not intracellular transport. Actin is part of the cytoskeleton but is not directly involved in long-distance axonal transport. Glucose is a molecule used for energy, not a transport protein. Therefore, the proteins essential for intracellular transport in neurons are dynein and kinesin.",9
8210,"MHC class I molecules are crucial for presenting endogenous antigens to cytotoxic T-cells (CD8+ T-cells). When cells, such as tumor cells, have decreased MHC class I expression, they become less recognizable to cytotoxic T-cells, which rely on MHC class I to identify and kill infected or cancerous cells. Natural killer (NK) cells, however, are part of the innate immune system and can recognize and kill cells with low MHC class I expression. This is because NK cells have inhibitory receptors that detect the presence of MHC class I molecules; when these molecules are absent or reduced, the inhibitory signal is lost, allowing NK cells to activate and kill the target cell. Therefore, NK cells are most capable of killing tumor cells with decreased MHC class I expression.",9
8195,"The clinical presentation of this 11-month-old child includes anemia, recurrent infections, macrocephaly, hepatosplenomegaly, and a spontaneous femur fracture. These symptoms are suggestive of a systemic condition rather than an isolated incident of trauma or abuse. The combination of anemia and recurrent infections points towards a hematological disorder, possibly affecting bone marrow function. The spontaneous fracture without a history of trauma suggests bone fragility.

Option A, acidification deficiency, is related to osteopetrosis, which can cause bone fragility due to defective osteoclast function, leading to dense but brittle bones. This condition can also cause anemia and hepatosplenomegaly due to extramedullary hematopoiesis.

Option B, vitamin deficiency, could refer to vitamin D deficiency leading to rickets, but this typically presents with bowing of the legs rather than spontaneous fractures in infants.

Option C, surreptitious child abuse, is less likely given the systemic symptoms and lack of trauma history.

Option D, collagen production deficiency, refers to osteogenesis imperfecta, which causes brittle bones and frequent fractures. However, the presence of anemia and recurrent infections is not typical for osteogenesis imperfecta.

Given the systemic symptoms and the spontaneous fracture, acidification deficiency (osteopetrosis) is the most likely cause.",9
8215,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of malignant hyperthermia, a life-threatening condition triggered by certain anesthetic agents like sevoflurane and nitrous oxide. The key features include increased end-tidal CO2, tachycardia, muscle rigidity, and hyperkalemia. Malignant hyperthermia is caused by a defect in calcium regulation within muscle cells, specifically involving the ryanodine receptor. This receptor, when defective, leads to excessive calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing sustained muscle contraction and increased metabolic activity, which explains the symptoms observed in this patient.",9
8211,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of cold agglutinin disease, which is often associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. The chest x-ray findings of diffuse, patchy infiltrates bilaterally support this diagnosis. The antibiotic used to treat Mycoplasma pneumoniae is typically a macrolide, such as erythromycin or azithromycin, or a tetracycline, such as doxycycline. However, the clue about promoting gut motility points towards erythromycin, which is known to have prokinetic effects on the gastrointestinal tract. Erythromycin acts as a motilin receptor agonist, promoting gut motility, and its primary mechanism of action as an antibiotic is the inhibition of peptide translocation at the 50S ribosomal subunit.",9
8213,"The patient has a history of a very productive cough, recurrent respiratory infections, and occasional wheezing, which are indicative of chronic bronchitis, a form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Chronic bronchitis is characterized by hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the mucus-secreting glands in the airways, leading to increased mucus production. This results in an increased number and activity of goblet cells in the bronchial epithelium. The other options are less likely: interstitial fibrosis is associated with restrictive lung diseases, pleural plaques are associated with asbestos exposure, and ferruginous bodies are also related to asbestos exposure.",9
8226,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest she is likely pregnant. She has a 4-week menstrual delay, irritability, increased somnolence, occasional nausea, and signs of early pregnancy such as breast engorgement, nipple pigmentation, and cervical softening and cyanosis (Chadwick's sign). Given that she stopped using birth control 6 months ago and has been sexually active, pregnancy is a strong possibility. In early pregnancy, folic acid is recommended to prevent neural tube defects in the developing fetus. Progesterone, vitamin A, and a combination of estrogen and progestin are not typically recommended for a healthy early pregnancy. Therefore, folic acid is the appropriate choice.",9
8225,"The newborn presents with signs of respiratory distress and diffuse ground-glass opacifications on chest X-ray, which are indicative of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). This condition is commonly due to surfactant deficiency, which is more likely in preterm infants. The infant was born at 34 weeks gestation, which increases the risk of RDS due to immature lungs and insufficient surfactant production. Gestational diabetes can delay fetal lung maturity and increase the risk of RDS. The other options, such as alcohol abuse, Down syndrome, and lithium exposure, are not directly associated with surfactant deficiency or RDS in the same way that gestational diabetes is.",9
8227,"Tanner stage 2 is characterized by the beginning of physical changes associated with puberty. In females, Tanner stage 2 includes thelarche, which is the development of breast buds. This is one of the earliest signs of puberty in girls. Pubarche, which refers to the appearance of pubic hair, also begins at Tanner stage 2, but the question asks specifically for a sign of Tanner stage 2, and thelarche is more directly associated with this stage. Adrenarche refers to the increase in adrenal androgens, which occurs slightly earlier, and coarse pubic hair is a feature of later Tanner stages.",9
8216,"The patient's symptoms of fever, severe headache, nuchal rigidity, and photophobia are indicative of meningitis. Given his age and the lack of vaccinations, Neisseria meningitidis is a likely cause of bacterial meningitis in this scenario. Neisseria meningitidis is a gram-negative diplococcus that is known for causing meningitis, especially in young adults and those in close living quarters, such as college dormitories. The quellung reaction is used to identify encapsulated bacteria, and Neisseria meningitidis has a polysaccharide capsule that can be identified by a positive quellung reaction. Therefore, the bacteria causing these symptoms would most likely demonstrate a positive quellung reaction.",9
8238,"The key detail in the question is the presence of frequent disseminated mycobacterial infections in the infant. This type of infection is commonly associated with defects in the interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) signaling pathway. IFN-γ is crucial for the activation of macrophages and the control of intracellular pathogens, including mycobacteria. A defect in this pathway would lead to an inability to effectively control mycobacterial infections, resulting in the recurrent disseminated infections observed in this patient. Other options, such as B-cell maturation defects (A) and BTK gene defects (D), are associated with antibody deficiencies and would not specifically lead to disseminated mycobacterial infections. An ATM gene defect (B) is related to ataxia-telangiectasia, which involves DNA repair issues and immunodeficiency, but not specifically mycobacterial infections. Therefore, the most likely cause of the immunodeficiency in this case is a defect in interferon-gamma signaling.",9
8231,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of Ebstein's anomaly, a congenital heart defect characterized by apical displacement of the tricuspid valve, leading to right atrial enlargement and associated arrhythmias. The widely split first heart sound and holosystolic murmur are consistent with tricuspid regurgitation, which is common in Ebstein's anomaly. The cyanosis and right bundle branch block further support this diagnosis. Ebstein's anomaly is known to be associated with maternal use of lithium during pregnancy. Given the patient's history of bipolar disorder and the use of lithium, it is likely that her mother was treated with lithium during pregnancy, leading to the development of Ebstein's anomaly in the patient.",9
8240,"The tests described are the Rinne and Weber tests, which help differentiate between conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. 

1. **Rinne Test**: The tuning fork is placed on the mastoid bone and then near the ear. Normally, air conduction (near the ear) is better than bone conduction (on the mastoid), which is what the patient reports on both sides. This indicates no conductive hearing loss on either side.

2. **Weber Test**: The tuning fork is placed on the forehead. In sensorineural hearing loss, the sound lateralizes to the better-hearing ear, while in conductive hearing loss, it lateralizes to the affected ear. The patient hears the sound better on the right side, suggesting sensorineural hearing loss on the left side.

Given these findings, the patient likely has sensorineural hearing loss on the left side. Acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma) on the left side can cause sensorineural hearing loss, making option C the most consistent with the findings.",9
8241,"The patient is HIV-positive and presents with fever and hemoptysis, and the chest radiograph shows a fibrocavitary lesion. The biopsy reveals septate hyphae that branch at acute angles. This description is characteristic of Aspergillus species, particularly Aspergillus fumigatus, which is known to cause invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, especially in immunocompromised individuals like those with HIV. Candida albicans typically presents as yeast and pseudohyphae, not septate hyphae. Pneumocystis jeroveci, while common in HIV patients, does not present with septate hyphae. Naegleria fowleri is a free-living amoeba and not associated with this type of lung infection. Therefore, the most likely causal organism is Aspergillus fumigatus.",9
8258,"The patient is a pregnant woman with symptoms and urinalysis findings consistent with a urinary tract infection (UTI). In pregnancy, it is important to confirm the diagnosis and ensure appropriate treatment, as UTIs can lead to complications such as pyelonephritis. Nitrofurantoin is a common choice for treating UTIs in pregnancy. However, to guide therapy and confirm the presence of a UTI, a urine culture should be performed. This will identify the specific bacteria and their antibiotic sensitivities, ensuring that the prescribed antibiotic is appropriate. Therefore, the next best step in management is to send a urine culture.",9
8244,"The patient is a 78-year-old man with persistent back pain that worsened after moving heavy furniture. He also reports a recent 15-pound weight loss and constipation. His lab results show anemia (hemoglobin 11 g/dL), elevated creatinine (1.6 mg/dL), and hypercalcemia (Ca2+ 11.8 mg/dL). The combination of back pain, anemia, renal impairment, and hypercalcemia is suggestive of multiple myeloma, a type of plasma cell dyscrasia. The back pain could be due to bone lesions or fractures common in multiple myeloma. The weight loss and constipation can also be associated with this condition. The presence of a heart murmur and mild crackles are not directly related to the primary diagnosis but could be incidental findings in an elderly patient. The normal leukocyte count and platelet count, along with the absence of neurological deficits, make other diagnoses like muscle strain, herniated disc, or piriformis syndrome less likely. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is plasma cell dyscrasia.",9
8259,"The patient's symptoms and occupational history suggest lead poisoning, especially given his work on an old house with potential lead exposure. The microcytic, hypochromic anemia with basophilic stippling is characteristic of lead poisoning. The best treatment for lead poisoning, particularly in adults with significant symptoms, is chelation therapy. EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is a chelating agent used to treat lead poisoning. Deferoxamine is used for iron poisoning, Prussian blue is used for thallium or cesium poisoning, and N-acetylcysteine is used for acetaminophen overdose. Therefore, the best treatment for this patient's symptoms is EDTA.",9
8261,"The clinical presentation suggests developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), particularly with the findings of a shortened leg, asymmetry of skin folds, and a clunk on hip abduction (Ortolani maneuver). In infants under 6 months of age, ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality for evaluating hip dysplasia because the femoral head is not yet ossified and cannot be adequately visualized on X-ray. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to perform an ultrasound of the hips to confirm the diagnosis of DDH.",9
8264,"The patient presents with secondary amenorrhea, low BMI, and excessive exercise, which are suggestive of an eating disorder, likely anorexia nervosa. In anorexia nervosa, patients often have electrolyte imbalances due to malnutrition and possible purging behaviors. Hypokalemic alkalosis is commonly associated with bulimia nervosa due to vomiting, but it can also occur in anorexia if there is purging. However, the more common finding in anorexia nervosa due to malnutrition and dehydration is orthostatic hypotension (orthostasis). This is due to volume depletion and electrolyte imbalances. Primary amenorrhea is not applicable here as the patient had previous menstrual cycles. Hypocholesterolemia is not typically associated with anorexia; in fact, hypercholesterolemia can occur. Therefore, the most likely additional finding in this patient is orthostasis.",9
8248,"The patient's symptoms and history are suggestive of Lyme disease, which is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi. The key clues include the recent camping trip in Delaware, a region where Lyme disease is endemic, and the presence of a characteristic rash known as erythema migrans, which is described as a red, erythematous, round rash with central clearing. The absence of antibodies against Proteus vulgaris OX-19 helps rule out rickettsial infections, which are not consistent with the presentation. The other options, such as measles virus, Chlamydia trachomatis, and dermatophytosis, do not match the clinical presentation or the geographic and exposure history.",9
8266,"The patient presents with symptoms and behaviors suggestive of an eating disorder, likely anorexia nervosa. Her diet is extremely restrictive, and she exercises excessively. She has secondary amenorrhea, fatigue, feeling cold, and lanugo, which are common in anorexia nervosa. Her physical examination reveals a thin girl, which suggests a low body weight. In anorexia nervosa, patients often have a BMI less than 17, which is a diagnostic criterion for the disorder. The other options are less consistent with her presentation: normal serum iron levels and increased hemoglobin are not typical findings, and moist, supple skin is unlikely given her probable malnutrition.",9
8272,"The clinical presentation of this 2-year-old boy suggests cystic fibrosis (CF). Key features include recurrent respiratory infections, sinusitis, loose stools that are difficult to flush (suggestive of malabsorption), history of meconium ileus, and nasal polyps. CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, leading to thickened secretions in various organs. This results in pancreatic insufficiency, causing malabsorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Vitamin K deficiency can lead to coagulopathy, which manifests as an elevated prothrombin time (PT).",9
8275,"The clinical description of the lesion—a pink nodule with rolled borders, telangiectasias, and central ulceration—is characteristic of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). BCC is the most common type of skin cancer and typically presents with these features. The histologic hallmark of basal cell carcinoma is the presence of nests of basaloid cells with peripheral palisading of the nuclei. This means that the nuclei of the cells at the edges of the nests are aligned in a parallel fashion, resembling a palisade. This feature helps distinguish BCC from other skin lesions.",9
8277,"The patient initially presented with hypertension and was treated, but now returns with bilateral edema in her extremities. This suggests that the antihypertensive medication she was started on may be causing fluid retention. Calcium channel blockers, often used for hypertension, can cause peripheral edema as a side effect. The best management for this situation is to address the underlying cause of the edema. Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, can be added to counteract the edema caused by calcium channel blockers. This combination is often used because ACE inhibitors can reduce the edema associated with calcium channel blockers.",9
8278,"The patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is evident from the elevated creatinine level and history. CKD often leads to anemia due to the kidneys' inability to produce adequate erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates red blood cell production in the bone marrow. The patient's fatigue and pallor, along with the low hemoglobin level, are consistent with anemia. Other options, such as metabolic acidosis, medication side effects, or uremic retention, do not directly explain the specific mechanism of decreased hemoglobin production. Therefore, the most likely cause of the anemia in this patient is the failure of adequate erythropoietin production due to CKD.",9
8283,"The study described involves identifying two groups of patients based on their exposure status (cocaine use) and then following them over time to see if they develop the outcome of interest (syphilis). This is characteristic of a cohort study, where subjects are grouped by exposure and followed to observe outcomes. Since the investigators are looking back at medical records to identify these groups and outcomes, it is a retrospective cohort study. A meta-analysis involves combining data from multiple studies, a case series describes a group of cases with a particular outcome, and a case-control study starts with the outcome and looks back to find exposures.",9
8290,"To determine the location of the disease gene, we need to consider the pattern of inheritance shown in the pedigree. If the disease is inherited in a mitochondrial pattern, it would be passed from mother to all her children, as mitochondria are inherited maternally. This would suggest the gene is located on mitochondrial DNA, which is circular. If the inheritance pattern is autosomal or sex-linked, the gene would be on nuclear DNA, which is double-stranded. Single-stranded DNA in the cytoplasm and helical RNA in the cytoplasm are not typical locations for genes involved in inheritance patterns seen in pedigrees. Given the options, if the pattern is consistent with mitochondrial inheritance, the gene would be on circular DNA in the mitochondrion.",9
8270,"The patient presents with sudden onset of inability to use her left hand, with no physical or neurological abnormalities found on examination or MRI. This occurs after a stressful event involving her family. The lack of physical findings and the context of emotional distress suggest a psychological origin. Conversion disorder, also known as functional neurological symptom disorder, involves neurological symptoms that cannot be explained by medical evaluation and often occur after stress. The patient's symptoms are consistent with conversion disorder, as there is no evidence of malingering (intentional production of symptoms for external gain), ischemic stroke (which would show abnormalities on MRI), or borderline personality disorder (which involves a pattern of unstable relationships and self-image, not sudden neurological symptoms).",9
8279,"The patient is a pregnant woman at 25 weeks' gestation presenting with symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with acute pyelonephritis. She has fever, flank pain, chills, nausea, vomiting, and significant pyuria and bacteriuria. In pregnancy, pyelonephritis is a serious condition that requires inpatient management due to the risk of complications such as preterm labor and sepsis. Oral ciprofloxacin is not appropriate due to its contraindication in pregnancy. Renal ultrasound is not immediately necessary unless there is suspicion of an obstruction or abscess. The standard inpatient treatment for pyelonephritis in pregnancy is intravenous antibiotics. Both ceftriaxone and the combination of ampicillin and gentamicin are options, but ceftriaxone is often preferred due to its broad spectrum and safety profile in pregnancy.",9
8282,"The patient presents with progressive shortness of breath, mild chest pain on exertion, and a cough following a recent upper respiratory infection. He has a history of smoking, which is a significant risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). His vital signs show tachycardia and tachypnea, and he is in respiratory distress. The arterial blood gas analysis reveals a respiratory acidosis (low pH, elevated PCO2) with partial metabolic compensation (elevated HCO3-), which is consistent with a COPD exacerbation. The reduced breath sounds and wheezing are also common in COPD exacerbations. The inward displacement of the abdomen during inspiration suggests diaphragmatic fatigue, often seen in severe COPD exacerbations. While acute asthma exacerbation could present similarly, the patient's age and smoking history make COPD more likely. Pulmonary embolism and heart failure are less consistent with the ABG findings and clinical presentation.",9
8298,"The patient has developed a fever and erythema around the central venous catheter insertion site, suggesting a catheter-related infection. The blood cultures reveal gram-positive, catalase-positive cocci. The fact that these bacteria have a low minimum inhibitory concentration when exposed to novobiocin indicates that they are likely Staphylococcus epidermidis, which is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus that is sensitive to novobiocin. Staphylococcus epidermidis is a common cause of catheter-related bloodstream infections. The most appropriate treatment for infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci, especially in the context of a hospital-acquired infection, is Vancomycin, due to the high likelihood of methicillin resistance in these strains.",9
8300,"The patient has developed thrombocytopenia after starting heparin, as evidenced by the drop in platelet count from 157,000/mm^3 to 22,000/mm^3 over 6 days. This is suggestive of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), a condition where antibodies form against platelet factor 4 complexed with heparin, leading to platelet activation and a pro-thrombotic state. The most appropriate management step in suspected HIT is to stop heparin immediately to prevent further complications. Blood transfusion and platelet transfusion are not indicated for HIT, and continuing heparin without changes would be inappropriate given the risk of thrombosis.",9
8303,"The clinical presentation suggests a chromosomal disorder. The patient has tall stature, gynecomastia, and hypogonadism (reduced scrotal size, lack of axillary hair), which are characteristic features of Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY). The midsystolic click could be related to mitral valve prolapse, which is sometimes associated with this condition. Karyotyping is the test that would confirm the presence of an extra X chromosome, diagnosing Klinefelter syndrome.",9
8302,"The patient is an elderly woman presenting with symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder, including difficulty sleeping, fatigue, decreased appetite, weight loss, feelings of guilt, anhedonia, and a flattened affect. Given her age and recent significant life stressor (the death of her husband), it is crucial to assess the severity of her depression, particularly the risk of suicide, which can be higher in elderly patients with depression. Assessing for suicidal ideation is a critical step in ensuring her safety and determining the urgency and type of intervention needed.",9
8305,"The patient is presenting with signs of an upper gastrointestinal bleed, likely due to esophageal varices secondary to his alcoholic cirrhosis. His hypotension (blood pressure of 80/52 mm Hg) and confusion suggest hemodynamic instability and possible hypovolemic shock. In such cases, the best initial management is to stabilize the patient. This involves securing the airway if necessary, providing intravenous fluids to restore blood volume, and administering vasoactive drugs to control the bleeding. Endoscopic therapy is also crucial to directly address the source of bleeding. Therefore, the best initial management is combined vasoactive and endoscopic therapy.",9
8306,"The clinical presentation suggests a photosensitivity reaction, likely due to erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP). EPP is characterized by painful photosensitivity, erythema, and edema after sun exposure, without blistering or scarring. The symptoms are due to the accumulation of protoporphyrin in the skin, which reacts to sunlight. Beta carotene is used in EPP to reduce photosensitivity by quenching reactive oxygen species and providing some photoprotection. Other options like dexamethasone, phlebotomy, and chloroquine are not appropriate for EPP. Dexamethasone is used for inflammatory conditions, phlebotomy is used for hemochromatosis or polycythemia, and chloroquine is used for malaria or certain autoimmune conditions.",9
8307,"The clinical presentation of the 8-month-old boy, including poor feeding, floppiness, lethargy, drooling, flaccid muscle tone, and bilateral ptosis, is suggestive of infant botulism. This condition is caused by the ingestion of Clostridium botulinum spores, which then germinate and produce toxin in the infant's intestines. The toxin blocks acetylcholine release at neuromuscular junctions, leading to the symptoms observed. The recent introduction of pureed foods could be a source of the spores. The key pathophysiological mechanism here is the ingestion of spores that produce toxin in vivo, not the ingestion of a preformed toxin, which is more typical in foodborne botulism in adults. However, the closest option that describes the pathophysiology related to botulinum toxin is 'ingestion of a preformed toxin,' even though it doesn't perfectly match the infant scenario.",9
8308,"The patient's symptoms of increasing confusion, episodes of staring off into space, memory issues, and balance problems, along with a history of falls, suggest a neurological issue. The recent fall 3 weeks ago is significant, especially given his use of anticoagulants (warfarin), which increases the risk of bleeding. The symptoms of headache, nausea, and vomiting further support a possible intracranial issue. Subdural hematoma is a common condition in elderly patients, especially those on anticoagulants, following a fall. The gradual onset of symptoms over weeks aligns with a chronic subdural hematoma, which can cause cognitive changes and balance issues. Alzheimer's disease typically presents with more gradual cognitive decline without the acute changes seen here. Ischemic stroke would likely present with more acute focal neurological deficits. Vitamin B12 deficiency could cause cognitive issues but is less likely given the acute change following trauma and the lack of other typical symptoms like peripheral neuropathy.",9
8309,"The symptoms described in the vignette are characteristic of croup, also known as laryngotracheobronchitis, which is common in young children. The key features include a barking cough, stridor (high-pitched inspiratory sound), and hoarseness. These symptoms are due to inflammation and narrowing of the airway. In croup, the narrowing typically occurs in the subglottic region of the larynx, which is below the vocal cords. This area is particularly susceptible to swelling in young children, leading to the characteristic symptoms. The presence of stridor and the barking cough strongly suggest subglottic narrowing rather than issues in the distal trachea, pharynx, or bronchioles.",9
8312,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a chronic viral hepatitis infection, likely hepatitis C, given her history of intravenous drug use and the description of the virus as a positive-sense RNA virus that is small, enveloped, and single-stranded. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) fits this description. The treatment for HCV often includes antiviral medications. Ribavirin is a drug that resembles a purine RNA nucleotide and is used in combination with other medications to treat hepatitis C. The warning about not getting pregnant is consistent with ribavirin, as it is teratogenic. Simeprevir is a protease inhibitor used in HCV treatment but does not resemble a purine RNA nucleotide. Interferon-alpha is an immune modulator, and cidofovir is used for DNA viruses, not RNA viruses like HCV. Therefore, the drug given to the patient is most likely ribavirin.",9
8314,"The patient's symptoms and presentation suggest multiple myeloma. The key features include lower back pain, generalized weakness, weight loss, foamy urine (indicative of proteinuria), midline spinal tenderness, and conjunctival pallor (suggesting anemia). The bone marrow biopsy in multiple myeloma typically shows plasma cell proliferation. In multiple myeloma, the presence of monoclonal proteins can cause red blood cells to stack together in a rouleaux formation, which is described as a stacked-coin appearance. This is due to the increased serum protein levels affecting the charge between red blood cells. Therefore, the most likely finding in further evaluation would be grouped erythrocytes with a stacked-coin appearance.",9
8315,"The patient has chronic atrophic gastritis with intestinal metaplasia and destruction of parietal cells. This condition is often associated with autoimmune gastritis, where the immune system attacks the stomach lining, particularly the parietal cells. This autoimmune process is mediated by T cells, which leads to the destruction of parietal cells and can result in pernicious anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency. 

Let's evaluate the options:

A. Folate deficiency is not typically caused by chronic atrophic gastritis; it is more commonly associated with vitamin B12 deficiency.

B. While Helicobacter pylori (a gram-negative, urease-positive bacterium) can cause chronic gastritis, the presence of intestinal metaplasia and parietal cell destruction suggests an autoimmune process rather than H. pylori infection.

C. MALT lymphoma is more commonly associated with H. pylori infection rather than autoimmune gastritis.

D. In autoimmune gastritis, the destruction of the gastric mucosa, particularly the parietal cells, is mediated by T cells. This is characteristic of the autoimmune process involved in this condition.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.",9
8316,"The patient's presentation is consistent with acute arterial occlusion of the left leg, likely due to an embolism given his irregular pulse, which suggests atrial fibrillation. The sudden onset of severe pain, numbness, weakness, and absent pulses in the left leg, along with the leg being cold and pale, are classic signs of acute limb ischemia. In such cases, immediate revascularization is necessary to restore blood flow and prevent tissue damage. Thromboembolectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the embolus and restore circulation, which is often required in acute limb ischemia. Fasciotomy is used to relieve compartment syndrome, which is not indicated here as there is no mention of swelling or compartment pressure. Warfarin is used for long-term anticoagulation but is not an immediate treatment for acute ischemia. Antibiotics are not indicated as there is no infection. Therefore, the most likely required intervention is thromboembolectomy.",9
8320,"The patient is experiencing symptoms of heart failure, including shortness of breath, jugular venous distention, crackles, and edema. The treatment involves a drug that acts by altering guanylate cyclase activity, which is a mechanism associated with natriuretic peptides. These peptides, such as brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), work by increasing cyclic GMP through guanylate cyclase activation, leading to vasodilation and diuresis. This reduces pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, which is consistent with the effects described. Systemic hypotension is a known adverse effect of drugs that cause vasodilation. Therefore, the drug is most likely a derivative of brain natriuretic peptide.",9
8324,"Clinical trials are conducted in phases to assess different aspects of a drug's safety and efficacy. Phase I trials are the first stage of testing in human subjects and are primarily concerned with assessing the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of a drug. These trials typically involve a small number of healthy volunteers (usually 20-80) and aim to determine the maximum tolerated dose and identify any side effects. The scenario described involves 20 volunteers and focuses on safety and toxicity, which aligns with the objectives of a Phase I trial.",9
8329,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a deficiency in vitamin C, leading to scurvy. The key symptoms include spontaneous bruising, swollen gums, petechiae, and poor dentition, which are classic signs of scurvy. Vitamin C is crucial for the hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues in collagen synthesis. A deficiency impairs collagen formation, leading to the symptoms observed. Therefore, the metabolic deficiency involved is the hydroxylation of lysine residues.",9
8331,"The clinical presentation of this 8-month-old boy is suggestive of a lysosomal storage disorder. The key features include loss of developmental milestones, episodes of unresponsiveness, generalized hypotonia, hyperreflexia, extensor plantar response, and the presence of a cherry-red spot on fundoscopy. Additionally, the patient's Ashkenazi Jewish descent is a significant clue.

The cherry-red spot on the macula is a classic finding in certain lysosomal storage diseases, particularly Tay-Sachs disease and Niemann-Pick disease. Tay-Sachs disease is caused by a deficiency of β-hexosaminidase A, leading to the accumulation of GM2 gangliosides in neurons. This results in neurodegeneration, developmental regression, and the characteristic cherry-red spot.

Niemann-Pick disease, caused by sphingomyelinase deficiency, can also present with a cherry-red spot, but it typically includes hepatosplenomegaly, which is not mentioned in this case.

The absence of hepatosplenomegaly and the specific ethnic background strongly point towards Tay-Sachs disease as the most likely diagnosis.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is β-hexosaminidase A deficiency.",9
8325,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of nephrotic syndrome, characterized by frothy urine, generalized edema, and significant proteinuria (5.2 g/24 hours). The urinalysis shows 4+ protein and fat globules, which are consistent with nephrotic syndrome. The patient is HIV positive, which is a key factor in determining the underlying renal pathology.

In HIV-positive patients, the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome is Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), particularly the collapsing variant. This condition is more prevalent in African American individuals and is associated with HIV infection.

Minimal change disease is less common in adults and not typically associated with HIV. Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis are more associated with nephritic syndrome, which would present with hematuria and hypertension, not the nephrotic syndrome seen here.

Therefore, given the patient's HIV status, ethnicity, and nephrotic presentation, the most likely diagnosis is Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis.",9
8333,"The patient's hemoglobin A1c level indicates that his diabetes is not well-controlled, so an additional medication is needed. The question describes a drug that reversibly inhibits a membrane-bound enzyme that hydrolyzes carbohydrate bonds. This description matches the mechanism of action of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, which work by inhibiting enzymes in the brush border of the small intestine, delaying carbohydrate absorption. Miglitol is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, making it the correct choice. Linagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, Canagliflozin is an SGLT2 inhibitor, and Rosiglitazone is a thiazolidinedione, none of which match the described mechanism.",10
8336,"The patient's symptoms include excessive daytime sleepiness, dreamlike states before falling asleep and after waking up (hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations), and episodes of sleep paralysis. These symptoms are characteristic of narcolepsy. The absence of snoring and a normal BMI make obstructive sleep apnea less likely. Delayed sleep phase syndrome typically involves difficulty falling asleep and waking up at conventional times, which is not described here. Alcohol withdrawal is unlikely given the patient's denial of alcohol use. Therefore, the most fitting diagnosis is narcolepsy.",9
8338,"The patient's symptoms and biopsy findings suggest a laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. The change in voice, specifically becoming higher pitched, indicates possible involvement of the vocal cords. The intrinsic muscles of the larynx, which control the tension and position of the vocal cords, are derived from the 4th and 6th branchial arches. The cricothyroid muscle, which is responsible for tensing the vocal cords and thus affecting pitch, is derived from the 4th branchial arch. Involvement of this muscle could lead to changes in voice pitch. Therefore, the muscle affected by the tumor is likely derived from the 4th arch.",9
8337,"The patient's symptoms include fatigue, difficulty concentrating, excessive daytime sleepiness, and disrupted sleep with frequent awakenings. He is obese with a large neck circumference, which are risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is characterized by repeated episodes of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway during sleep, leading to disrupted sleep and daytime fatigue. The elevated blood pressure and obesity further support this diagnosis. Chronic fatigue syndrome is less likely given the specific sleep-related symptoms and risk factors. Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder typically involves a mismatch between the patient's sleep pattern and the desired schedule, which doesn't fit this case. Hypothyroidism could cause fatigue but would likely present with additional symptoms such as weight gain, cold intolerance, and bradycardia, which are not mentioned here.",9
8344,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of gas gangrene, which is often caused by Clostridium perfringens. The key findings include high fever, hypotension, a toxic appearance, tense bullae, and crepitus in the affected area. Clostridium perfringens produces several toxins, but the most notable one responsible for the tissue destruction and gas formation in gas gangrene is the alpha toxin. Alpha toxin is a phospholipase that damages cell membranes, leading to cell lysis and tissue necrosis, which explains the crepitus and bullae formation. The other toxins listed do not match the clinical scenario: Botulinum toxin causes flaccid paralysis, cytotoxin is a general term not specific to this condition, and tetanospasmin causes muscle spasms and rigidity.",9
8345,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings are suggestive of nephrotic syndrome, characterized by significant proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. The urinalysis shows 4+ protein and fat globules, which are indicative of nephrotic syndrome. The 24-hour urine protein excretion is 4.1 g, confirming significant proteinuria. The renal biopsy shows normal glomeruli on light microscopy, which is characteristic of minimal change disease (also known as lipoid nephrosis). This condition is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children and typically presents with normal glomeruli on light microscopy, with changes only visible on electron microscopy (effacement of podocyte foot processes).",9
8346,"The patient is seeking emergency contraception after unprotected intercourse due to a condom failure. The options for emergency contraception include ulipristal acetate, levonorgestrel, and the copper IUD. Ethinyl estradiol is not typically used alone for emergency contraception. 

- Ulipristal acetate is effective up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse.
- Levonorgestrel is most effective within 72 hours but can be used up to 5 days, though its effectiveness decreases over time.
- The copper IUD can be used as emergency contraception up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse and is the most effective method.

Since the patient is 6 days post-intercourse, ulipristal acetate and levonorgestrel are not options as they are beyond their effective time frames. The copper IUD is the only option that remains effective up to 5 days and sometimes beyond, depending on the timing of ovulation.

Therefore, the best recommendation for this patient is the copper IUD.",9
8356,"The patient is performing the Valsalva maneuver, which consists of four phases. During the initial phase (Phase I), there is an increase in intrathoracic pressure, which compresses the aorta and transiently increases mean arterial pressure (MAP). This increase in MAP leads to increased baroreceptor activity, which in turn increases parasympathetic outflow and decreases heart rate. Therefore, the first hemodynamic change observed during the Valsalva maneuver is an increase in MAP, followed by a decrease in heart rate due to increased baroreceptor activity and increased parasympathetic outflow.",9
8353,"The patient's symptoms of tingling, cramping, and carpopedal spasm, along with a history of alcohol use, suggest hypomagnesemia. Alcoholism is a common cause of magnesium deficiency, which can lead to neuromuscular excitability and symptoms like tetany and hyperreflexia. The carpopedal spasm observed during blood pressure measurement is indicative of this condition. The most appropriate treatment for hypomagnesemia is magnesium sulfate.",9
8256,,0
8360,"The patient is experiencing hypoglycemia, likely due to fasting and possibly increased physical activity or stress. Her symptoms of anxiety, sweating, and trembling are consistent with adrenergic responses to hypoglycemia. In response to low blood glucose, the body typically increases glucagon secretion, which promotes glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis to raise blood glucose levels. Epinephrine also plays a role in stimulating these processes. Option A is incorrect because increased insulin secretion would lower blood glucose further, not raise it. Option B is plausible as glycogenolysis is a primary response to hypoglycemia. Option C is incorrect because while epinephrine does stimulate gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis is the more immediate response. Option D is incorrect because hypoglycemia stimulates, not inhibits, glucagon release.",9
8371,"The patient is a 20-year-old male with a BMI of 29 kg/m2, indicating he is overweight. His fasting glucose is at the upper limit of normal (100 mg/dL), and his triglycerides are elevated (184 mg/dL). These factors, along with his family history of type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, put him at risk for metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. Weight reduction would address multiple risk factors simultaneously: it can help lower his fasting glucose, reduce triglycerides, and decrease his risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. While increasing dietary fiber can also be beneficial, weight reduction would have a more comprehensive impact on his overall health. Increasing water intake and starting a multivitamin are less directly impactful on his current health concerns.",9
8364,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of a systemic vasculitis. The key findings include hemoptysis, renal involvement (elevated creatinine, proteinuria, hematuria with RBC casts), and palpable purpura on the skin. The skin biopsy shows inflammation of arterioles and capillaries without granuloma formation, which is indicative of a small vessel vasculitis. The presence of myalgia, fatigue, and elevated ESR further supports this.

The differential diagnosis for small vessel vasculitis with these findings includes microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). However, the absence of granulomas on biopsy and the presence of renal involvement with RBC casts point towards microscopic polyangiitis.

Microscopic polyangiitis is associated with the presence of myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (MPO-ANCA), also known as p-ANCA. This is consistent with the clinical presentation and biopsy findings in this patient.

Therefore, further evaluation is most likely to show the presence of myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA).",9
8362,"The patient is a 9-year-old boy with symptoms of pneumonia and otitis media, and cultures have identified Moraxella catarrhalis as the causative organism. Moraxella catarrhalis is a Gram-negative diplococcus that commonly causes respiratory tract infections, including otitis media and pneumonia, especially in children. It is often resistant to penicillin due to beta-lactamase production, so antibiotics that are effective against beta-lactamase-producing organisms are preferred.

Cefadroxil is a first-generation cephalosporin, which is not typically effective against beta-lactamase-producing Moraxella catarrhalis.

Doxycycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that is effective against Moraxella catarrhalis, but it is generally not recommended for children under 8 years old due to the risk of permanent tooth discoloration.

Linezolid is an antibiotic used for Gram-positive infections, particularly resistant strains like MRSA and VRE, and is not appropriate for Moraxella catarrhalis.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is effective against Moraxella catarrhalis and is a suitable choice for treating infections caused by this organism.

Therefore, the antibiotic of choice for this patient is Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.",9
8378,"The clinical presentation suggests a primary immunodeficiency. The key features include recurrent infections, delayed umbilical cord separation, and a high leukocyte count with neutrophilia. The blood cultures growing catalase-positive yeast cells that form pseudohyphae indicate a Candida infection, which is common in patients with immune deficiencies. The delayed umbilical cord separation and recurrent bacterial infections suggest leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD), which is caused by defective beta-2 integrin. This defect leads to impaired neutrophil adhesion and migration, resulting in recurrent infections and delayed wound healing.",9
8375,"The patient is a professional cyclist with small testes and acne, which are suggestive of anabolic steroid use. Anabolic steroids can lead to testicular atrophy and infertility due to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. The low pulse rate and high blood pressure are also consistent with steroid use. Heat from friction is unlikely to cause infertility, and anorexia nervosa is not suggested by the patient's athletic build and dietary consciousness. Kallmann syndrome would have presented with delayed puberty, which is not the case here.",9
8372,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction (MI), given the sudden onset of chest pain, nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis. The hypotension (BP 80/50 mm Hg) and bradycardia (pulse 50/min) are particularly indicative of an inferior wall MI, which is often associated with right coronary artery (RCA) occlusion. The RCA supplies the inferior wall of the heart and the sinoatrial (SA) node in most individuals, which can lead to bradycardia. The combination of hypotension and bradycardia is classic for an inferior MI due to RCA obstruction. The ECG findings, although not provided here, would likely show ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, which are indicative of an inferior MI. Therefore, the most likely obstruction is in the right coronary artery.",9
8384,"The patient presents with signs of acute abdominal pain, fever, hypotension, and ascites, with laboratory findings suggestive of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The ascitic fluid analysis shows a high neutrophil count (658 PMNs/µL), low protein, low glucose, and growth of E. coli, which are consistent with SBP. The presence of gram-negative rods and E. coli in the culture further supports this diagnosis. In SBP, the first-line treatment is the administration of intravenous antibiotics, specifically a third-generation cephalosporin like cefotaxime. Surgical consultation is not indicated as there is no evidence of a surgical abdomen or perforation. Serum lipase level and abdominal imaging are not the immediate priorities in this scenario. Therefore, the next best step is to start intravenous cefotaxime.",9
8386,"The patient's presentation and laboratory findings are suggestive of a hematologic disorder. The bone marrow biopsy shows cells that are CD19+, CD20+, CD11c+, and stain with acid phosphatase 5 and tartrate-resistant, which are characteristic of hairy cell leukemia. This condition is a type of chronic B-cell leukemia. The treatment of choice for hairy cell leukemia is cladribine, a purine analog that is effective in inducing remission in this disease. Hydroxyurea is used for myeloproliferative disorders, filgrastim is a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor used to treat neutropenia, and doxorubicin is used in various other cancers but not typically for hairy cell leukemia.",9
8323,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of ischemic cardiac event recurrence, particularly following a recent myocardial infarction and angioplasty. The presence of new T-wave inversions on his ECG suggests possible myocardial ischemia or infarction. To rapidly diagnose reinfarction, especially within a short period after a previous infarction where baseline troponin levels may remain elevated, creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) is preferred due to its faster clearance compared to troponins. CK-MB normalizes within 2-3 days, making it more suitable for detecting reinfarction or new episodes in this time frame, unlike troponins which can remain elevated for a longer duration.",9
8393,"The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of cervical cancer treated 5 years ago. She presents with postmenopausal bleeding, dyspareunia, and vaginal discharge. On examination, there is an irregular mass protruding from the vaginal wall. Given her history of cervical cancer, the presence of a mass in the vaginal wall suggests a recurrence or metastasis of the cervical cancer. Direct extension is a common route for cervical cancer recurrence, especially considering the proximity of the cervix to the vagina. Hematogenous spread is less common for cervical cancer, and primary vaginal cancer is less likely given her history. Atrophy of vaginal tissues would not typically present with a mass. Therefore, the most likely explanation is metastasis of cervical cancer via direct extension.",9
8389,"The patient was bitten by a raccoon, which is a high-risk animal for rabies transmission. The attack was unprovoked, increasing the suspicion for rabies. Although the patient received rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) in the past, he is not considered immune for life. For rabies, previous PEP does not confer lifelong immunity, and a new exposure requires additional vaccination. However, rabies immunoglobulin is not needed for someone who has previously completed a rabies vaccination series. Therefore, the appropriate management is to administer the rabies vaccine again. Regarding tetanus, the patient received a booster at age 16, which covers him for 10 years, so no tetanus booster is needed at this time.",9
8392,"The patient has secondary amenorrhea following a D&C procedure, which suggests a structural cause. The negative progestin challenge test indicates that there is likely an issue with the endometrial lining, as there is no withdrawal bleeding. This is consistent with Asherman syndrome, which is characterized by intrauterine adhesions that can occur after surgical procedures like D&C. The normal hormone levels and negative pregnancy test further support this diagnosis, as they rule out other causes like hypothalamic hypoestrogenism or ectopic pregnancy.",9
8394,"The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus with poor glucose control (HbA1c of 8.5%) and obesity (BMI of 39 kg/m2). The goal is to improve glucose control and promote weight loss. 

- **Miglitol** is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor that delays carbohydrate absorption but does not promote weight loss.
- **Liraglutide** is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that improves glucose control and is known to promote weight loss. It is often used in patients with type 2 diabetes who are also obese.
- **Nateglinide** is a meglitinide that stimulates insulin secretion but does not affect weight.
- **Rosiglitazone** is a thiazolidinedione that improves insulin sensitivity but is associated with weight gain.

Given the need to address both glucose control and weight, liraglutide is the most appropriate choice.",9
8406,"The patient's symptoms of bilateral hearing loss, vertigo, and ataxia suggest ototoxicity, which is a known side effect of aminoglycoside antibiotics. Aminoglycosides are sometimes given prophylactically before surgery to prevent infections. The mechanism of action of aminoglycosides is the inhibition of the formation of the translation initiation complex by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, which leads to misreading of mRNA and inhibition of protein synthesis. Therefore, the mechanism of action of the drug likely responsible for these symptoms is inhibition of the formation of the translation initiation complex.",9
8408,"The patient is a 12-year-old boy with a history of atopic dermatitis, presenting with fever, malaise, and a painful, itchy rash on the shoulder that has worsened over 4 days. The presence of cervical lymphadenopathy suggests a systemic infection. Given his history of atopic dermatitis, he is at risk for eczema herpeticum, which is a superinfection of eczema with herpes simplex virus. This condition is characterized by painful vesicular lesions, fever, and lymphadenopathy. The other options are less likely: bed bug bites typically cause pruritic, erythematous lesions without systemic symptoms; nonbullous impetigo presents with honey-colored crusts and is not associated with systemic symptoms; Stevens-Johnson syndrome involves mucosal involvement and widespread skin lesions, which is not described here. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is eczema herpeticum.",9
8401,"The newborn has signs of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), indicated by the palpable clunk during hip abduction, which is a positive Ortolani test. The ultrasound finding of a 50° angle suggests hip dysplasia. In a 2-week-old infant with DDH, the most appropriate initial management is to use a Pavlik harness. This harness holds the hip in flexion and abduction, promoting proper development of the hip joint. Closed reduction is typically reserved for older infants or when the harness is ineffective. MRI is not necessary at this stage, and reassurance without intervention is inappropriate given the clinical findings.",9
8409,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of acute decompensated heart failure, likely due to noncompliance with medications and a history of myocardial infarction. The key findings include progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, bilateral crackles, an S3 gallop, and peripheral edema. These indicate fluid overload and pulmonary congestion. The immediate management should focus on relieving symptoms and reducing fluid overload. Intravenous diuretics, such as furosemide, are the standard treatment to rapidly reduce fluid overload and improve respiratory status in acute heart failure. Other options like beta blockers are not appropriate in the acute setting as they can worsen heart failure symptoms. Echocardiography and cardiac stress testing are diagnostic tools and not immediate management steps in this acute scenario.",9
8412,"The patient is described as having symptoms consistent with cystic fibrosis, such as thick secretions, chronic cough, and clubbing of the fingernails. The genetic test reveals a deletion of three nucleotides, which results in the loss of a phenylalanine at position 508. This specific mutation is known as ΔF508, the most common mutation causing cystic fibrosis. The deletion of three nucleotides does not disrupt the reading frame of the gene, as it removes a complete codon. Therefore, this is classified as an in-frame mutation, where the reading frame remains intact despite the deletion.",9
8421,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with anticholinergic toxicity, likely due to clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). Symptoms include palpitations, dizziness, chest discomfort, confusion, dilated pupils, dry skin, urinary retention, and abdominal distension. The ECG shows tachycardia and a widened QRS complex, which are characteristic of TCA overdose. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for TCA overdose with a widened QRS complex is sodium bicarbonate. Sodium bicarbonate helps to narrow the QRS complex and stabilize the cardiac membrane by increasing serum pH and sodium concentration, which counteracts the sodium channel blockade caused by TCAs.",9
8424,"The patient's symptoms of agitation, restlessness, tremors, sweating, headache, nausea, and hallucinations (asking about his father who is not present) are consistent with alcohol withdrawal syndrome. His history of daily alcohol consumption and increased intake on weekends further supports this diagnosis. The timeline of symptoms appearing shortly after surgery, when he has not consumed alcohol for a period, aligns with withdrawal. The most appropriate management for alcohol withdrawal is the administration of benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, to alleviate symptoms and prevent complications like seizures or delirium tremens.",9
8414,"The patient's symptoms and elevated urine metanephrines suggest a diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, a catecholamine-secreting tumor. The family history of medullary thyroid cancer and hyperparathyroidism suggests a possible MEN 2 syndrome, which is associated with pheochromocytoma. In managing pheochromocytoma, the first step is to control hypertension and prevent a hypertensive crisis. The appropriate first-line medication is an alpha-adrenergic blocker to counteract the effects of excess catecholamines. Phenoxybenzamine, a non-selective, irreversible alpha-blocker, is typically used first to control blood pressure and symptoms. Beta-blockers like propranolol or atenolol should only be added after adequate alpha-blockade to avoid unopposed alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation, which could worsen hypertension.",10
8425,"The patient presents with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, including palpitations, weight loss, and tremor. The laboratory findings show a low TSH and elevated thyroxine level, consistent with hyperthyroidism. The radioactive iodine uptake scan reveals enhancement in a specific nodule with decreased uptake in the rest of the gland, indicating that the nodule is autonomously producing thyroid hormone. This is characteristic of a toxic adenoma, where a single hyperfunctioning nodule causes hyperthyroidism. Graves' disease would typically show diffuse uptake, and thyroid storm is an acute, severe exacerbation of hyperthyroidism, not a chronic condition. A goiter is an enlargement of the thyroid gland, which can be associated with various thyroid conditions, but the specific findings here point to a toxic adenoma.",9
8416,"The patient presents with signs and symptoms consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), including hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis (low bicarbonate), and dehydration. In DKA, the initial management priorities are to address dehydration, correct electrolyte imbalances, and reduce blood glucose levels. 

1. **Fluid Replacement:** The first step in managing DKA is aggressive fluid resuscitation to address dehydration and improve perfusion. Normal saline is typically used initially.

2. **Electrolyte Correction:** The patient has hypokalemia (K+ = 2.9 mEq/L), which must be corrected before or alongside insulin administration. Insulin therapy can further lower potassium levels by driving potassium into cells, potentially leading to dangerous hypokalemia.

3. **Insulin Therapy:** Insulin is necessary to reduce blood glucose levels and correct the acidosis. However, insulin should not be started until potassium levels are above 3.3 mEq/L to avoid exacerbating hypokalemia.

Given these considerations, the best initial step in management is to start with normal saline for fluid resuscitation and potassium replacement to address the hypokalemia before initiating insulin therapy. Therefore, the best answer is C.",9

8446,"The patient has been trying to conceive for 3 years with regular menstrual cycles and normal semen analysis from her partner. Hormonal assays are normal, suggesting ovulatory cycles. The next step is to assess for tubal patency, as tubal factor infertility is a common cause of infertility in women with regular cycles and normal partner semen analysis. A hysterosalpingogram (HSG) is a radiologic procedure used to evaluate the patency of the fallopian tubes and the shape of the uterine cavity. It is a standard next step in the workup of infertility when other factors have been ruled out.",9
8451,"The patient presents with a painful genital ulcer and tender, fluctuant inguinal lymphadenopathy. The negative VDRL test makes syphilis (chancre) less likely, as chancres are typically painless and the VDRL test would often be positive. Condyloma acuminatum, caused by HPV, presents as warts rather than ulcers. Lymphogranuloma venereum typically presents with painless ulcers and significant lymphadenopathy, but the initial ulcer is usually not painful. Chancroid, caused by Haemophilus ducreyi, is characterized by painful genital ulcers and tender inguinal lymphadenopathy, which matches the patient's symptoms.",9
8453,"The patient's symptoms and biopsy findings are key to identifying the correct diagnosis. The presence of painless lymphadenopathy that becomes painful after alcohol consumption is a classic symptom associated with Hodgkin lymphoma. Additionally, the biopsy showing giant binucleate cells is indicative of Reed-Sternberg cells, which are characteristic of Hodgkin lymphoma. These features align with the diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma rather than the other options listed.",9
8447,"The patient presents with symptoms of severe respiratory distress, wheezing, and cardiac involvement (S3 gallop, dilated left ventricle with reduced ejection fraction). The laboratory findings show a significant eosinophilia (40% eosinophils), elevated troponin T, positive anti-MPO (P-ANCA) antibodies, and high IgE levels. These findings are suggestive of a systemic process involving eosinophils and vasculitis.

Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome, is characterized by asthma, eosinophilia, and systemic vasculitis. The presence of P-ANCA (anti-MPO) antibodies and the clinical presentation of asthma, eosinophilia, and cardiac involvement (myocarditis leading to heart failure) align with EGPA.

Chagas disease is unlikely as the patient has lived in the United States his entire life and lacks the typical exposure history. Primary dilated cardiomyopathy would not explain the eosinophilia or positive P-ANCA. Extrinsic asthma would not account for the cardiac findings or eosinophilia.

Therefore, the best explanation for the clinical presentation and laboratory findings is EGPA.",9
8455,"The patient has a murmur characteristic of mitral valve prolapse (MVP), which is associated with a mid-systolic click and a late systolic murmur. The timing of the click and murmur in MVP is influenced by changes in venous return and ventricular volume. 

- **Standing** decreases venous return and left ventricular volume, causing the click and murmur to occur earlier.
- **Squatting** increases venous return and left ventricular volume, causing the click and murmur to occur later.
- **Handgrip** increases afterload, which can also delay the click and murmur.
- **Left lateral decubitus position** is used to better hear certain murmurs but does not significantly affect the timing of the click in MVP.

Therefore, standing would most likely cause an earlier onset of the click/murmur in mitral valve prolapse.",9
8456,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with myasthenia gravis, including fluctuating muscle weakness, ptosis, and positive anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies. The electromyography findings further support this diagnosis. In managing myasthenia gravis, it is important to assess for a thymoma, as it is often associated with the condition. A CT scan of the chest is the appropriate next step to evaluate for the presence of a thymoma, which can guide further treatment decisions.",9
8459,"The patient has atrial fibrillation and was started on an anti-arrhythmic drug. The key findings are mild bradycardia and prolongation of the PR and QT intervals. Sotalol is a class III anti-arrhythmic drug that can cause bradycardia and prolongation of the QT interval due to its beta-blocking and potassium channel-blocking effects. Carvedilol and propranolol are beta-blockers that can cause bradycardia and PR interval prolongation but are not typically associated with QT interval prolongation. Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker that can cause bradycardia and PR interval prolongation but not QT interval prolongation. Therefore, the drug most likely used is sotalol.",9
8461,"The clinical presentation suggests hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which is characterized by the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, acute renal failure, and thrombocytopenia. The history of bloody diarrhea following an illness suggests an infection with a Shiga toxin-producing organism, such as E. coli O157:H7, which is a common cause of HUS in children. The presence of conjunctival pallor and jaundice indicates anemia and hemolysis. In microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, such as HUS, the peripheral blood smear typically shows schistocytes, which are fragmented red blood cells resulting from mechanical damage as they pass through small, damaged blood vessels.",9
8465,"The patient is showing signs of hypovolemic shock (tachycardia and hypotension) following a motor vehicle collision, along with a hematoma on the chest wall. In the context of blunt chest trauma, the aortic isthmus is the most commonly injured site due to its fixed position and the shearing forces experienced during rapid deceleration. The other options are less likely to be injured in this scenario: the aortic valve and left main coronary artery are more protected within the heart, and the inferior vena cava is less likely to be affected by blunt chest trauma.",9
8462,"The patient is 28 weeks pregnant and has no available immunization records. During pregnancy, certain vaccines are recommended to protect both the mother and the baby. The Tdap vaccine is recommended during each pregnancy, ideally between 27 and 36 weeks of gestation, to protect the newborn from pertussis. The influenza vaccine is also recommended during pregnancy, regardless of the trimester, to protect against the flu, which can be more severe in pregnant women. Varicella and MMR vaccines are live vaccines and are contraindicated during pregnancy. Hepatitis B vaccine is not routinely recommended during pregnancy unless the mother is at high risk and not previously vaccinated. Therefore, the most appropriate vaccines to administer at this time are Tdap and influenza.",9
8464,"The patient's symptoms suggest a pattern of pervasive distrust and suspiciousness, which are characteristic of paranoid personality disorder. This includes unjustified beliefs that others are deceiving him, holding grudges, and interpreting benign comments as hostile. Paranoid personality disorder is part of the cluster A personality disorders, which are often considered to be on the schizophrenia spectrum. There is a genetic predisposition for schizophrenia in individuals with cluster A personality disorders, particularly paranoid personality disorder. Therefore, the condition this patient is genetically predisposed for is schizophrenia.",9
8466,"The patient's symptoms and clinical presentation suggest acute diverticulitis, characterized by left lower quadrant pain, fever, and a history of constipation. In cases of suspected diverticulitis, a CT scan of the abdomen is the most appropriate diagnostic study. It can confirm the diagnosis by showing inflamed or perforated diverticula and can also rule out other potential causes of the symptoms. Colonoscopy is not recommended in the acute setting due to the risk of perforation. An abdominal ultrasound is less sensitive for diverticulitis, and a barium study is not appropriate in the acute phase.",9
8468,"When data from multiple studies are combined in a pooled analysis, the sample size increases, which generally leads to more precise estimates of effect sizes. This is because larger sample sizes reduce the standard error, leading to narrower confidence intervals. Therefore, the results of a pooled analysis are typically more precise compared to individual studies. While pooling data can help identify patterns and increase statistical power, it does not inherently resolve differences in outcomes between studies or overcome limitations in the quality of the individual studies. Additionally, while pooling data can increase power and potentially reduce type II error, it does not necessarily decrease the likelihood of type I error unless specific statistical adjustments are made.",9
8471,"Airway resistance in the respiratory tree is influenced by the diameter and number of airways. The highest resistance is typically found in the larger airways due to their smaller total cross-sectional area compared to the smaller airways, which are more numerous and have a larger total cross-sectional area. The mainstem bronchi and segmental bronchi have larger diameters but fewer branches compared to the smaller bronchioles. Among the options, the segmental bronchi have a significant contribution to airway resistance due to their relatively larger size and fewer numbers compared to the smaller bronchioles, which are more numerous and contribute less to total resistance.",9
8480,"The patient is being prescribed a drug that activates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha), which is characteristic of fibrates such as gemfibrozil or fenofibrate. Fibrates are used to lower triglyceride levels and can cause muscle-related side effects, especially when used in combination with statins like atorvastatin. The reddish-brown discoloration of urine is indicative of myoglobinuria, which can occur due to rhabdomyolysis, a known adverse effect of fibrates, particularly when combined with statins. This makes option B the most likely adverse effect in this scenario.",9
8476,"The lab findings indicate a metabolic alkalosis (elevated bicarbonate and pH), hypokalemia, and hyponatremia. The increased urinary calcium excretion suggests a renal tubular disorder. The combination of these findings, along with the family history of congenital kidney disorders, points towards Bartter syndrome. Bartter syndrome is characterized by a defect in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, similar to the action of loop diuretics like furosemide. Furosemide inhibits the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter in the thick ascending limb, leading to similar electrolyte disturbances as seen in Bartter syndrome.",9
8483,"The clinical presentation described is characteristic of seborrheic keratosis, which are benign skin lesions that appear as 'stuck on' plaques. These lesions are typically light brown and flat, and they do not cause itching or pain. The sudden appearance of multiple seborrheic keratoses can be associated with an underlying malignancy, a phenomenon known as the Leser-Trélat sign. This sign is most commonly associated with gastric adenocarcinoma. Therefore, the sudden appearance of these lesions in this patient suggests a possible underlying gastric adenocarcinoma.",9
8484,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of hairy cell leukemia, a type of chronic lymphoproliferative disorder. Key findings include pancytopenia (anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia), splenomegaly, and the presence of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity in the peripheral blood smear. The most appropriate initial treatment for hairy cell leukemia is cladribine, a purine analog that is effective in inducing remission in this condition.",9
8485,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), likely emphysema, given the smoking history, cough, dyspnea, and spirometry findings. The FEV1:FVC ratio of 45% indicates obstructive lung disease. The chest x-ray findings of widened intercostal spaces and hyperlucency are consistent with emphysema, which is characterized by destruction of alveolar walls. This destruction is primarily due to an imbalance between proteases and antiproteases, often involving increased activity of neutrophils. Neutrophils release elastase, a protease that breaks down elastin in the alveolar walls, leading to the characteristic changes seen in emphysema. Therefore, increased activity of neutrophils is most likely responsible for this patient's condition.",9
8487,"The patient presents with auditory hallucinations, diaphoresis, and tremors after a history of heavy alcohol use. These symptoms developed 12 hours after his last drink. Alcoholic hallucinosis typically occurs within 12-24 hours after the last drink and is characterized by hallucinations (often auditory) without the autonomic instability or severe confusion seen in delirium tremens. Delirium tremens usually occurs 48-96 hours after the last drink and includes severe autonomic instability and confusion, which are not present here. Cocaine intoxication could cause hallucinations but would more likely present with sympathetic overactivity, which is not described. A brief psychotic disorder is less likely given the context of alcohol withdrawal. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is alcoholic hallucinosis.",9
8489,"The scenario describes a man who likely died from sudden cardiac death due to a 100% blockage of the left anterior descending artery. This suggests an acute myocardial infarction (MI). The timeline indicates that he died 2 days prior to being found. In the context of myocardial infarction, histological changes occur in a predictable sequence. Within the first 24 hours, coagulative necrosis begins, characterized by the uniform binding of acidophilic dyes due to protein denaturation and loss of nuclei. By 1-3 days post-MI, coagulative necrosis is more pronounced, and neutrophilic infiltration begins. However, the presence of cellular debris and macrophages is typically seen later, around 3-7 days post-MI, as macrophages start to clear necrotic tissue. Cystic cavitation and fat saponification are not relevant to myocardial tissue. Therefore, given the timeline of 2 days post-MI, the expected histological finding is uniform binding of acidophilic dyes due to coagulative necrosis.",9
8495,"The patient's symptoms of a painful red tongue, cracked lips, red eyes, photophobia, and dermatitis are suggestive of a vitamin B2 (riboflavin) deficiency. Riboflavin deficiency can lead to angular stomatitis, cheilosis, glossitis, and ocular symptoms such as photophobia and conjunctivitis. The malabsorption history and inability to maintain her diet or take vitamins regularly further support a vitamin deficiency. To diagnose riboflavin deficiency, the most helpful test is the measurement of erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity, as riboflavin is a cofactor for this enzyme. A low activity that increases upon addition of FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide) indicates riboflavin deficiency.",9
8496,"The patient has oral thrush, likely due to the use of inhaled corticosteroids (budesonide). The appropriate treatment for oral thrush is an antifungal medication. Fluconazole is a systemic antifungal that can be used for this purpose. Theophylline, which the patient is taking for COPD, has a narrow therapeutic index and is metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP1A2. Fluconazole is a known inhibitor of CYP enzymes, including CYP1A2, which can lead to increased levels of theophylline. This increase can cause symptoms of theophylline toxicity, such as nausea, palpitations, anxiety, tachycardia, and tremor. Therefore, the symptoms the patient is experiencing are consistent with theophylline toxicity due to an interaction with fluconazole.",9
8499,"The patient presents with jaundice, weight loss, and a palpable gallbladder, which are classic signs of pancreatic cancer, particularly in the head of the pancreas. The elevated direct bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase suggest obstructive jaundice, likely due to a mass compressing the bile duct. The hypoechoic mass in the epigastric region seen on ultrasound further supports this. CA 19-9 is a tumor marker often elevated in pancreatic cancer, making option D the best choice. Options A, B, and C do not accurately describe pancreatic cancer: caffeine is not an established risk factor (A), the majority of pancreatic cancers occur in the head, not the body (B), and while diabetes can be associated, it is not typically rapidly developing (C).",9

8502,"The presentation of a swollen, erythematous, warm, and painful knee in a child following trauma raises the suspicion of septic arthritis, especially given the fever and inability to bear weight. Septic arthritis is a medical emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent joint damage. The best initial step in management is to confirm the diagnosis, which is done by performing an arthrocentesis. This procedure allows for synovial fluid analysis to check for infection, crystals, or other causes of joint effusion. Antibiotics should be started after obtaining synovial fluid for culture to avoid altering the results. Therefore, the best initial step is arthrocentesis.",9
8500,"The patient presents with blurry vision, urinary urgency, discomfort while urinating, weakness, nausea, and signs of dehydration (dry mucous membranes, hypotension, and tachycardia). She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and is on insulin, which suggests she is at risk for diabetic complications. The symptoms of blurry vision and dehydration, along with her history of diabetes, point towards a hyperglycemic state. 

Hypoglycemia (B) is unlikely because it typically presents with symptoms like confusion, sweating, and palpitations, not dehydration or blurry vision. 

Ischemic optic neuropathy (A) would cause sudden vision loss but is not associated with systemic symptoms like nausea or dehydration.

Posterior uveitis (C) would cause eye pain and redness, which are not present here.

Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (D) is characterized by severe hyperglycemia, dehydration, and altered mental status, which aligns with her symptoms of blurry vision, dehydration, and weakness. The urinary symptoms could be due to a urinary tract infection, which is common in diabetic patients and can precipitate hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.",9
8505,"The clinical presentation of recurrent bacterial infections, light-colored skin, and silver hair, along with the finding of large cytoplasmic vacuoles containing microbes within neutrophils, is suggestive of a disorder affecting lysosomal trafficking. Chediak-Higashi syndrome is characterized by partial oculocutaneous albinism (light skin and silver hair) and recurrent infections due to impaired lysosomal trafficking, leading to the presence of large granules in neutrophils. This is due to a defect in the LYST gene, which affects lysosomal fusion. The peripheral blood smear findings of large cytoplasmic vacuoles in neutrophils are consistent with this diagnosis. Other options do not match the combination of symptoms and laboratory findings.",9
8510,"The patient's symptoms and findings suggest a systemic fungal infection. The key details include the presence of intracellular yeast and the specific findings on fungal culture. Histoplasmosis is known for intracellular yeast forms, as Histoplasma capsulatum is often found within macrophages. The culture findings of thick-walled spherical spores with tubercles and microconidia are characteristic of Histoplasma. Additionally, the patient's location in Ohio is consistent with the endemic area for Histoplasmosis, which is prevalent in the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys. Other options like Blastomycosis, Cryptococcosis, and Coccidioidomycosis have different characteristic findings and endemic regions.",9
8512,"In this scenario, the patient has been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and requires insulin therapy. For rapid action during mealtimes, a rapid-acting insulin is needed. Insulin lispro is a rapid-acting insulin that is typically used to control blood sugar spikes during meals. NPH insulin is an intermediate-acting insulin, and insulin glargine is a long-acting insulin, neither of which are suitable for rapid action during meals. NPH and regular insulin can be used together for basal and mealtime coverage, but regular insulin is not as fast-acting as insulin lispro. Therefore, insulin lispro is the best choice for rapid action during mealtimes.",9
8509,"The patient is a 17-year-old boy with proteinuria detected on a routine examination. The proteinuria was initially 3+ on dipstick and is now 1+. He has a history of a recent upper respiratory infection and works at a shooting range, which is relevant for his mild sensorineural hearing loss but not directly related to the proteinuria. His blood pressure and renal function are normal, and there are no signs of systemic illness. The specific gravity of the urine is low, suggesting dilute urine, which can affect protein concentration. The key detail is that the proteinuria was initially detected after a day of work, which could involve prolonged standing. This suggests orthostatic (postural) proteinuria, a benign condition where proteinuria occurs when the patient is upright and resolves when supine. This is common in adolescents and young adults and is not associated with kidney damage. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the proteinuria is standing for long periods of time.",9
8513,"The patient presents with a firm and non-mobile right adnexal mass, which raises suspicion for an ovarian mass, possibly ovarian cancer. In such cases, the initial step is to further characterize the mass. A pelvic ultrasound is the most appropriate initial imaging modality to evaluate an adnexal mass. It helps in determining the size, consistency (solid or cystic), and other characteristics of the mass. While CA-125 can be used as a tumor marker for ovarian cancer, it is not the first step in management. An abdominal MRI is more detailed but not typically the first step. Exploratory laparotomy is a treatment step, not a diagnostic one. Therefore, the next step in management is a pelvic ultrasound.",9
8514,"The patient presents with signs and symptoms consistent with constrictive pericarditis, likely secondary to his history of tuberculosis. Key findings include jugular venous distention, Kussmaul's sign (jugular venous pressure rises with inspiration), low-amplitude QRS complexes, pleural effusions, and calcifications on chest x-ray. The echocardiogram shows a decrease in diastolic flow velocity during inspiration, and cardiac catheterization reveals a dip-and-plateau waveform, both indicative of constrictive pericarditis. The most definitive treatment for constrictive pericarditis, especially when it is chronic and symptomatic, is surgical pericardiectomy to remove the thickened pericardium and relieve the constriction on the heart.",9
8517,"The patient presents with symptoms and history suggestive of a specific occupational lung disease. He has a history of working in ship dry-docks, which is a known risk factor for asbestos exposure. The symptoms include gradually worsening shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, and bilateral crackles at the lung bases. The chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates at the lung bases, and the CT scan reveals pleural scarring. Pulmonary function tests show a restrictive pattern with a slightly increased FEV1/FVC ratio and decreased total lung volume, which is consistent with interstitial lung disease. Asbestosis is characterized by interstitial fibrosis and pleural plaques due to asbestos exposure, which aligns with the patient's occupational history and imaging findings. Drug-induced interstitial lung disease is less likely given the short duration of amlodipine use. Sarcoidosis typically presents with hilar lymphadenopathy and is less associated with pleural scarring. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis usually presents with asthma and central bronchiectasis, which are not described here.",9
8518,"The patient's symptoms of progressive weakness, difficulty walking, and decreased reflexes with intact sensation suggest a peripheral neuropathy, specifically Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). GBS is often preceded by an infection, such as the nausea and vomiting he experienced a few weeks prior. In GBS, a lumbar puncture typically shows an albuminocytologic dissociation, which is characterized by elevated protein levels with a normal cell count. This is due to increased permeability of the blood-nerve barrier, leading to elevated protein without an increase in white blood cells.",9
8522,"The patient's symptoms and findings are suggestive of celiac disease. She has fatigue, abdominal bloating, diarrhea, weight loss, and a pruritic rash on her knees, which is likely dermatitis herpetiformis, a skin manifestation associated with celiac disease. The anemia with low mean corpuscular volume suggests iron deficiency, common in celiac disease due to malabsorption. The most specific test for celiac disease is the presence of IgA tissue transglutaminase antibodies.",9
8523,"Patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations have a significantly increased risk of breast cancer. The best screening approach for these high-risk individuals includes more frequent and sensitive screening methods. Twice-yearly clinical breast exams allow for more frequent monitoring by a healthcare professional. Annual mammography is standard, but adding an annual breast MRI is crucial because MRI is more sensitive than mammography in detecting breast cancer, especially in younger women with dense breast tissue. Monthly self-breast exams are also recommended to help the patient become familiar with her own breast tissue and notice any changes. Therefore, the most comprehensive and appropriate screening strategy for someone with a BRCA mutation is option B.",9
8529,"The patient's presentation is consistent with an acute inflammatory arthritis. The key findings include severe pain and swelling of the proximal interphalangeal joint, elevated white blood cell count, elevated ESR, and synovial fluid analysis showing negatively birefringent needle-shaped crystals. These crystals are characteristic of monosodium urate crystals, which are seen in gout. The acute onset of symptoms, especially after alcohol consumption, aligns with an acute gout attack. Septic arthritis is less likely due to the negative culture and the presence of crystals. Chronic gout would present with tophi and a history of recurrent attacks. Reactive arthritis typically follows an infection and does not present with urate crystals. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is acute gout.",9
8530,"The clinical presentation and genetic findings in this case are suggestive of Williams syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by a deletion on the long arm of chromosome 7, specifically at 7q11.23. Patients with Williams syndrome often have distinctive facial features, intellectual disability, and cardiovascular problems. One of the hallmark cardiovascular findings in Williams syndrome is supravalvular aortic stenosis. The other options listed are associated with different conditions: hand flapping movements are often seen in autism spectrum disorders, Brushfield spots are associated with Down syndrome, and testicular enlargement can be seen in conditions like Fragile X syndrome. Therefore, the most likely additional finding in this patient with a deletion on chromosome 7 is supravalvular aortic stenosis.",9
8533,"The patient presents with joint pain and stiffness in the wrists and fingers, which improves as the day progresses. This pattern, along with the involvement of the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints, is suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is characterized by morning stiffness that improves with activity. The presence of warm and edematous joints further supports this diagnosis. 

In RA, the most specific antibodies are anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPAs), which are directed against citrullinated peptides. These antibodies are more specific for RA than rheumatoid factor, which targets the Fc region of IgG (option A). 

Options C and D are associated with other conditions: anti-topoisomerase I antibodies are associated with scleroderma, and anti-centromere antibodies are associated with limited scleroderma (CREST syndrome). 

Therefore, the most specific antibodies for this patient's condition, which is likely rheumatoid arthritis, are directed against citrullinated peptides.",9
8482,,0
8535,"The question involves understanding which sulfur-containing amino acid is excised by the N-terminal peptidase. The two sulfur-containing amino acids are methionine and cysteine. Methionine is the amino acid that is typically removed by N-terminal peptidase after translation initiation. Methionine is coded by the start codon AUG, which means the anticodon on the tRNA that carries methionine is 5'-CAU-3'. Therefore, the anticodon sequence of the tRNA charged with methionine, which is the target of the N-terminal peptidase, is 5'-CAU-3'.",9
8538,"The patient presents with symptoms of urethritis, including pain upon urination and a watery discharge. The Gram stain of the discharge is negative for bacteria but shows many neutrophils, indicating an inflammatory response. This suggests a non-gonococcal urethritis, as Neisseria gonorrhoeae would typically show gram-negative diplococci on Gram stain. 

Chlamydia trachomatis is a common cause of non-gonococcal urethritis and does not appear on Gram stain because it is an intracellular organism that lacks a peptidoglycan cell wall, making it not visible with this staining method. 

Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus saprophyticus are typically associated with urinary tract infections rather than urethritis and would be visible on Gram stain. Trichomonas vaginalis is a protozoan and would not be detected on a Gram stain, but it is less commonly associated with male urethritis compared to Chlamydia.

Therefore, the most likely infectious etiology given the negative Gram stain and the presence of neutrophils is Chlamydia trachomatis.",9
8539,"The symptoms described in the vignette are highly suggestive of an Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm) infection. The key points are the intense itching around the anus and groin, particularly at night, which is characteristic of pinworm infections. The female worms lay eggs around the anus at night, causing the itching. The recent history of diarrhea and antibiotic use is less relevant to the current symptoms, as they are more indicative of a pinworm infection rather than a bacterial or protozoal cause. Gardnerella vaginalis typically causes bacterial vaginosis, which presents with a different set of symptoms, and Giardia lamblia is associated with gastrointestinal symptoms rather than perianal itching. Herpes simplex virus would present with painful vesicular lesions, not just itching. Therefore, the most likely infectious etiology is Enterobius vermicularis.",9
8507,"The patient is experiencing symptoms consistent with serotonin syndrome, which can occur when there is an excess of serotonin in the central nervous system. This is characterized by fever, agitation, hypertonia, and clonus. Given the patient's recent prescription for nausea, the drug likely contributed to increased serotonin activity. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, such as ondansetron, are commonly used to treat chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Although they block serotonin receptors, they can still contribute to serotonin syndrome, especially when combined with other serotonergic drugs like sertraline, which the patient is already taking. The other options (D2, H1, and M1 receptor antagonists) are not typically associated with serotonin syndrome. Therefore, the most likely mechanism of action of the drug that led to serotonin syndrome in this patient is 5-HT3 receptor antagonism.",9
8545,The scenario describes a situation where the computer scientist redirects his frustration from receiving negative feedback from his senior associate to his intern. This redirection of emotions from a threatening target (senior associate) to a less threatening one (intern) is characteristic of displacement. Displacement involves shifting emotions or reactions from the original source of distress to a safer or more acceptable target.,9
8550,"The patient's symptoms and findings are suggestive of Crohn's disease, which is associated with mutations in the NOD2 gene. NOD2 is involved in the recognition of bacterial components and plays a role in the immune response. Dysfunction of NOD2 leads to an inappropriate immune response, particularly involving the NF-κB pathway. Normally, NOD2 helps regulate NF-κB activity, and mutations can lead to its overactivation, resulting in increased inflammation. Therefore, the dysfunction of NOD2 in this patient is most likely causing overactivity of NF-κB.",9
8541,"To calculate the relative risk (RR) of developing cardiomyopathy with the drug, we need to determine the incidence of cardiomyopathy in both the exposed and unexposed groups.

1. **Incidence in the exposed group:**
   - Number of mice with cardiomyopathy = 13
   - Total number of exposed mice = 52
   - Incidence in exposed group = 13/52

2. **Incidence in the unexposed group:**
   - Number of mice with cardiomyopathy = 1
   - Total number of unexposed mice = 50
   - Incidence in unexposed group = 1/50

3. **Relative Risk (RR):**
   - RR = (Incidence in exposed group) / (Incidence in unexposed group)
   - RR = (13/52) / (1/50)
   - RR = (13/52) * (50/1)
   - RR = 13 * 50 / 52
   - RR = 650 / 52
   - RR = 12.5

Therefore, the relative risk of developing cardiomyopathy with this drug is 12.5.",10
8543,"The patient's symptoms and the angiogram findings suggest a case of coronary vasospasm, possibly related to Prinzmetal's angina. During the norepinephrine challenge, the initial decrease in blood flow is likely due to vasoconstriction. However, the subsequent increase in blood flow suggests a compensatory vasodilation mechanism. Adenosine is a potent vasodilator that is released in response to ischemia or hypoxia, and it acts to increase coronary blood flow. This makes adenosine the most likely substance responsible for the increased blood flow observed after the initial vasoconstriction.",9
8561,"The patient's symptoms of foul-smelling diarrhea, fatigue, bloating, weight loss, and anemia suggest malabsorption. The presence of conjunctival pallor and inflammation of the corners of the mouth indicates possible nutritional deficiencies. The key detail is the intestinal biopsy, which likely shows villous atrophy, a hallmark of celiac disease. Celiac disease is an autoimmune condition triggered by gluten, found in certain cereal grains. Avoidance of gluten-containing grains would improve the patient's symptoms.",9
8558,"The patient has a CD4+ count of 33 cells/mm3, which places him at high risk for opportunistic infections. At this level, prophylaxis is needed for both Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is used for PCP prophylaxis when the CD4+ count is below 200 cells/mm3. Azithromycin is used for MAC prophylaxis when the CD4+ count is below 50 cells/mm3. Fluconazole is not routinely used for prophylaxis unless there is a specific indication such as recurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis. Therefore, the correct combination for this patient is azithromycin for MAC and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for PCP.",9
8519,,0
8563,"The patient's symptoms and findings suggest a diagnosis of Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA), formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis. This condition is characterized by a triad of upper respiratory tract involvement (nasal ulceration and septal perforation), lower respiratory tract involvement (cavitating lung lesions), and renal involvement (glomerulonephritis with RBC casts). The presence of palpable purpura and systemic symptoms like fever further support this diagnosis. GPA is associated with elevated c-ANCA (cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) titers, specifically targeting proteinase 3. The other options do not fit the clinical picture: anti-Smith antibodies are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, elevated serum IgA is associated with IgA nephropathy, and a positive tuberculin test indicates tuberculosis exposure.",9
8564,"To maximize the chances of successful reattachment of an amputated digit, it is crucial to preserve the tissue properly. The best method involves keeping the digit cool and moist, but not in direct contact with ice or water, which can cause tissue damage. The correct procedure is to wrap the digit in saline-moistened gauze, place it in a sterile plastic bag, and then place that bag on ice. This method keeps the digit cool without freezing it, which helps preserve the tissue until surgical reattachment can occur.",9
8551,"The patient presents with jaundice, right upper quadrant pain, fatigue, and pruritus, along with a history of ulcerative colitis. The lab findings show elevated bilirubin, AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase levels, with a significantly higher ALT compared to AST, suggesting a hepatocellular pattern of liver injury. The presence of p-ANCA positivity is particularly suggestive of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), especially in the context of ulcerative colitis. PSC is commonly associated with inflammatory bowel disease, particularly ulcerative colitis, and can present with cholestatic liver enzyme abnormalities and p-ANCA positivity. Hepatitis E and A are less likely given the vaccination status and lack of travel history. Primary biliary cirrhosis (now known as primary biliary cholangitis) is more common in women and is associated with anti-mitochondrial antibodies, not p-ANCA.",9
8566,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest a bleeding disorder. The prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) with normal bleeding time indicate a defect in the common pathway or multiple factors in the coagulation cascade. The history of immunodeficiency and long courses of antibiotics suggests a possible vitamin K deficiency, which affects factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as proteins C and S. Among the options, Protein C is a vitamin K-dependent protein involved in anticoagulation. The prolonged PT and PTT with normal bleeding time align with a deficiency in vitamin K-dependent factors, affecting Protein C activity.",9
8562,"The patient presents with dysphagia that has progressed from solids to liquids, retrosternal burning, and symptoms suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), such as burning when lying down. The weight loss and smoking history also raise concern for possible complications like esophagitis or Barrett's esophagus. While a barium swallow can help visualize structural abnormalities and manometry can assess motility disorders, the presence of alarm symptoms (progressive dysphagia and weight loss) necessitates direct visualization to rule out malignancy or severe esophagitis. Therefore, endoscopy is the most appropriate next step to evaluate the esophagus directly and obtain biopsies if needed.",9
8572,"The patient's presentation suggests an infection acquired from handling oysters, which is commonly associated with Vibrio species, particularly Vibrio vulnificus. This organism is known to cause wound infections after exposure to seawater or handling seafood like oysters. Vibrio vulnificus is a Gram-negative bacterium that is a facultative anaerobe, meaning it can grow in both the presence and absence of oxygen. The description of the lesion and the context of oyster handling strongly point towards this organism.",9
8567,"The question involves identifying a condition based on a Pap smear finding. The patient's history includes risk factors such as multiple sexual partners and smoking, which are relevant to sexually transmitted infections and cervical changes. The key to answering this question is understanding the cytological changes associated with each condition.

- **Trichomoniasis**: This condition is caused by the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis. On a Pap smear, it may show inflammatory changes and the presence of the organism itself, but not specific cellular changes like koilocytosis.

- **Condylomata acuminata**: These are genital warts caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly types 6 and 11. HPV infection can lead to koilocytic changes in cervical cells, which are characterized by perinuclear halos and nuclear atypia.

- **Syphilitic chancre**: This is a primary lesion of syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum. It does not cause specific cytological changes on a Pap smear.

- **Bacterial vaginosis**: This condition is characterized by a shift in vaginal flora and the presence of clue cells, which are vaginal epithelial cells covered with bacteria. It does not cause koilocytic changes.

Given the context and the typical Pap smear findings associated with each condition, the presence of cells with koilocytic changes (perinuclear halos and nuclear atypia) is most consistent with HPV infection, which is related to condylomata acuminata.",9
8569,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune thyroid disorder. The elevated TSH and low T4, along with positive anti-thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies, support this diagnosis. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is associated with an increased risk of developing thyroid lymphoma in the future due to chronic lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid gland. Papillary carcinoma is more commonly associated with radiation exposure, not directly with Hashimoto's. Parathyroid adenoma and subacute thyroiditis are not directly related to Hashimoto's thyroiditis.",9
8578,"The clinical presentation of the child is highly suggestive of measles. The key features include a history of cough, runny nose, high fever, and a progressive maculopapular rash that started on the face and spread to the body. Additionally, the child is from the Philippines, where measles might be more prevalent, and there is no available immunization record, increasing the likelihood of measles. To confirm the diagnosis of measles, the most appropriate test is the detection of measles-specific IgM antibodies in the blood, which indicates a recent measles infection.",9
8579,"The scenario describes a process where bacteriophages transfer genetic material, including toxin genes, from one bacterium to another. This process is known as transduction. In the context of bacterial pathogenicity, this is particularly relevant to Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The bacterium becomes pathogenic when it acquires the diphtheria toxin gene via a bacteriophage. This is a classic example of lysogenic conversion, where a nonpathogenic strain becomes pathogenic due to the acquisition of a toxin gene from a bacteriophage.",9
8576,"The patient is a 27-year-old woman at 32 weeks' gestation presenting with swollen legs, mild shortness of breath, and generalized fatigue. Her vital signs are within normal limits for pregnancy, and she has 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities. The presence of an S3 gallop can be normal in pregnancy due to increased blood volume and cardiac output. The absence of erythema or tenderness in the legs makes deep vein thrombosis less likely, and the clear lung auscultation reduces the likelihood of pulmonary embolism. The symptoms described are common in pregnancy due to physiological changes, including increased blood volume and pressure from the gravid uterus on the inferior vena cava, leading to edema. Therefore, reassurance and monitoring are appropriate as these symptoms are typical in pregnancy and do not indicate a pathological condition.",9
8575,"The child's physical features and the low amniotic fluid index suggest a condition known as Potter sequence. Potter sequence is characterized by a specific set of physical features due to oligohydramnios (low amniotic fluid). The oligohydramnios is often caused by bilateral renal agenesis, where the kidneys fail to develop, leading to insufficient urine production and thus low amniotic fluid. The features described, such as low-set ears, receding chin, and clubbed feet, are consistent with this condition. The ultrasound finding of an amniotic fluid index of 3 cm indicates severe oligohydramnios, supporting the diagnosis of Potter sequence due to bilateral renal agenesis.",9
8581,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with urge incontinence, characterized by a sudden and intense urge to urinate followed by involuntary leakage. This condition is often due to overactivity of the detrusor muscle in the bladder. The most common pharmacological treatment for urge incontinence involves the use of antimuscarinic agents, which work by antagonizing muscarinic receptors, particularly the M3 subtype, on the bladder's detrusor muscle. This reduces involuntary contractions and helps manage symptoms. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is a drug that antagonizes muscarinic M3 receptors.",9
8583,"The patient's symptoms and presentation suggest an atypical pneumonia, given the nonproductive cough, fever, and systemic symptoms like headache, fatigue, and myalgias. The skin lesions described are consistent with erythema multiforme, which can be associated with certain infections. The clear lungs on auscultation and the systemic symptoms point towards an atypical organism. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of atypical pneumonia and is known to be associated with erythema multiforme. The other organisms listed typically cause more typical presentations of pneumonia with productive cough and more pronounced lung findings on examination.",9
8587,"The clinical presentation suggests a hereditary nephritis, likely Alport syndrome, given the combination of hearing impairment and renal findings. Alport syndrome is characterized by mutations affecting type IV collagen, leading to abnormalities in the basement membranes of the kidneys, ears, and eyes. The urinalysis shows significant proteinuria and hematuria, which are consistent with glomerular disease. The key histological finding in Alport syndrome is the ""basket-weave"" appearance of the glomerular basement membrane on electron microscopy, due to irregular thickening and lamellation. Other options do not fit the presentation: crescentic glomerulonephritis (option B) would present with rapidly progressive renal failure; nodular lesions (option C) are seen in diabetic nephropathy; and the ""tram-track"" appearance (option D) is associated with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.",9
8591,"The patient is immunocompromised due to a history of lung transplantation and presents with symptoms suggestive of meningitis, such as headache, vomiting, fever, and confusion. The presence of oral thrush indicates a possible fungal infection, which is common in immunocompromised individuals. Cryptococcal meningitis is a common fungal infection in such patients. In cryptococcal meningitis, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis typically shows an increased opening pressure, increased lymphocyte count, elevated protein, and decreased glucose levels. The CSF may appear cloudy due to the presence of organisms and cells.",9
8590,"The patient presents with signs of respiratory distress, hypotension, and an impact wound in the left fourth intercostal space. The tracheal deviation to the right and absent breath sounds over the left lung suggest a significant issue on the left side of the chest. The dullness to percussion over the left chest indicates the presence of fluid rather than air, which would cause hyperresonance. The flat neck veins suggest that there is no significant venous pressure increase, which would be expected in tension pneumothorax or cardiac tamponade. The combination of these findings—dullness to percussion, absent breath sounds, and hypotension—points towards a hemothorax, where blood accumulates in the pleural space, causing lung collapse and mediastinal shift.",9
8584,"The child initially received rattlesnake antivenom, which is known to potentially cause serum sickness. Serum sickness is a type III hypersensitivity reaction that occurs when there is deposition of antibody-antigen complexes in tissues, leading to inflammation and symptoms such as fever, rash, and joint pain. This typically occurs days to weeks after exposure to the antigen, which aligns with the child's presentation 6 days after receiving the antivenom. Therefore, the symptoms are due to antibody-antigen complex deposition.",9
8593,"The patient presents with abdominal pain radiating to the back, fever, nausea, vomiting, and a history of alcoholism. The elevated amylase level suggests pancreatitis. The presence of fever, elevated WBC count, and elevated bilirubin could indicate an infection or obstruction. Gallstone pancreatitis is a likely diagnosis given the elevated bilirubin and amylase levels, suggesting that a gallstone may have caused pancreatitis. Ascending cholangitis typically presents with Charcot's triad (fever, jaundice, right upper quadrant pain), but the pain radiating to the back and the very high amylase level are more indicative of pancreatitis. Choledocholithiasis involves common bile duct stones and may cause elevated bilirubin, but the amylase level is not typically as high as seen in pancreatitis. Cholelithiasis usually does not cause such severe symptoms or elevated amylase. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is gallstone pancreatitis.",9
8597,"In this case, the patient has hypertension, asthma, and slightly elevated creatinine and potassium levels. When selecting an antihypertensive medication, we need to consider these factors:

- **Asthma:** Beta-blockers, especially non-selective ones like propranolol, can exacerbate asthma symptoms by causing bronchoconstriction. Therefore, propranolol (B) is not appropriate.

- **Elevated creatinine and potassium:** Spironolactone (D) is a potassium-sparing diuretic and can further increase potassium levels, which is not suitable given the patient's already elevated potassium.

- **Hydrochlorothiazide (C):** While thiazide diuretics can be used in hypertension, they can potentially worsen kidney function and electrolyte imbalances, especially in patients with already elevated creatinine and potassium.

- **Amlodipine (A):** This is a calcium channel blocker that does not affect potassium levels and is generally safe for patients with asthma. It does not have significant renal side effects and is effective in managing hypertension.

Considering all these factors, amlodipine is the most appropriate choice.",10
8595,"The patient initially presented with symptoms and ECG findings consistent with an acute myocardial infarction (MI). Four days after hospitalization, he develops altered mental status, hypotension, jugular venous distention, pulsus paradoxus, and distant heart sounds. These findings are classic for cardiac tamponade, which is caused by the accumulation of fluid or blood in the pericardial space, leading to compression of the heart chambers. This is a known complication following an MI, particularly due to free wall rupture, which can lead to hemopericardium and tamponade. The sudden drop in blood pressure and the triad of symptoms (Beck's triad: hypotension, jugular venous distention, and muffled heart sounds) strongly suggest cardiac tamponade.",9
8598,"The clinical presentation of the 5-year-old girl suggests a chronic conjunctivitis with specific findings. The key features include watery discharge, matting of the eyelashes, hyperemia, follicles, and papillae on the upper tarsal conjunctiva, as well as corneal haziness with neovascularization. Additionally, there is pre-auricular lymphadenopathy. These findings are characteristic of trachoma, which is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Trachoma is endemic in certain regions, including parts of Africa, and the patient's background as a refugee from Sudan supports this diagnosis. The presence of follicles and papillae, along with corneal involvement and lymphadenopathy, aligns with trachoma rather than the other options.",9
8599,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of type 2 diabetes mellitus, as indicated by the elevated hemoglobin A1c of 8.5%. Type 2 diabetes is often associated with obesity, which is reflected in this patient's high BMI of 33 kg/m2. Obesity is a major risk factor for insulin resistance, which is a key component in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. While alcohol consumption and smoking can contribute to various health issues, they are not primary predisposing factors for type 2 diabetes. HLA-DR4 is associated with type 1 diabetes, not type 2. Therefore, the most likely predisposing factor for this patient's condition is a high calorie diet leading to obesity.",9
8608,"The patient is presenting with symptoms of meningitis, including fever, headache, confusion, and nuchal rigidity. The cerebrospinal fluid culture shows a gram-positive bacillus with a narrow transparent rim, which is characteristic of Listeria monocytogenes. Listeria is a common cause of meningitis in immunocompromised individuals, such as those who have undergone organ transplantation. The antibiotic of choice for treating Listeria infections is ampicillin, often in combination with gentamicin for synergy. Therefore, the most effective antibiotic for this patient's condition is ampicillin.",9
8589,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with amphetamine toxicity, including agitation, dilated pupils, diaphoresis, and hyperthermia. Amphetamines can lead to life-threatening complications such as hyperthermia, seizures, and cardiovascular issues. Malignant hyperthermia is typically associated with certain anesthetics, not amphetamines. Respiratory depression is more commonly associated with opioid overdose. Amphetamines can cause seizures, but the most immediate life-threatening complication is sudden cardiac arrest due to the sympathomimetic effects leading to hypertension, tachycardia, and potential arrhythmias.",9
8622,"The patient's symptoms include confusion, irritability, myoclonus (twitching when startled), and ataxia, which are suggestive of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). CJD is a prion disease characterized by rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus, and ataxia. On brain autopsy, CJD is associated with spongiform changes and accumulations of prion proteins, which are misfolded proteins forming beta-pleated sheets. These prion proteins are resistant to proteases and lead to the characteristic spongiform degeneration seen in the brain tissue of affected individuals.",9
8629,"The patient presents with signs of a postoperative infection, likely pneumonia, given the productive cough, fever, and pleural effusion on chest X-ray. The leukocytosis and elevated temperature support an infectious process. The decreased breath sounds over the right lung base and the pleural effusion suggest a possible bacterial pneumonia, which is common in postoperative patients. Given the patient's fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and tachypnea, she may be developing sepsis. The most immediate concern is to address the potential infection with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Therefore, the next best step in management is to start empirical antibiotic therapy to cover common pathogens, especially in a hospital setting. Intravenous vancomycin and cefepime provide broad coverage for both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including MRSA and Pseudomonas, which are important considerations in a hospital-acquired infection.",9
8630,"The patient presents with depigmented patches on the skin that fluoresce blue-white under Wood's lamp, which is characteristic of vitiligo. Vitiligo is an autoimmune condition where melanocytes are destroyed, leading to depigmented patches. The key feature of vitiligo is the absence of melanocytes in the affected areas, not just a decrease in pigment with normal melanocyte count. The presence of anti-TPO antibodies is associated with autoimmune thyroid disease, which is commonly associated with vitiligo. Therefore, the most likely finding associated with this patient's diagnosis is elevated anti-TPO antibody levels.",9
8632,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs of heart failure, including shortness of breath, lower extremity swelling, and jugular venous distension. The echocardiogram shows a reduced ejection fraction and moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. The history of myocardial infarction and the presence of a holosystolic murmur suggest left-sided heart failure leading to right-sided heart failure. The jugular venous distension and peripheral edema indicate right-sided heart failure, likely due to left-sided heart failure causing pulmonary hypertension and subsequent right ventricular dilatation. This dilatation can lead to functional tricuspid regurgitation. Therefore, the mechanism is right-ventricular dilatation with subsequent functional tricuspid valve dysfunction.",9
8631,"The patient presents with diffuse weakness and an anterior mediastinal mass. These findings are suggestive of a thymoma, which is often associated with myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is characterized by the presence of acetylcholine receptor antibodies. The other options are less likely: elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein is associated with germ cell tumors, elevated TSH with a thyroid mass suggests a thyroid issue, and increased urinary catecholamines are associated with pheochromocytoma, which typically presents with hypertension and other symptoms not described here.",9
8633,"The patient has gestational diabetes, as indicated by the elevated glucose levels on both the 1-hour glucose challenge and the 100-g oral glucose tolerance test. In gestational diabetes, the fetus is exposed to higher glucose levels, which can lead to fetal hyperinsulinemia. This hyperinsulinemia can cause islet cell hyperplasia in the fetus, leading to increased insulin production. After birth, when the maternal glucose supply is removed, the infant can experience hypoglycemia due to the continued high insulin levels. This is the most common complication associated with untreated gestational diabetes. Other options like decreased amniotic fluid production, omphalocele, and decreased hematocrit are not directly related to the effects of gestational diabetes on the fetus.",9
8638,"The patient presents with symptoms and findings suggestive of a fungal infection. He is a farmer in southern Arizona, which is a key geographic clue. The symptoms include a productive cough, shortness of breath, low-grade fever, and skin lesions with a characteristic appearance. The chest x-ray shows left basilar consolidation and left hilar lymphadenopathy. These findings, along with the geographic location, strongly suggest Coccidioidomycosis, also known as Valley Fever, caused by Coccidioides immitis. This fungus is endemic to the southwestern United States, including Arizona. The skin lesions and pulmonary findings are consistent with disseminated Coccidioidomycosis.",9
8637,"The patient has a positive VDRL test, which is a non-treponemal test used for syphilis screening. However, non-treponemal tests can have false positives, so a confirmatory treponemal test is needed to establish the diagnosis of syphilis. The T. pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA) is a treponemal test that can confirm the presence of syphilis infection. The other options are related to hepatitis B, which is not indicated here as the patient has immunity to hepatitis B (Anti-HBsAg positive) and no active infection (HBsAg negative). Therefore, the next step is to confirm the syphilis diagnosis with a treponemal test.",9
8641,"The patient has systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and was likely started on a medication such as glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) as part of her treatment. The development of proximal muscle weakness with normal creatine kinase levels and normal deep tendon reflexes suggests steroid-induced myopathy. This condition is a known adverse effect of long-term glucocorticoid use, characterized by muscle weakness, particularly in the proximal muscles, without significant muscle enzyme elevation. Other options such as autoantibodies against acetylcholine receptors (myasthenia gravis) or myelin (multiple sclerosis) would present differently and are less likely given the context of SLE treatment. Upper and lower motor neuron degeneration would suggest a condition like ALS, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation or history.",9
8639,"The patient presents with swelling and erythema of the right index finger, along with puncture wounds, suggesting a possible animal bite. Given that she has a dog and a cat, and the location of the wound, it is likely a cat bite. Cat bites are often associated with Pasteurella multocida, a bacterium that can cause infection. The most appropriate antibiotic for treating infections from cat bites is amoxicillin–clavulanate, as it covers Pasteurella multocida and other potential pathogens. Amoxicillin alone would not be sufficient because it does not cover beta-lactamase producing organisms. Clindamycin and azithromycin are not first-line treatments for animal bites. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment choice is amoxicillin–clavulanate.",9
8600,"The transtheoretical model of behavior change outlines stages that individuals go through when changing a behavior. These stages include:

1. **Precontemplation:** The individual is not considering change and is unaware of the need to change.
2. **Contemplation:** The individual is aware of the need to change and is considering taking action but has not yet committed.
3. **Preparation:** The individual is planning to take action soon and may begin taking small steps.
4. **Action:** The individual actively changes their behavior.
5. **Maintenance:** The individual has successfully sustained the behavior change over time.

In this scenario, the patient has stopped smoking for the last six months and has implemented alternative stress management strategies (wellness sessions and meditation). The key point is the duration of time he has maintained this behavior change. The 'Action' stage involves actively changing behavior but typically lasts from a few weeks to six months. Once the individual has maintained the behavior change for more than six months, they are considered to be in the 'Maintenance' stage.

Since the patient has sustained his smoking cessation for six months, he is most likely in the 'Maintenance' stage.",9
8640,"The patient is experiencing symptoms consistent with hypocalcemia, which is likely due to hypoparathyroidism following thyroidectomy. The parathyroid glands, which regulate calcium levels, may have been inadvertently removed or damaged during surgery. The hormone responsible for regulating calcium levels is parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH acts through the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathway to increase calcium levels in the blood by acting on bones, kidneys, and the intestines. Therefore, the deficient hormone in this scenario is PTH, and its signaling pathway is cAMP.",9
8647,"The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are suggestive of heart failure, likely due to left-sided heart failure leading to pulmonary congestion and right-sided heart failure signs like jugular venous distention and peripheral edema. The orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea are classic for left-sided heart failure. In heart failure, especially with reduced ejection fraction, an S3 heart sound is often heard. This is an extra heart sound in early diastole, caused by rapid filling of a dilated ventricle. Therefore, the most likely abnormal sound in this patient is an S3, which corresponds to an extra heart sound in early diastole.",9
8648,"The patient presents with signs and symptoms suggestive of Cushing's syndrome, including obesity, abdominal striae, and weakness. The laboratory findings show elevated 24-hour urinary cortisol and serum cortisol levels, confirming hypercortisolism. The high-dose dexamethasone suppression test shows partial suppression of cortisol levels and a decrease in ACTH, suggesting a pituitary source (Cushing's disease) rather than an ectopic ACTH-producing tumor or adrenal tumor. In Cushing's disease, the pituitary adenoma secretes ACTH, leading to increased cortisol production by the adrenal glands. The partial suppression with high-dose dexamethasone is characteristic of a pituitary adenoma. Therefore, the next best step is to perform an MRI of the pituitary gland to identify a possible adenoma.",9
8654,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), including chest pain, sweating, and elevated blood pressure and heart rate. He has significant risk factors for coronary artery disease and recently underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which increases the risk of stent thrombosis or restenosis. In the context of ACS, the most immediate concern is to assess for myocardial infarction. While ECG is already ordered, cardiac biomarkers are crucial for diagnosis. Creatine kinase-muscle/brain (CK-MB) is a specific marker for myocardial injury and can help confirm the diagnosis of myocardial infarction. Myoglobin is less specific and rises earlier, but CK-MB is more commonly used in this context. Angiography is more invasive and typically follows confirmation of myocardial infarction or if there is a need for urgent intervention. Stress testing is not appropriate in the acute setting. Therefore, the best next step in management is to measure CK-MB.",9
8592,,0
8660,"The child presents with symptoms consistent with dehydration due to severe diarrhea, fever, and vomiting. The cool extremities and delayed capillary refill suggest hypovolemia. In infants, dehydration often leads to a sunken anterior fontanelle due to decreased intracranial pressure from fluid loss. Increased serum bicarbonate levels are unlikely because diarrhea typically causes a loss of bicarbonate, leading to metabolic acidosis. Retinal hemorrhages are more associated with trauma or abusive head trauma, which is not indicated here. Kussmaul breathing is a compensatory mechanism for metabolic acidosis, but it is more pronounced in severe cases and not the most direct finding in this scenario. Therefore, the most likely finding in this dehydrated child is a sunken anterior fontanelle.",9
8657,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are suggestive of giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis). She has transient vision loss, headaches, jaw claudication, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Giant cell arteritis is an inflammatory condition affecting large and medium-sized arteries, particularly the temporal arteries. One of the most feared complications of untreated giant cell arteritis is permanent vision loss due to anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. However, the question asks about the greatest risk of developing a complication, and in the context of giant cell arteritis, the most significant vascular complication is the development of a thoracic aortic aneurysm. This occurs due to the involvement of the aorta and its branches, leading to weakening of the vessel wall and potential aneurysm formation.",9
8665,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with psoriatic arthritis, which is associated with psoriasis. The key features include joint pain, morning stiffness, swelling, and nail pitting. Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory arthritis that involves the immune system. The pathogenesis involves the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-alpha, which leads to inflammation and joint damage. The activation of the RANKL pathway is also involved in bone resorption and joint destruction. This is distinct from other causes such as infection, repetitive injury, or crystal deposition, which are not consistent with the clinical presentation of psoriatic arthritis.",9
8672,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a diagnosis of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1), also known as Wermer's syndrome. MEN 1 is characterized by the triad of pituitary tumors, pancreatic endocrine tumors, and hyperparathyroidism. The patient's history of peptic ulcers and the presence of hypercalcemia (elevated calcium level) and hypophosphatemia (low phosphorus level) suggest hyperparathyroidism, which is common in MEN 1. The family history of kidney stones also supports this, as hyperparathyroidism can lead to hypercalcemia and nephrolithiasis. The presence of small ulcers in the stomach and duodenum could be due to a gastrinoma, another component of MEN 1. Therefore, the additional evaluation is most likely to reveal a pituitary adenoma, which is part of the MEN 1 syndrome.",9
8669,"The power of a statistical test is defined as 1 minus the probability of a Type 2 error (β). The probability of a Type 2 error is given as 15%, or 0.15. Therefore, the power of the study is calculated as 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.",10
8680,"The patient is experiencing postpartum hemorrhage, likely due to uterine atony, as indicated by the soft and enlarged uterine fundus. The placenta was delivered intact, ruling out retained placental fragments. The next best step in managing uterine atony is to perform uterine massage to stimulate uterine contraction and administer oxytocin to promote uterine contraction and reduce bleeding. Misoprostol can be used for uterine atony but is not the first-line treatment when oxytocin is available. Uterine artery embolization is a more invasive procedure and is not the immediate next step in this acute setting.",9
8679,"The patient's symptoms are characteristic of Parkinson's disease, which includes a resting tremor, bradykinesia (slowness of movement), rigidity, and postural instability. The 'pill-rolling' tremor, expressionless face, and shuffling gait further support this diagnosis. The most effective treatment for Parkinson's disease, especially in older patients, is levodopa combined with carbidopa. Levodopa is a precursor to dopamine and helps replenish the deficient dopamine in the brain, while carbidopa prevents the peripheral conversion of levodopa to dopamine, allowing more to reach the brain and reducing side effects. Other options like bromocriptine (a dopamine agonist), benztropine (an anticholinergic), and entacapone (a COMT inhibitor) are used in specific situations but are not as effective as levodopa/carbidopa for initial treatment in older patients.",9
8675,"The patient is experiencing a myocardial infarction, likely due to cocaine use, as indicated by the ST segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, which suggests an inferior wall MI. The sudden loss of consciousness during the ECG recording suggests a life-threatening arrhythmia, possibly ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. In such cases, the most appropriate immediate management is unsynchronized cardioversion, also known as defibrillation, to restore a perfusing rhythm. Synchronized cardioversion is used for stable tachyarrhythmias, while unsynchronized cardioversion is used for pulseless or unstable rhythms.",9
8681,"The patient's presentation is consistent with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri. This condition is characterized by increased intracranial pressure without an identifiable cause on imaging. The key features include headache, transient visual obscurations, papilledema, and elevated opening pressure on lumbar puncture. The patient is also obese, which is a common risk factor for IIH.

The first-line treatment for IIH is acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that reduces cerebrospinal fluid production and helps lower intracranial pressure. Other options like optic nerve sheath fenestration and ventricular shunting are considered in cases where there is significant vision loss or when medical management fails. Furosemide is not typically the first choice for IIH.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management for this patient is acetazolamide therapy.",10
8682,"The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are indicative of a sexually transmitted infection. The presence of painful vesicular ulcers on the labia and tender inguinal lymphadenopathy strongly suggests a viral etiology. Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is known for causing painful genital ulcers and systemic symptoms such as fever and headache. Chlamydia trachomatis typically causes urethritis or cervicitis and does not present with vesicular ulcers. Klebsiella granulomatis causes granuloma inguinale, which presents with painless ulcers. Treponema pallidum causes syphilis, which initially presents with a painless chancre. Therefore, the most likely pathogen is Herpes simplex virus type 2.",9
8693,"The patient is a 4-day-old girl with worsening jaundice and elevated unconjugated bilirubin levels. The family history suggests a possible genetic condition affecting bilirubin metabolism, such as Crigler-Najjar syndrome. Phototherapy is typically used for neonatal jaundice, but in severe cases like Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I, it may not be sufficient. The fact that phototherapy is not controlling the hyperbilirubinemia suggests a more severe condition. Plasma exchange transfusion is indicated in severe cases of hyperbilirubinemia that do not respond to phototherapy, as it can rapidly reduce bilirubin levels and prevent kernicterus.",9
8689,"The patient's symptoms include right lower abdominal pain, multiple non-bloody watery bowel movements, abdominal cramping, palpitations, shortness of breath, facial flushing, and weight loss. These symptoms are suggestive of a carcinoid syndrome, which is caused by a carcinoid tumor. The flushing, wheezing, and diarrhea are classic symptoms of carcinoid syndrome due to the release of serotonin and other vasoactive substances. The elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) could indicate liver metastasis, which is common in carcinoid tumors. The history of travel to Cambodia and smoking are less relevant to the symptoms described. The presence of telangiectasia (tiny blood vessels) on the face and arms also supports the diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome. Other options like Ascaris lumbricoides infection, pheochromocytoma, and inflammatory bowel disease do not fully explain the combination of symptoms, especially the flushing and wheezing.",9
8696,"The patient's symptoms and history are suggestive of Wernicke's encephalopathy, which is commonly associated with alcohol use disorder. The key features include confusion, ataxia (unsteady gait), and ophthalmoplegia (nystagmus in this case). This condition is caused by a deficiency in thiamine (Vitamin B1). Alcoholics are at risk for thiamine deficiency due to poor nutritional intake and impaired absorption. Supplementation with Vitamin B1 could have prevented the development of Wernicke's encephalopathy in this patient.",9
8691,"The patient's symptoms and sigmoidoscopy findings suggest ulcerative colitis, a form of inflammatory bowel disease. The medication she received likely caused photosensitivity, a known side effect of sulfasalazine, which is commonly used to treat ulcerative colitis. Sulfasalazine is a prodrug that is metabolized into 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), which acts as a COX inhibitor, reducing inflammation in the colon. The photosensitivity reaction aligns with sulfasalazine use.",9
8653,,0
8702,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The key features include hematuria, bilateral flank pain, recurrent urinary tract infections, a family history of kidney failure, hypertension, and palpable flank masses. The elevated serum creatinine indicates impaired kidney function. ADPKD is known to be associated with cerebral saccular aneurysms (berry aneurysms), which can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage if they rupture. The other options are less likely to be directly associated with ADPKD: vesicoureteral reflux is more related to recurrent UTIs and kidney scarring, portal hypertension is related to liver disease, and osteolytic bone lesions are associated with conditions like multiple myeloma.",9
8704,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Key features include hemolytic anemia (evidenced by low hemoglobin, elevated LDH, low haptoglobin, and indirect hyperbilirubinemia), pancytopenia (low WBC and platelet counts), and dark urine in the morning without RBCs on urinalysis. The negative Coombs test and absence of splenomegaly further support this diagnosis. PNH is associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis, particularly in unusual sites such as the hepatic, cerebral, and abdominal veins. Therefore, the patient is at greatest risk for venous thrombosis.",9
8708,"The patient's symptoms of bilateral blurry vision and difficulty driving at night, along with the slit-lamp finding of cloudy opacities of the lenses, suggest cataracts. In the context of diabetes, cataracts can develop due to the accumulation of sorbitol in the lens. This occurs because glucose is converted to sorbitol by the enzyme aldose reductase. Sorbitol can accumulate in tissues where it is not further metabolized efficiently, leading to osmotic and oxidative stress, which contributes to cataract formation. Therefore, the increased activity of aldose reductase is responsible for the development of cataracts in this diabetic patient.",9
8715,"The cell line in question binds to antigen-presenting cells via the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. This suggests that the lymphocytes are likely cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ T cells), as these cells recognize antigens presented by MHC class I molecules. The activation of cytotoxic T cells typically requires interleukin 2 (IL-2) as a co-stimulatory signal. IL-2 is crucial for the proliferation and activation of T cells, including cytotoxic T cells. Therefore, the signaling molecule required for co-activation in this context is interleukin 2.",9
8713,"The patient has a family history of ovarian cancer and presents with a breast lump that, upon biopsy, shows atypical glandular cells with stellate morphology, which is suggestive of breast cancer. The family history and the type of cancer suggest a possible hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, often associated with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. These genes are involved in the homologous recombination repair pathway, which is responsible for repairing double-strand DNA breaks. Therefore, an abnormality in the homologous recombination pathway is most likely in this patient.",9
8718,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs consistent with atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The irregular pulse and ECG findings likely confirm AF. The presence of bilateral pitting edema, bibasilar crackles, and reduced ejection fraction indicate heart failure. In AF with a duration longer than 48 hours, anticoagulation is necessary before cardioversion to prevent thromboembolism. Rivaroxaban, a direct oral anticoagulant, can be used for anticoagulation. The patient should be anticoagulated for 3–4 weeks before attempting cardioversion. Therefore, the optimal therapy is to start rivaroxaban, perform cardioversion after adequate anticoagulation, and continue rivaroxaban to prevent stroke.",9
8719,"The patient is experiencing symptoms of heart failure exacerbation, and furosemide, a loop diuretic, is used to manage fluid overload. However, her urine output is minimal after administration, indicating diuretic resistance. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like diclofenac can cause renal vasoconstriction and reduce renal blood flow, leading to decreased efficacy of diuretics. This is because NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, which is necessary for maintaining renal perfusion, especially in states of reduced effective circulating volume like heart failure. The other medications listed do not have the same impact on renal function or diuretic efficacy.",9
8721,"The clinical presentation of the 9-year-old boy includes fever, bleeding, fatigue, pallor, and pancytopenia (low hemoglobin, low leukocyte count, and low platelet count). The reticulocyte count is also low, indicating decreased production of red blood cells. These findings suggest bone marrow failure. The absence of organomegaly and the presence of pancytopenia with a low reticulocyte count point towards aplastic anemia. Aplastic anemia is characterized by a hypocellular bone marrow that is replaced by fat. Therefore, the bone marrow biopsy is most likely to show hypocellular fat-filled marrow with red blood cells of normal morphology.",9
8722,"The patient's symptoms and the characteristics of the murmur suggest hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The murmur described is a harsh systolic, crescendo-decrescendo murmur best heard at the lower left sternal border, which is typical for HCM. The fact that the murmur increases in intensity when moving from a squatting to a standing position and decreases when clenching fists is consistent with the dynamic obstruction seen in HCM. In HCM, the obstruction is due to the hypertrophied septum causing outflow tract obstruction, which is affected by changes in preload and afterload. The most common genetic cause of HCM is a defect in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene. Therefore, the most likely cause of her condition is a myosin heavy chain defect.",9
8723,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a hemolytic anemia. The key points include recurrent abdominal swelling, stunted growth, history of multiple blood transfusions, family history of jaundice and gallstones, splenomegaly, and laboratory findings of anemia with increased reticulocytes and increased MCHC. The negative Coombs test rules out autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The increased osmotic fragility test is characteristic of hereditary spherocytosis, a condition caused by defects in the red blood cell membrane proteins leading to spherocyte formation and hemolysis. This condition is also associated with gallstones due to increased bilirubin from hemolysis. The peripheral blood smear likely shows spherocytes, which are small, dense red blood cells without central pallor. These findings are consistent with hereditary spherocytosis.",9
8684,,0
8701,"The patient presents with slurred speech and hesitancy in speaking, suggesting a form of expressive aphasia. His language comprehension and repetition are intact, which aligns with transcortical motor aphasia. This type of aphasia is often associated with lesions in the watershed area between the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and the middle cerebral artery (MCA). In this scenario, the patient's difficulty speaking fluently while maintaining comprehension and repetition suggests an issue in this watershed area, rather than a direct middle cerebral artery infarct, which would likely cause more global language deficits.",9
8725,"The patient's symptoms and ECG findings suggest beta-blocker overdose. The bradycardia (pulse of 40/min), hypotension (blood pressure of 85/50 mm Hg), hypoglycemia (blood glucose of 62 mg/dL), and prolonged PR interval with narrow QRS complexes on ECG are consistent with this. The cold, clammy extremities and wheezing also support this diagnosis, as beta-blockers can cause bronchospasm. Atropine and IV fluids have not improved his condition, which is typical in beta-blocker overdose. Glucagon is the antidote for beta-blocker toxicity as it increases intracellular cAMP independent of beta-adrenergic receptors, helping to improve heart rate and contractility. Therefore, glucagon is the most appropriate next step in management.",9
8732,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of hyperviscosity syndrome, which is common in conditions with high levels of circulating immunoglobulins, such as Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. The key symptoms include decreased consciousness, blurred vision, and bleeding, which align with hyperviscosity. The presence of monoclonal gammopathy and lymphadenopathy, along with hepatosplenomegaly, further supports this diagnosis. Plasmapheresis is the treatment of choice for hyperviscosity syndrome as it rapidly reduces the levels of circulating immunoglobulins, thereby alleviating symptoms.",9
8735,"The patient is started on atorvastatin, which is a statin medication used to lower cholesterol levels. One of the known side effects of statins, including atorvastatin, is the potential for elevated liver enzymes, or transaminases. This occurs because statins can affect liver function, leading to an increase in liver enzyme levels. While other side effects like muscle pain or rhabdomyolysis are also possible, the question specifically asks about the most likely development, which in this context is elevated transaminases. Bloating, cholelithiasis, and flushing are not commonly associated with atorvastatin use.",9
8743,"The patient's symptoms of constipation, trouble urinating, and confusion, along with hypotension and fever, suggest anticholinergic toxicity and possibly neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). Chlorpromazine, a typical antipsychotic, is known for its anticholinergic side effects and can also cause NMS, which fits the presentation of fever, confusion, and autonomic instability (hypotension). The other medications listed, such as haloperidol, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole, are less likely to cause this combination of symptoms, particularly the anticholinergic effects.",9
8737,"The newborn in this scenario was born prematurely at 26 weeks' gestation and has a history of requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. The current symptoms include respiratory distress, retractions, and diffuse granular densities with basal atelectasis on chest x-ray. These findings are consistent with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a common complication in premature infants who have received prolonged oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation. BPD is characterized by the need for prolonged respiratory support and oxygen therapy, along with characteristic radiographic findings. The other options are less likely given the clinical context and typical presentation of BPD in premature infants.",9
8744,"The patient presents with irregular menses, galactorrhea (milky nipple discharge), fatigue, and weight gain. She has a history of hypothyroidism and has not been taking her levothyroxine, resulting in an elevated TSH level (17.0 μU/mL). Her serum prolactin is also elevated at 85 ng/mL. Clozapine, an antipsychotic, can increase prolactin levels, but the significant elevation in TSH suggests that hypothyroidism is contributing to the elevated prolactin. In primary hypothyroidism, elevated TRH (thyrotropin-releasing hormone) can stimulate prolactin release from the pituitary gland, leading to hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea. The absence of visual field abnormalities makes a prolactinoma less likely, and there is no indication of a thyrotropic pituitary adenoma or ectopic prolactin production. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the nipple discharge is hypothyroidism causing elevated TRH and subsequent hyperprolactinemia.",9
8740,"The patient presents with joint pain, a history of sun sensitivity, and hematologic abnormalities (anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia). These symptoms are suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The sunburn associated with surfing could indicate photosensitivity, a common feature of SLE. The hematologic findings are consistent with the cytopenias often seen in SLE due to immune-mediated destruction. The most specific antibody associated with SLE is anti-dsDNA antibodies, which are often present in patients with this condition. The other options are less likely: Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies are associated with rheumatoid arthritis, degenerated cartilage is associated with osteoarthritis, and IgM against parvovirus B19 is associated with a viral infection that can cause arthralgia but not the full spectrum of symptoms seen here.",9
8751,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible acute HIV infection, which may not be detected by standard HIV tests if performed too early. A rapid HIV test might still be negative during the acute phase due to the window period. The ELISA and Western blot tests are typically used for confirmation but may also be negative early on. The best approach is to wait for the window period to pass and then retest. The monospot test is used for mononucleosis, and VDRL is for syphilis, neither of which are the primary concern here given the suspicion of acute HIV. Therefore, the best step is to retest with ELISA and Western blot after the window period.",9
8747,"The patient presents with diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and dark red stools after returning from Mexico. The stool culture shows organisms with ingested erythrocytes, which is indicative of Entamoeba histolytica, a protozoan that causes amebic dysentery. The presence of ingested erythrocytes in the stool is characteristic of this infection. The appropriate treatment for intestinal amebiasis involves two steps: first, treating the active infection with a tissue-acting agent, and then eliminating any luminal cysts with a luminal agent. Metronidazole is the drug of choice for treating the active infection caused by Entamoeba histolytica. Therefore, in addition to supportive therapy, the most appropriate next step in management is to administer Metronidazole.",9
8754,"The patient presents with jaundice, nausea, and loss of appetite, which are symptoms consistent with hepatitis. The hepatitis panel shows that the patient is positive for Anti-HAV IgM, indicating an acute Hepatitis A infection. Hepatitis A is primarily transmitted via the fecal-oral route, often through contaminated food or water. The other options (sexual contact, blood transfusion, and perinatal) are not common modes of transmission for Hepatitis A.",9
8752,"The patient presents with flank pain, myalgia, reddish urine, and a recent history of antibiotic use. The urinalysis shows proteinuria, hematuria, and pyuria without bacteria, which suggests a non-infectious cause. The presence of a rash and recent antibiotic use points towards an allergic reaction. Allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN) is a common cause of acute kidney injury following exposure to certain medications, including antibiotics. The combination of rash, fever, eosinophilia (not provided but common in AIN), and renal impairment after antibiotic use is characteristic of AIN. Pyelonephritis is less likely due to the absence of bacteria and costovertebral angle tenderness. Crystal-induced acute kidney injury would typically show crystals in the urine. Thin basement membrane disease is a hereditary condition causing hematuria but does not fit the acute presentation and recent medication history.",9
8748,"The patient presents with symptoms of fever, fatigue, hemoptysis, weight loss, and dark-colored urine. Laboratory findings show anemia (hematocrit 34%), significant proteinuria (2 g/24 hours), hematuria (more than 5 RBCs per high power field), elevated serum urea and creatinine, and positive anti-MPO/P-ANCA. The renal biopsy reveals glomerulonephritis with crescent formation, indicating rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.

The positive anti-MPO/P-ANCA is associated with conditions such as microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and Churg-Strauss syndrome (now known as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis). However, Churg-Strauss syndrome typically presents with asthma, eosinophilia, and systemic vasculitis, which are not mentioned in this case.

Microscopic polyangiitis is characterized by necrotizing vasculitis affecting small vessels, often presenting with renal involvement (crescentic glomerulonephritis) and pulmonary symptoms (such as hemoptysis) due to pulmonary capillaritis. The absence of granulomatous inflammation and the presence of positive P-ANCA (anti-MPO) support the diagnosis of microscopic polyangiitis.

Disseminated tuberculosis would not typically present with these specific laboratory findings, especially the positive P-ANCA and crescentic glomerulonephritis.

Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is associated with medium-sized vessel vasculitis and does not typically cause glomerulonephritis or positive ANCA serology.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is microscopic polyangiitis.",9
8755,"The patient is a farmer who likely has exposure to various chemicals, including pesticides and herbicides, which can be metabolized by the liver. The liver contains cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are involved in the metabolism of many xenobiotics, including potential carcinogens. These enzymes can convert procarcinogens into active carcinogens, leading to DNA damage and potentially contributing to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient's occupation and the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma suggest that cytochrome P450 monooxygenases played a role in the pathogenesis of his condition by activating environmental carcinogens.",9
8757,"The patient presents with recurrent episodes of joint swelling, particularly in the knee, and a history of a rash. He lives in Connecticut, a region endemic for Lyme disease, which is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi. The synovial fluid analysis shows a high leukocyte count with a predominance of neutrophils, which is consistent with an inflammatory process. The negative Gram stain and the serologic confirmation suggest a diagnosis that is not bacterial in the traditional sense, such as Lyme disease. The history of a rash, possibly erythema migrans, further supports this diagnosis. Rheumatoid arthritis is less likely due to the acute nature and pattern of joint involvement. Neisseria gonorrhoeae would typically show a positive Gram stain or culture. Campylobacter jejuni is associated with reactive arthritis but is less likely given the context and serologic confirmation. Therefore, the most likely cause is Borrelia burgdorferi.",9
8765,"The lesion described is flat and pigmented, which rules out options that involve raised or depressed skin changes. A papule is a small, raised lesion, which does not fit the description of a flat lesion. A plaque is a larger, raised, flat-topped lesion, which also does not match the description. An ulcer is a depressed lesion with loss of epidermis, which is not applicable here. A macule is a flat, distinct, discolored area of skin less than 1 cm wide that does not involve any change in the thickness or texture of the skin. Since the lesion is flat and 6 mm in diameter, it fits the definition of a macule.",9
8759,"The patient presents with jaundice and scleral icterus, with laboratory findings showing an elevated total bilirubin of 2.8 mg/dL and a direct bilirubin of 0.2 mg/dL, indicating predominantly unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The normal reticulocyte count and peripheral blood smear suggest that hemolysis is not the cause. The history of taking primaquine, which can precipitate hemolysis in individuals with G6PD deficiency, is notable, but the normal reticulocyte count and lack of hemolysis on the smear make this less likely. The positive anti-HAV IgG indicates past hepatitis A infection, and anti-HBs positivity indicates immunity to hepatitis B, likely from vaccination. Gilbert's syndrome is characterized by mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, often triggered by stress or fasting, and fits the clinical picture. Rotor and Dubin-Johnson syndromes cause conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which is not consistent with the lab findings. Hepatitis B infection is unlikely given the serology and normal liver enzymes.",9
8769,"Specificity is calculated as the number of true negatives divided by the total number of actual negatives. In this study, there are 2,000 patients, and 1,200 are known to be infected with EBV, leaving 800 who are EBV-free. Of these 800 EBV-free patients, 20 tested positive, meaning 780 tested negative. Thus, the specificity is 780 true negatives out of 800 actual negatives, which is 780/800 = 0.975 or 97.5%. This rounds to 98%.",9
8772,"The patient's presentation of depigmented patches on the trunk, thighs, hands, feet, and around the mouth, which have gradually increased in size over 2 years without associated symptoms like itchiness, redness, numbness, or pain, is characteristic of vitiligo. Vitiligo is an autoimmune condition where the immune system attacks and destroys melanocytes, the cells responsible for producing skin pigment. The history of emigration from Indonesia is not directly relevant to the diagnosis of vitiligo, as it is a condition that can occur in any ethnic group. The lack of symptoms such as numbness or pain makes Mycobacterium leprae infection (leprosy) less likely, as leprosy often presents with sensory loss. Postinflammatory depigmentation would typically follow an inflammatory event, which is not described here. Increased mTOR signaling is not associated with depigmented patches. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's skin findings is autoimmune melanocyte destruction.",9
8774,"Achondroplasia is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene. Individuals with achondroplasia are typically heterozygous for the mutation. When two individuals with achondroplasia have children, there are three possible genotypes for their offspring: homozygous normal (25% chance), heterozygous for achondroplasia (50% chance), and homozygous for the achondroplasia mutation (25% chance). Homozygosity for the achondroplasia mutation is usually lethal, leading to intrauterine fetal demise. In this scenario, the couple's first son has achondroplasia (heterozygous), their daughter is phenotypically normal (homozygous normal), and they experienced an IUFD, likely due to a homozygous achondroplasia mutation. Therefore, there is a 75% chance of having a viable offspring (25% normal + 50% heterozygous achondroplasia).",9
8776,"The clinical presentation suggests an infection with a bacterial pathogen that causes bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain. The history of visiting a petting zoo and the specific culture conditions provide clues to the organism's identity. The stool cultures growing at 42°C and turning black after adding phenylenediamine indicate the presence of oxidase-positive bacteria. The organism is likely Campylobacter jejuni, which is a common cause of bloody diarrhea and is associated with animal exposure. Campylobacter jejuni is a gram-negative, flagellated bacterium that does not ferment lactose, fitting the description in option B.",9
8777,"The infant presents with feeding difficulties, rapid breathing, and sweating during feeding, which are signs of heart failure. The murmur described is continuous, starting after S1 and obscuring S2, best heard at the second left intercostal space and radiating to the left clavicle. This is characteristic of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), which causes a continuous ""machinery"" murmur due to blood flow from the aorta to the pulmonary artery throughout the cardiac cycle. The symptoms of heart failure are due to increased pulmonary blood flow and volume overload. The other options do not match the murmur description or the clinical presentation as closely as PDA does.",9
8778,"The study described involves identifying a group of patients (active cocaine users without a history of syphilis) and following them over time to see if they develop syphilis. This approach is characteristic of a cohort study, where subjects are followed over a period to observe outcomes. Since the study involves looking back at medical records to identify the initial cohort and then following them forward in time, it is specifically a retrospective cohort study. This is because the exposure (cocaine use) was identified from past records, and the outcome (development of syphilis) was assessed over a subsequent period.",9
8781,"The patient's symptoms and the mechanism of injury suggest a ligamentous injury. The key detail in the physical examination is the 8 mm of backward translation of the foreleg when pressure is applied to the proximal tibia. This is indicative of a positive posterior drawer test, which is used to assess the integrity of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). The PCL prevents posterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur. Given the mechanism of injury (falling on a flexed knee) and the positive posterior drawer test, the most likely injured structure is the posterior cruciate ligament.",9
8779,"The patient's symptoms of fever, muscle rigidity, confusion, and cola-colored urine suggest a diagnosis of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS). NMS is a life-threatening condition often associated with the use of antipsychotic medications, particularly first-generation antipsychotics. The symptoms include hyperthermia, autonomic dysregulation, altered mental status, and generalized muscle rigidity. The cola-colored urine indicates myoglobinuria, which can occur due to rhabdomyolysis, a complication of severe muscle rigidity. Chlorpromazine is a first-generation antipsychotic and is known to cause NMS. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine, levodopa is used in Parkinson's disease, and phenytoin is an anticonvulsant, none of which are typically associated with NMS. Therefore, the most likely medication responsible for this patient's condition is chlorpromazine.",9
8782,"The patient has poorly controlled type I diabetes mellitus, as indicated by her high hemoglobin A1c of 13.7%. Poor glycemic control during early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of congenital anomalies, particularly neural tube defects (NTDs) and cardiac defects. The risk of aneuploidy is not specifically increased by maternal diabetes. Neonatal hyperglycemia is not a concern; rather, neonatal hypoglycemia is more common in infants of diabetic mothers. Oligohydramnios is not directly associated with maternal diabetes; polyhydramnios is more common due to fetal polyuria. Therefore, the fetus is at increased risk for neural tube defects due to the mother's poorly controlled diabetes.",9
8785,"In this study, the use of MRI in addition to conventional mammography may lead to earlier detection of breast cancer. This earlier detection can result in an apparent increase in survival time from the point of diagnosis, not because the patients are living longer, but because the disease was detected earlier. This is known as lead-time bias. Lead-time bias occurs when earlier detection of a disease (due to more sensitive screening) is mistaken for increased survival, even though the actual course of the disease has not changed. Therefore, the observed increase in median survival time in the MRI group could be due to lead-time bias rather than a true improvement in outcomes.",9
8762,"The patient presents with microcytic anemia, as indicated by the low hemoglobin, hematocrit, and mean corpuscular volume (MCV). The most common cause of microcytic anemia in this age group is iron deficiency anemia, often due to chronic blood loss. Given the slight weight loss and the patient's age, a gastrointestinal source of bleeding should be considered. While iron supplementation could address the anemia, it wouldn't address the underlying cause if it is due to gastrointestinal bleeding. A colonoscopy would help identify potential sources of bleeding, such as colon cancer or polyps. Therefore, the best next step in management is to investigate the potential cause of the anemia with a colonoscopy.",9
8786,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of acute cholangitis, which is characterized by right upper quadrant pain, fever, and jaundice (Charcot's triad). The elevated direct bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase suggest an obstructive process, likely due to a common bile duct stone. Initial management with antibiotics and supportive care has improved her fever, but the underlying obstruction needs to be addressed to prevent recurrence or worsening of the condition. ERCP is the procedure of choice for both diagnosis and treatment of choledocholithiasis (common bile duct stones) and can relieve the obstruction by removing the stone. Therefore, the next step in management is to perform an ERCP.",9
8791,"In normal physiology, hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen is influenced by several factors, including the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (CO2). In the lungs, where CO2 levels are lower, hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen increases, facilitating oxygen uptake. This is represented by a leftward shift in the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve. A left shift indicates increased affinity for oxygen, meaning hemoglobin binds oxygen more readily. Therefore, if the synthetic hemoglobin mimics normal hemoglobin, reducing CO2 levels should result in a left-shifted curve with increased oxygen binding.",9
8790,"The scenario describes a postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony that is unresponsive to conservative management, necessitating a hysterectomy. During a hysterectomy, the uterine arteries, which supply the uterus, must be ligated to control bleeding. These arteries run through the cardinal ligament, which is a major support structure of the uterus and contains the uterine vessels. Therefore, ligating the vessels in the cardinal ligament is necessary to achieve hemostasis during a hysterectomy.",9
8792,"The patient's symptoms of recurrent abdominal pain, bloating, and loose stools, along with the variability in pain location and intensity, are suggestive of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The symptoms have worsened with stress, which is common in IBS. The normal laboratory findings, including negative IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody, rule out celiac disease. IBS is characterized by abdominal pain that is often relieved by defecation, which aligns with option C. Weight loss, bright red blood in the stool, and abdominal pain at night are not typical of IBS and would suggest other diagnoses.",9
8801,"The patient is presenting with symptoms and radiographic findings suggestive of a pulmonary infection. Given his HIV status and low CD4 count, he is at risk for opportunistic infections. The presence of partially acid-fast gram-positive branching rods in the bronchoalveolar lavage is indicative of a Nocardia infection. Nocardia species are aerobic actinomycetes that are partially acid-fast and can cause pulmonary infections, especially in immunocompromised individuals. The appropriate treatment for Nocardia infections is typically with a sulfonamide, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), which acts as a folate synthesis inhibitor. Therefore, the drug with a mechanism of action as a folate synthesis inhibitor is most appropriate for this patient.",9
8800,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest mitral valve prolapse (MVP) with mitral regurgitation. The key findings include a holosystolic murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla and a mid-systolic click, which are characteristic of MVP. The bilateral fine crackles indicate pulmonary congestion, likely due to mitral regurgitation leading to left-sided heart failure. The history of palpitations and anxiety can be associated with MVP as well. Myxomatous degeneration is the most common cause of MVP, where the valve leaflets become thickened and redundant, leading to prolapse. The other options do not fit as well: ectopic serotonin production is associated with carcinoid syndrome, inflammatory valve degeneration is more related to rheumatic heart disease, and catecholamine overproduction is linked to pheochromocytoma, neither of which match the clinical picture here.",9
8796,"The patient presents with hypertensive emergency, indicated by extremely high blood pressure and signs of end-organ damage (blurry vision, optic disc blurring, and retinal hemorrhages). The rapid decrease in blood pressure from 232/128 mm Hg to 190/105 mm Hg within five minutes suggests the use of a fast-acting antihypertensive agent. Additionally, the decrease in pulse rate from 94/min to 75/min suggests the involvement of a beta-blocker, which can reduce heart rate. Among the options, labetalol is a combined alpha and beta-blocker that can rapidly lower blood pressure and decrease heart rate, making it the most likely drug administered in this scenario.",9
8805,"The patient has been on prednisolone, a glucocorticoid, and has not taken it for 7 days. This suggests she may have secondary adrenal insufficiency due to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis from chronic glucocorticoid use. In secondary adrenal insufficiency, both ACTH and cortisol levels are low, as seen in this patient. Unlike primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease), secondary adrenal insufficiency does not typically cause hyperkalemia because aldosterone secretion is usually preserved. However, glucocorticoids have a permissive effect on catecholamines, and their deficiency can lead to hypotension and hypoglycemia. Hypokalemia is not expected in this scenario, as aldosterone is not affected. Hyponatremia can occur due to increased antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion in response to low cortisol levels, leading to water retention and dilutional hyponatremia. Therefore, the most likely laboratory abnormality in this patient is hyponatremia.",9
8808,"The patient's symptoms of increased anxiety, reeling sensation, sweating, palpitations, and acute hypertension suggest a possible catecholamine surge. The sudden onset and severe hypertension are characteristic of a pheochromocytoma, a tumor of the adrenal gland that secretes catecholamines. The family history of thyroid carcinoma could be relevant if considering multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes, but the acute presentation aligns more with pheochromocytoma. Increased urine metanephrines would be expected in this case due to excess catecholamine breakdown products.",9
8813,"The patient's symptoms and lab findings suggest a bleeding disorder. The increased bleeding time and abnormal ristocetin cofactor assay indicate a problem with platelet function, specifically related to von Willebrand factor (vWF). The increased PTT with normal PT suggests a defect in the intrinsic pathway, which is consistent with von Willebrand disease (vWD). Desmopressin is used to treat vWD because it increases the release of vWF from endothelial cells. In vWD, there is a deficiency or dysfunction of vWF, which is necessary for platelet adhesion and also stabilizes factor VIII. Therefore, the decreased levels of factor VIII are directly involved in the etiology of this patient's presentation, as vWF is responsible for carrying and protecting factor VIII in the circulation.",9
8814,"The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is often associated with a specific pattern of dyslipidemia. This pattern typically includes elevated triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol levels. This is due to insulin resistance, which affects lipid metabolism, leading to increased triglyceride production and decreased HDL levels. LDL levels may be normal or slightly elevated, but the characteristic finding is the combination of high triglycerides and low HDL. Given the patient's current management and lab results, this pattern of dyslipidemia is the most likely to be observed.",9
8810,"The symptoms and findings in this 1-month-old newborn suggest a diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism. The key features include poor feeding, a hoarse cry, lethargy, enlarged tongue (macroglossia), generalized hypotonia, and umbilical hernia. These are classic signs of congenital hypothyroidism, which is often due to thyroid dysgenesis. The large head circumference relative to length and weight, along with scleral icterus, also support this diagnosis. Biliary atresia would primarily cause jaundice and liver-related symptoms. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome includes macroglossia and umbilical hernia but is also associated with other features like macrosomia and organomegaly, which are not mentioned here. Congenital toxoplasmosis would present with different neurological and ocular findings. Therefore, the most likely cause of these findings is thyroid dysgenesis.",9
8804,"The patient presents with symptoms indicative of a lysosomal storage disorder, characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, easy bruising, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The bone marrow biopsy shows macrophages with a crinkled-paper appearance, which is characteristic of Gaucher cells. Gaucher disease is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme β-glucosidase (also known as glucocerebrosidase). This enzyme deficiency leads to the accumulation of glucocerebroside in macrophages, causing the symptoms observed in the patient.",10
8761,"The patient's presentation indicates hypocalcemia, as evidenced by her low serum calcium level (5.0 mg/dL). The increase in alkaline phosphatase suggests increased bone turnover, which may be due to a compensatory response to low calcium levels. The lifelong bone and muscle aches, non-specific limb tenderness, and long-standing symptoms suggest a possible genetic condition. Considering the symptoms and lab findings, the most likely condition is hypoparathyroidism or a related disorder. Additionally, the stress and diarrhea could be related to nutrient malabsorption or stress-related changes in diet. A key consideration here is DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome), which can present with hypocalcemia due to parathyroid gland aplasia or hypoplasia and is also associated with immune defects such as anaphylaxis during transfusions due to IgA deficiency or other immune-related issues. Therefore, anaphylaxis during transfusions is associated with a condition that could explain the hypocalcemia.",9
8817,"The clinical trial described involves patients with sickle cell disease, which is characterized by the presence of abnormal hemoglobin (HbS) that polymerizes under conditions of low oxygen, acidosis, or dehydration. This polymerization leads to the sickling of red blood cells, causing various complications such as stroke, aplastic crisis, and auto-splenectomy. Sickle cell disease is caused by a specific genetic mutation in the beta-globin gene. This mutation is a missense mutation where the amino acid glutamic acid is replaced by valine at the sixth position of the beta-globin chain (Glu6Val). This single amino acid substitution is responsible for the abnormal properties of hemoglobin S. Therefore, the type of mutation that leads to the development of sickle cell disease is a missense mutation.",9
8820,"The patient's symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, and prolonged nosebleeds, along with the physical exam findings of conjunctival pallor and petechiae, suggest a hematologic issue. The history of recent travel and treatment with an antibiotic raises suspicion for a condition related to bone marrow suppression. Given the past medical history of alcoholic hepatitis, aplastic anemia is a strong consideration, especially if the antibiotic was chloramphenicol, which is known to cause this condition. Aplastic anemia is characterized by pancytopenia due to bone marrow failure. The most relevant finding associated with aplastic anemia is a hypocellular bone marrow with fatty infiltration, as the bone marrow is unable to produce adequate blood cells.",9
8821,"The 95% confidence interval (CI) provides a range of values within which we can be 95% confident that the true difference in effect between the two medications lies. In this study, the CI is 14 [10-21], meaning we are 95% confident that the true difference in efficacy between the two medications is between 10 and 21. 

Option A is incorrect because it describes the p-value, not the CI. 

Option B is incorrect because if a CI contains the value '0', it indicates that there is no statistically significant difference between the groups. 

Option C is correct because it accurately describes the purpose of the CI: it is the range of values that has a 95% probability of containing the true difference in effect. 

Option D is incorrect because the CI itself is not a threshold of statistical significance; rather, it is a range of values. The threshold of statistical significance is typically determined by the p-value.",9
8825,"The patient presents with recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia, as evidenced by her low fasting glucose level of 38 mg/dL. Her symptoms improve with sugar intake, which is typical for hypoglycemia. The elevated insulin level (260 μU/mL) and C-peptide level (5.0 ng/mL) suggest endogenous insulin production, as exogenous insulin administration would not increase C-peptide levels. The proinsulin level is also elevated, which is consistent with increased insulin production from a pancreatic source. The absence of insulin secretagogues rules out medications as a cause. These findings are indicative of an insulin-producing tumor, such as an insulinoma, which is a type of pancreatic β-cell tumor.",9
8829,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with Parkinson's disease, including resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia (slow, shuffling gait). The most effective treatment for Parkinson's disease is levodopa, which is often given in combination with carbidopa. Carbidopa is used to prevent the peripheral conversion of levodopa to dopamine, which reduces peripheral side effects such as nausea and allows more levodopa to reach the brain. Carbidopa works by inhibiting the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. Therefore, the mechanism of the second drug given to prevent adverse effects of levodopa therapy is the inhibition of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase.",9
8831,"The patient has a murmur after S2 over the left sternal border, which is characteristic of aortic regurgitation. Aortic regurgitation can lead to a wide pulse pressure due to the backflow of blood into the left ventricle during diastole. This condition can also cause a diastolic murmur and is associated with a bounding pulse. A common finding in aortic regurgitation is a femoral artery murmur, also known as Duroziez's sign, which is a systolic and diastolic murmur heard over the femoral artery when it is compressed. This is due to the increased stroke volume and rapid runoff of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle.",9
8830,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are suggestive of hyperthyroidism, specifically Graves' disease. The key features include fatigue, weight loss despite increased appetite, tachycardia, hypertension, warm moist skin, diffuse non-tender goiter, and ophthalmopathy (swelling of the eyelids and proptosis). Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of thyrotropin receptor autoantibodies (TRAb), which stimulate the thyroid gland to produce excess thyroid hormones, leading to hyperthyroidism. The presence of ophthalmopathy is particularly indicative of Graves' disease, as it is associated with these autoantibodies. Other options such as thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies are more commonly associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which typically presents with hypothyroidism, not hyperthyroidism.",9
8837,"The patient has schizophrenia and has not responded well to multiple antipsychotic medications, including aripiprazole, haloperidol, and loxapine. He continues to experience significant positive symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. Clozapine is indicated for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, which is defined as a lack of response to at least two different antipsychotic medications. Given the patient's lack of response to multiple medications and ongoing severe symptoms, clozapine is the appropriate choice.",9
8834,"The patient presents with splenomegaly, fatigue, and laboratory findings of leukocytosis (65,000/mm3) and thrombocytosis (500,000/mm3). These findings suggest a myeloproliferative disorder. The leukocyte count is significantly elevated, which is characteristic of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). CML is associated with the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, which is a result of a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, not 15 and 17. The other options can be ruled out as follows: Auer rods are associated with acute myeloid leukemia, particularly acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which is linked to the translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17. The JAK2 mutation is commonly associated with polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis, not CML. Therefore, the laboratory studies are most likely to show the Philadelphia chromosome.",9
8843,"The patient's age and the characteristics of the breast mass are key factors in determining the most likely diagnosis. She is 24 years old, which makes certain breast conditions more probable. The mass is described as round, rubbery, and mobile, which are classic features of a fibroadenoma. Fibroadenomas are common benign breast tumors in young women, typically presenting as painless, mobile, and well-circumscribed masses. 

Fibrocystic changes (A) usually present with multiple lumps and are often associated with cyclic breast pain, which is not mentioned here. Cystosarcoma phyllodes (C) is less common and typically presents as a rapidly growing mass, which is not consistent with the slow growth described. Ductal carcinoma in situ (D) is usually not palpable and is more common in older women.

Given the patient's age and the mass's characteristics, a fibroadenoma is the most likely diagnosis.",9
8851,"The study described has a significant flaw in its design: the lack of randomization. The first 1,000 patients received losartan, and the next 1,000 received salisartan, which introduces potential selection bias and confounding variables. Randomization is crucial in clinical trials to ensure that the groups are comparable and that the results are not influenced by external factors. This would improve the validity of the findings. While increasing the sample size can enhance the power of a study, it does not address the fundamental issue of bias due to lack of randomization. Posthoc analysis of patients who withdrew could provide additional insights but would not correct the initial design flaw. Retrial for clinical effectiveness instead of non-inferiority is a different approach but does not address the core issue of study design. Therefore, the most appropriate improvement would be randomization.",9
8854,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and a physical finding of a pulsatile abdominal mass, which is concerning for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The most appropriate next step in management is to evaluate the abdominal mass. While CT scan of the abdomen with contrast (option A) provides detailed information, it is not the initial step due to its invasiveness and use of contrast. Aortic arteriography (option B) is also invasive and not typically used for initial evaluation. PSA level testing (option C) is related to prostate issues but does not address the immediate concern of the abdominal mass. Abdominal ultrasonography (option D) is a non-invasive, cost-effective, and efficient method to evaluate the suspected AAA, making it the most appropriate next step.",9
8840,"The patient presents with normocytic anemia (normal MCV of 88 μm3) and a low reticulocyte count, indicating underproduction of red blood cells. Her chronic kidney disease (CKD) is significant, with a creatinine level of 3.1 mg/dL. In CKD, the kidneys' ability to produce erythropoietin is impaired, leading to anemia. The normal ferritin level suggests that iron deficiency is not the cause, and the normal MCV rules out vitamin B12 deficiency, which would cause macrocytic anemia. Autoantibodies against the thyroid gland would not directly cause anemia. Chronic occult blood loss would typically result in iron deficiency anemia, which is not supported by the normal ferritin level. Therefore, the most likely cause of her anemia is decreased erythropoietin production due to CKD.",9
8850,"The patient presents with fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain 10 days after surgery. The liver function tests show elevated AST and ALT, with a mild elevation in alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels. The hypoactive bowel sounds suggest decreased gastrointestinal activity, which can be seen in systemic inflammatory responses or infections. 

Acalculous cholecystitis is a common complication in critically ill patients, especially those who have undergone major surgery or trauma, and it can present with fever, right upper quadrant pain, and elevated liver enzymes. The absence of gallstones (acalculous) differentiates it from cholecystolithiasis, which typically involves gallstones.

Small bowel obstruction would more likely present with abdominal distension, vomiting, and more significant changes in bowel sounds, often hyperactive initially.

A hemolytic transfusion reaction would present with signs of hemolysis such as jaundice, hemoglobinuria, and a drop in hemoglobin levels, which are not indicated here.

Cholecystolithiasis involves gallstones and typically presents with biliary colic, but the acute presentation with fever and systemic signs is more suggestive of acalculous cholecystitis in this context.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is acalculous cholecystitis.",9
8856,"The clinical presentation suggests subacute thyroiditis (de Quervain's thyroiditis), characterized by a diffusely enlarged and tender thyroid gland, decreased TSH, and elevated ESR. This condition is often preceded by a viral infection and is associated with granulomatous inflammation. The histopathologic finding typically seen in subacute thyroiditis is mixed cellular infiltration with multinuclear giant cells.",9
8858,"The patient is currently drinking alcohol regularly and is not interested in cutting back on his consumption, despite discussing the benefits of abstaining. In the stages of change model, precontemplation is when the individual is not yet considering change or is unaware of the need to change. Contemplation is when the individual is aware of the problem and is considering change but has not yet committed to taking action. Since the patient is not interested in reducing his alcohol intake, he is in the precontemplation stage regarding his alcohol use.",9
8864,"The patient's symptoms and recent travel history suggest an infection with a bacterial pathogen. The stool culture results indicate nonlactose fermenting, oxidase-negative, gram-negative rods that do not produce hydrogen sulfide, which is characteristic of Shigella species. Shigella is known to cause dysentery, characterized by fever, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea. The pathogenesis of Shigella involves the invasion of colonic epithelial cells, particularly microfold (M) cells in the Peyer's patches of the intestine. This invasion leads to inflammation and ulceration, resulting in the symptoms observed in the patient.",9
8859,"The patient's symptoms and CSF findings suggest viral encephalitis, most likely due to herpes simplex virus (HSV). The key indicators are the confusion, fever, and lymphocytic predominance in the CSF. The MRI (not shown here) would typically show temporal lobe involvement in HSV encephalitis. The best treatment for HSV encephalitis is Acyclovir, an antiviral medication effective against HSV.",9
8863,"The patient's symptoms and clinical findings are suggestive of acute pericarditis. The sharp, central chest pain that worsens when lying down and improves when sitting forward is characteristic of pericarditis. The presence of a pericardial friction rub, described as a scratching sound, further supports this diagnosis. The mild elevation in serum troponin can occur in pericarditis due to inflammation of the epicardium. The ECG in pericarditis typically shows diffuse ST-segment elevations, which distinguishes it from ST-elevation myocardial infarction, where ST elevations are localized to specific leads. Costochondritis would not present with a friction rub or elevated troponin, and bacterial pneumonia would present with respiratory symptoms and possibly fever, which are not described here.",9
8860,"The process described involves the mixing of genetic material from two different strains of influenza virus (H7N1 and H3N8) within the same host cell, leading to the creation of a new strain (H7N8). This is a classic example of genetic reassortment, where segments of the viral genome are exchanged between different strains. This process is known as genetic shift, which is responsible for the emergence of new influenza virus subtypes with novel combinations of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins. Genetic drift, on the other hand, refers to the gradual accumulation of mutations over time within a single strain. Transformation and transduction are processes related to bacterial genetics and are not applicable to this viral context.",9
8865,"Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase (PRPP synthetase) is an enzyme involved in the synthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides. Overactivity of this enzyme can lead to increased production of purines, which are then broken down into uric acid. Excessive uric acid can accumulate and lead to gout, a condition characterized by painful joint inflammation due to uric acid crystal deposition. The other conditions listed (homocystinuria, maple syrup urine disease, and phenylketonuria) are metabolic disorders unrelated to purine metabolism and uric acid production.",9
8866,"The patient is experiencing an asthma exacerbation, and inhaled albuterol, a beta-2 agonist, did not provide relief. Ipratropium bromide, an anticholinergic agent, was used and improved his symptoms. Ipratropium works by blocking muscarinic receptors in the airways, which are part of the parasympathetic nervous system. This action prevents vagally-mediated bronchoconstriction, leading to bronchodilation. Therefore, the mechanism of action of ipratropium bromide is the inhibition of vagally-mediated contraction of bronchial smooth muscles.",9
8870,"The patient's symptoms are suggestive of neurogenic claudication, which is often due to lumbar spinal stenosis. The key features include pain that radiates down the buttocks and is relieved by sitting and leaning forward, which is typical for spinal stenosis. The negative straight leg raise test and the presence of degenerative changes on X-ray support this diagnosis. An MRI scan of the spine is the most appropriate next step to confirm lumbar spinal stenosis, as it provides detailed images of the spinal canal and can identify any narrowing or compression of the nerves.",9
8877,"The patient is a 45-year-old man with HIV and a low CD4+ count of 90/mm^3, indicating advanced immunosuppression. He presents with odynophagia (painful swallowing), which is a common symptom of esophageal candidiasis, especially in patients with HIV/AIDS. The most common cause of esophageal symptoms in patients with low CD4+ counts is Candida esophagitis. Given the presentation and the patient's immunocompromised state, empirical treatment for esophageal candidiasis is appropriate. Fluconazole is the first-line treatment for esophageal candidiasis. Endoscopy is not immediately necessary unless the patient does not respond to antifungal therapy or if the diagnosis is uncertain. Nystatin is not effective for esophageal candidiasis as it is used for oral thrush. Methylprednisolone is not indicated as there is no evidence of an inflammatory or allergic process.",9
8869,"The patient's presentation is consistent with herpes zoster (shingles), which is caused by reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus. The key features include pruritic and painful vesicles localized to a single dermatome, in this case, the right T10 dermatome. A common complication of herpes zoster is postherpetic neuralgia, which is characterized by persistent pain in the affected dermatome even after the rash has resolved. Other options like fever, pneumonia, and cerebellar ataxia are not typical complications of herpes zoster. Fever can occur with many infections but is not a specific complication of shingles. Pneumonia and cerebellar ataxia are more associated with primary varicella infection (chickenpox) rather than reactivation as shingles.",9
8873,"The patient presents with a pruritic rash on his penis that developed shortly after protected intercourse. The history of a similar reaction after blowing up balloons suggests a latex allergy, as balloons and condoms can both contain latex. The rash is described as well-circumscribed, raised, erythematous plaques, which are consistent with urticaria (hives), a common allergic reaction. The recent contact with a friend who had pruritus and required washing of bedding suggests scabies, but the acute onset after latex exposure points more towards an allergic reaction. The most appropriate treatment for an acute allergic reaction like urticaria is an oral antihistamine. Cetirizine is a second-generation antihistamine that is effective for treating allergic reactions with minimal sedation.",9
8878,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a prolactinoma, a type of pituitary adenoma that secretes prolactin. Her symptoms include galactorrhea (whitish nipple discharge), amenorrhea (missed periods), and bitemporal hemianopsia (loss of bilateral temporal vision), which is indicative of a mass effect on the optic chiasm. These symptoms align with hyperprolactinemia. To confirm the diagnosis of a prolactinoma, measuring serum prolactin levels is the most appropriate test.",9
8887,"Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a functional renal failure seen in patients with severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis, without any intrinsic renal pathology. The diagnosis of HRS is one of exclusion, meaning other causes of renal failure must be ruled out. Key criteria for HRS include low urine sodium, oliguria, and absence of shock, among others. Importantly, there should be no evidence of intrinsic renal disease, such as glomerulonephritis or acute tubular necrosis. The presence of 30 red cells/high powered field in the urine suggests glomerular disease or another form of intrinsic renal pathology, which would exclude the diagnosis of HRS.",9
8892,"The patient presents with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI) following catheterization, which is a common risk factor for UTIs. The presence of WBC casts suggests pyelonephritis. The urine culture results are key to identifying the pathogen. The mucoid, gray-white colonies on blood agar and purple colonies on eosin methylene blue (EMB) agar without a metallic green sheen suggest a lactose-fermenting organism that is not E. coli (which would show a metallic green sheen on EMB agar). Klebsiella pneumoniae is known for forming mucoid colonies due to its polysaccharide capsule and is a lactose fermenter that would appear as purple colonies on EMB agar without the metallic sheen. Proteus mirabilis is not a lactose fermenter and would not produce purple colonies on EMB agar. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is also not a lactose fermenter and would not produce purple colonies. Staphylococcus saprophyticus is a gram-positive organism and would not grow in the described manner on EMB agar, which selects for gram-negative bacteria.",9
8893,"The patient presents with signs of acute hepatitis B infection, as indicated by the positive hepatitis B surface antigen and negative hepatitis B surface antibody and core antibody. In adults, the most common outcome of acute hepatitis B infection is complete recovery with clearance of the virus, leading to a transient infection. Chronic infection or progression to fulminant hepatitis is less common in adults compared to children. The presence of scleral icterus and elevated liver enzymes suggests active liver inflammation, but these findings are typical of acute hepatitis and do not necessarily indicate a chronic or severe outcome. Therefore, the most likely outcome for this adult patient is a transient infection with eventual clearance of the virus.",9
8894,"The patient is experiencing symptoms consistent with biliary colic due to gallstones, which are likely cholesterol stones given her rapid weight loss and obesity. Ursodeoxycholic acid is a bile acid that can help dissolve cholesterol gallstones by reducing cholesterol saturation in bile. This is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for patients who do not wish to undergo surgery for cholesterol gallstones.",9
8891,"The patient underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and left salpingo-oophorectomy, which are surgical procedures that can potentially lead to complications such as injury to nearby structures. The key finding here is the patient's anuria (minimal urine output) post-surgery, despite stable vital signs and minimal residual urine on bladder scan, suggesting an obstruction or injury rather than a prerenal cause. 

The suspensory ligaments of the ovary (infundibulopelvic ligaments) are close to the ureters. During gynecological surgeries, especially hysterectomies, there is a risk of iatrogenic injury to the ureters. An injury to the ureters can lead to obstruction and subsequent anuria due to urine not reaching the bladder. The renal ultrasound likely shows hydronephrosis, which would be consistent with ureteral obstruction.

Prerenal azotemia and acute tubular necrosis would typically present with signs of hypovolemia or shock, which are not present here. Cervical cancer is unlikely given the patient's history and presentation.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's anuria and the ultrasound findings is an iatrogenic injury to the ureters near the suspensory ligaments during surgery.",9
8897,"The patient's symptoms of increasing forgetfulness, disorientation to time, and inability to recall recent events suggest a cognitive decline consistent with dementia. The MRI findings are not provided, but the clinical presentation is typical of Alzheimer's disease, which is characterized by atrophy of the cortex, particularly in the temporal and parietal lobes. This atrophy leads to the symptoms of memory loss and disorientation. Other options such as inflammation of the choroid plexus, demyelination, or obstruction of the foramen of Monro are less consistent with the described symptoms and typical findings in Alzheimer's disease.",9
8906,"The question involves comparing the distribution of categorical data (nausea levels: mild, moderate, severe) between two independent groups (treatment and control). The appropriate statistical test for comparing categorical data between two independent groups is the Chi-square test. This test assesses whether there is a significant association between the two categorical variables (treatment group and nausea level). The t-tests (unpaired and paired) are used for comparing means of continuous data, and the Pearson correlation coefficient is used for assessing the linear relationship between two continuous variables, neither of which is applicable here.",9
8908,"The patient has a 10-mm solid pulmonary nodule with irregular, scalloped borders. Given the patient's history of smoking and the characteristics of the nodule, there is a concern for malignancy. The irregular and scalloped borders suggest a higher risk of cancer. In such cases, further evaluation is warranted to assess the metabolic activity of the nodule, which can help differentiate between benign and malignant causes. Positron emission tomography (PET) is useful in evaluating the metabolic activity of pulmonary nodules and can help guide further management. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to perform a PET scan.",9
8910,"The child presents with persistent diarrhea, oral candidiasis, and RSV pneumonia, which are indicative of an immunodeficiency affecting both cellular and humoral immunity. The negative HIV PCR rules out HIV infection. The symptoms suggest a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), which is characterized by defective T cell function. This defect leads to increased susceptibility to infections, including opportunistic infections like oral candidiasis and severe viral infections like RSV pneumonia. Selective IgA deficiency would primarily cause recurrent mucosal infections but not the severe combined immunodeficiency picture seen here. Grossly reduced levels of B cells would suggest a condition like X-linked agammaglobulinemia, which typically presents later and with bacterial infections. An X-linked inheritance of HLA genes is not a recognized condition. Therefore, the most likely cause of this child's presentation is defective T cell function, consistent with SCID.",9
8929,"The patient is a 10-year-old boy who presents with signs of early puberty, including tall stature, muscular build, acne, and facial hair. Additionally, there is a right-sided testicular mass. These findings suggest an excess of androgens. A Leydig cell tumor is a testicular tumor that can secrete testosterone, leading to signs of precocious puberty. The presence of a testicular mass supports this diagnosis. Normal development in the setting of obesity would not typically present with a testicular mass. A pituitary adenoma could cause precocious puberty, but it would not explain the testicular mass. Precocious puberty is a symptom rather than an underlying diagnosis, and the testicular mass points towards a specific cause, such as a Leydig cell tumor.",9
8932,"The patient's symptoms and endoscopic findings suggest Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES), characterized by gastrin-secreting tumors (gastrinomas) leading to excessive gastric acid production. This results in recurrent peptic ulcers, especially in atypical locations like the distal duodenum, and diarrhea due to acid hypersecretion. 

In ZES, there is hypersecretion of gastrin, which stimulates parietal cells to produce more gastric acid. This leads to parietal cell hypertrophy due to the trophic effect of gastrin. 

Option A is incorrect because increasing omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, would decrease gastric acid secretion but not directly affect gastrin levels. 

Option B is incorrect because chronic atrophic gastritis typically leads to decreased gastrin levels due to loss of gastric mucosa and parietal cells. 

Option D is incorrect because gastrin acts via G-protein coupled receptors, not receptor tyrosine kinases.

Therefore, the most likely true statement about this patient's condition is that parietal cell hypertrophy is present due to the trophic effect of elevated gastrin levels.",9
8935,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of a spinal infection, likely vertebral osteomyelitis or a spinal epidural abscess, given the focal tenderness over the lumbar spine, fever, leukocytosis, and elevated CRP. His history of IV drug use increases the risk for infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, including MRSA. In such cases, empirical treatment should cover MRSA. Vancomycin is the appropriate choice for initial empirical therapy to cover MRSA until culture results are available.",9
8933,"The patient presents with wrist pain and swelling after a fall on an outstretched hand, which is a common mechanism for wrist injuries. The key details in the examination are the tenderness in the anatomical snuffbox area, which is bordered by the tendons of the abductor pollicis longus, extensor pollicis brevis, and extensor pollicis longus. This area is classically associated with scaphoid fractures. The fact that the patient can oppose the thumb and has decreased muscle strength suggests a bony injury rather than a soft tissue injury like De Quervain's tenosynovitis, which typically presents with pain on thumb movement but not necessarily decreased strength. Colles' fracture would present with a different mechanism and deformity, and a transscaphoid perilunate dislocation would likely present with more severe deformity and dysfunction. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis given the mechanism of injury and the location of tenderness is a scaphoid fracture.",9
8945,"The patient's symptoms and physical findings suggest a connective tissue disorder, likely systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). The thickened, waxy skin and firm white nodules on the fingertips are indicative of sclerodactyly and calcinosis, respectively. These are part of the CREST syndrome, which stands for Calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, Esophageal dysmotility, Sclerodactyly, and Telangiectasia. Given these findings, the most likely additional finding in this patient would be telangiectasia, which is a common feature of CREST syndrome.",9
8904,"The patient presents with sudden-onset severe pain and paresthesia in the right arm, along with decreased pulses and cold, pale skin, indicating acute arterial occlusion. The laboratory findings show thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), along with a positive D-dimer, suggesting a hypercoagulable state. The patient recently underwent surgery and likely received heparin, which can lead to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT is characterized by thrombocytopenia and a paradoxical risk of thrombosis due to the formation of antibodies against platelet factor 4-heparin complexes. This condition can cause arterial thrombosis, such as the occlusion of the brachial artery seen in this patient. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the symptoms is an adverse effect of medication, specifically heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.",9
8939,"The elevated levels of α-fetoprotein (AFP) in maternal serum and amniotic fluid, along with elevated acetylcholinesterase in the amniotic fluid, suggest a neural tube defect. An increased amniotic fluid volume (polyhydramnios) is also noted. Among the options, both myelomeningocele and anencephaly are neural tube defects that can cause elevated AFP levels. However, anencephaly is more likely to be associated with polyhydramnios due to impaired fetal swallowing. Holoprosencephaly and lissencephaly are not typically associated with elevated AFP or polyhydramnios. Therefore, the most likely condition is anencephaly.",9
8948,"The patient is in hospice care with a focus on palliative treatment, indicating that the primary goal is to manage symptoms and improve quality of life. She is experiencing severe pain despite receiving morphine and acetaminophen. The current dose of morphine (2 mg IV every 2 hours) is relatively low for someone with severe pain, and it is common in palliative care to titrate opioid doses to achieve adequate pain control. Concerns about respiratory depression are valid, but in a hospice setting, the priority is comfort, and opioids can be safely titrated under medical supervision. Increasing the morphine dose is appropriate to manage her pain effectively.",9
8943,"The patient presents with symptoms and examination findings consistent with open-angle glaucoma, including increased intraocular pressure, optic disk cupping, and visual field loss. The goal of treatment is to lower intraocular pressure to prevent further optic nerve damage. Topical prostaglandin analogs like latanoprost are often first-line treatments for open-angle glaucoma due to their efficacy in lowering intraocular pressure by increasing uveoscleral outflow. Topical timolol, a beta-blocker, is also used to decrease aqueous humor production, but prostaglandin analogs are generally preferred as initial therapy due to their superior efficacy and once-daily dosing. Pilocarpine is not typically first-line due to side effects and less efficacy. Laser iridotomy is used for angle-closure glaucoma, not open-angle glaucoma.",9
8947,"The clinical presentation of this patient suggests inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The symptoms of intermittent bloody diarrhea, tenesmus, fever, fatigue, and abdominal cramps, along with the physical findings of aphthous stomatitis, conjunctivitis, and joint tenderness, are consistent with IBD. The laboratory findings show anemia and leukocytosis, which are common in IBD due to chronic inflammation and blood loss.

The two main types of IBD are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Crohn's disease is characterized by discontinuous transmural inflammation, which can lead to 'skip lesions', strictures, and a cobblestone appearance on imaging. It can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus and often presents with non-caseating granulomas on biopsy.

Ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, involves continuous inflammation starting from the rectum and extending proximally, affecting only the mucosa and submucosa. It often presents with continuous ulcerated lesions, crypt abscesses, and pseudopolyps. The barium study in ulcerative colitis may show a 'lead pipe' appearance due to loss of haustral folds.

Given the symptoms and the findings, the most likely diagnosis is ulcerative colitis. Therefore, the expected findings on colonoscopy and barium study would be continuous ulcerated lesions with a lead pipe appearance.",9
8946,"The patient's symptoms and findings are suggestive of Graves' disease, which is an autoimmune hyperthyroid condition. The key ophthalmologic finding in Graves' disease is exophthalmos, which is caused by the infiltration of retro-orbital space by inflammatory cells and edema. This infiltration is primarily due to lymphocytes and other immune cells, leading to inflammation and swelling in the orbital tissues. This is not directly caused by antibodies like anti-thyroid peroxidase or anti-thyroglobulin, which are more associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Anti-myelin antibodies are not related to thyroid conditions. Therefore, the direct mechanism causing the patient's exophthalmos is lymphocytic infiltration.",9
8958,"The patient presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and signs of dehydration (dry mucous membranes) along with a fruity breath odor. The laboratory findings show a high blood glucose level (450 mg/dL), metabolic acidosis (pH 7.31, bicarbonate 16 mEq/L), and positive ketones in the urine. These findings are indicative of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which is commonly seen in type 1 diabetes mellitus due to the destruction of pancreatic beta cells. The fruity breath odor is due to acetone, a type of ketone. The elevated glucose and ketones, along with the acidosis, align with DKA. The other options do not explain the metabolic derangements and the specific symptoms observed in this patient.",9
8963,"The patient's symptoms suggest migratory thrombophlebitis, also known as Trousseau's syndrome, which is often associated with an underlying malignancy, particularly pancreatic cancer. The presence of tender, red nodules and a palpable cord-like structure on the chest wall, along with a history of similar episodes, supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient has gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and poor appetite, which can be associated with pancreatic cancer. Given these findings, the most appropriate next step in diagnosing the underlying condition is to perform imaging of the abdomen to look for a pancreatic tumor. Therefore, a CT scan of the abdomen is the most appropriate next step.",9
8965,"The patient presents with macrocytic anemia (MCV of 108 fl) and symptoms suggestive of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, such as glossitis and fatigue. Her alcohol use and malnourished appearance suggest a nutritional deficiency, likely folate deficiency, which is common in alcoholics. Both vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies can lead to elevated homocysteine levels. However, folate deficiency does not cause elevated methylmalonic acid, which is specific to vitamin B12 deficiency. Given the context of alcohol use and malnutrition, folate deficiency is more likely, leading to elevated homocysteine levels.",9
8959,"The patient's symptoms of fatigue, joint pain, and skin sensitivity to sunlight, along with her tanned appearance and diabetes mellitus, suggest the possibility of hemochromatosis. Hemochromatosis is characterized by iron overload, which can lead to skin hyperpigmentation (bronze diabetes), diabetes, and arthropathy, particularly affecting the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints. Given these clinical features, the most appropriate next step in diagnosis is to perform iron studies to assess for iron overload.",9
8966,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure, such as headaches, blurry vision, and double vision. The fundoscopic examination likely shows papilledema, and the MRI reveals an empty sella, which can be associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), especially in an obese woman of childbearing age. Her use of vitamin A is also a risk factor for IIH. The most appropriate next step in management for IIH is to perform a lumbar puncture, which can be both diagnostic and therapeutic by measuring opening pressure and relieving pressure.",9
8969,"The patient is a 40-year-old homeless man with a high blood alcohol level and liver function tests indicative of chronic alcohol use (elevated AST and ALT with AST:ALT ratio > 2:1, and elevated GGT). The confusion and slurred speech are consistent with acute alcohol intoxication. Given the history of alcohol use, the most likely presentation related to this condition would be an ataxic gait, which is common in alcohol intoxication due to its effects on the cerebellum. Pinpoint pupils are associated with opioid intoxication, vertical nystagmus is associated with PCP use, and high blood pressure is not directly related to acute alcohol intoxication.",9
8968,"The patient is diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is characterized by non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and acute inflammation of the alveoli. The key pathological feature of ARDS is damage to the alveolar-capillary membrane, leading to increased permeability and fluid accumulation in the alveoli. The cells primarily responsible for the symptoms in ARDS are the type I and type II pneumocytes found in the alveolar sacs. Type I pneumocytes are involved in gas exchange and are susceptible to damage, while type II pneumocytes produce surfactant and can proliferate to replace damaged type I cells. The pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is low, indicating that the edema is not due to cardiac causes, consistent with ARDS. Therefore, the cells responsible for the symptoms are located in the alveolar sacs.",9
8980,"The symptoms and history provided in the vignette suggest lead poisoning. The key points are the child's abdominal pain, constipation, fatigue, and the recent move to a house built in the 1940s with ongoing renovations, which raises the suspicion of lead exposure from old paint. The peripheral blood smear showing basophilic stippling of red blood cells is a classic finding in lead poisoning. Lead poisoning affects heme synthesis by inhibiting enzymes such as delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase and ferrochelatase. Among the options provided, inhibition of ferrochelatase is directly related to lead poisoning. Ferrochelatase is responsible for the incorporation of iron into protoporphyrin IX to form heme, and its inhibition leads to the accumulation of protoporphyrin and the symptoms observed.",9
8975,"The patient presents with sudden severe lower abdominal pain after intercourse, hypotension, tachycardia, and a tender adnexal mass. The ultrasound shows a sac-like structure with surrounding echogenic fluid, suggesting hemoperitoneum. These findings are consistent with a ruptured ovarian cyst, likely a hemorrhagic cyst given the acute presentation and anemia. The negative pregnancy test rules out ectopic pregnancy. The presence of free fluid (likely blood) and hemodynamic instability (hypotension and tachycardia) indicate significant intra-abdominal bleeding. In such cases, surgical intervention is necessary to control the bleeding and stabilize the patient. Therefore, the most appropriate management is emergency exploratory laparotomy.",9
8981,"The patient in this scenario experienced a sudden loss of consciousness due to a likely ventricular arrhythmia, given his history of severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction following a prior myocardial infarction. The ECG findings, although not visible here, likely showed a ventricular tachyarrhythmia, which was successfully cardioverted. In patients with a history of myocardial infarction and severe left ventricular dysfunction, the risk of sudden cardiac death due to ventricular arrhythmias is high. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is indicated in such cases to prevent future episodes of life-threatening arrhythmias. Intravenous magnesium sulfate is used for torsades de pointes, which is not indicated here. Intravenous adenosine is used for supraventricular tachycardias, not ventricular arrhythmias. Cardiac pacing is used for bradyarrhythmias, not for preventing ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Therefore, the best next step is to implant an ICD.",9
8982,"The patient presents with vision loss in the right eye and an afferent pupillary defect (APD) in the right eye, as indicated by the swinging flashlight test showing bilateral pupillary dilation when the light is moved from the left to the right eye. This suggests a defect in the optic nerve of the right eye. The optic nerve carries visual information from the retina to the brain. The first synapse of the optic nerve is in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus, which processes visual information before it is relayed to the visual cortex. Therefore, the nerve that is defective in this patient (the optic nerve) relays information to the lateral geniculate nucleus.",9
8976,"The patient presents with acute urinary retention due to BPH, which was relieved by catheterization. However, despite the relief of obstruction, the patient's urine output remains low (250 mL initially and 260 mL after 8 hours), indicating oliguria. Additionally, the serum creatinine is rising (from 1.4 mg/dL to 1.6 mg/dL), suggesting worsening renal function. The persistent oliguria and rising creatinine levels despite relief of obstruction suggest possible acute kidney injury (AKI), which warrants nephrology consultation. The urine output is a critical parameter here, as it indicates the kidneys are not producing enough urine, which is a sign of renal dysfunction.",9
8983,"The boy's short stature and the gain of function mutation in the FGFR3 gene are indicative of achondroplasia, a common form of dwarfism. Achondroplasia is characterized by disproportionate short stature, where the limbs are shorter compared to the trunk. The FGFR3 mutation leads to inhibited cartilage formation, affecting bone growth. Patients with achondroplasia often have characteristic physical features, including frontal bossing, midface hypoplasia, and a normal-sized trunk with short limbs. The other options do not align with achondroplasia: absent collar bones are associated with cleidocranial dysplasia, blue sclerae with osteogenesis imperfecta, and long extremities with Marfan syndrome. Therefore, the most likely additional finding in this patient is frontal bossing.",9
8986,"The patient presents with signs of dehydration due to diarrhea, as evidenced by hypotension, tachycardia, dry mucosa, and sunken eyes. The laboratory findings show elevated BUN and creatinine, indicating prerenal azotemia, likely due to decreased renal perfusion from hypovolemia. In prerenal azotemia, the kidneys conserve sodium and water to maintain intravascular volume. This results in low urine sodium concentration and low fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa+), as the kidneys reabsorb sodium efficiently. Additionally, urine osmolality is high because the kidneys concentrate urine to conserve water. Therefore, the expected findings in this patient are high urine osmolality, low FeNa+, and low urine Na+.",9
8990,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), including burning epigastric pain, cough, and regurgitation, with endoscopy showing hyperemia in the distal esophagus. The question asks for a drug that directly inhibits the common pathway of gastric acid secretion. Gastric acid secretion is stimulated by histamine, acetylcholine, and gastrin, all of which increase the activity of the H+/K+ ATPase (proton pump) in the parietal cells. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) like lansoprazole directly inhibit this proton pump, thereby blocking the final step of acid secretion. Other options like ranitidine (an H2 receptor antagonist) and pirenzepine (an anticholinergic) act upstream and do not directly inhibit the proton pump. Aluminum hydroxide is an antacid that neutralizes existing acid but does not inhibit secretion.",9
8991,"The patient is a 24-year-old woman with a Pap smear showing low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL). In women aged 21-24 with LSIL, the recommended management is to repeat cytology in 12 months rather than immediate colposcopy. This is because LSIL in this age group often resolves spontaneously, and the risk of progression to high-grade lesions is low. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to repeat the Pap smear in 12 months.",9
8995,"The patient's symptoms and family history suggest a diagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES), which is characterized by gastrin-secreting tumors (gastrinomas) leading to excessive gastric acid production. This results in recurrent peptic ulcers, often in atypical locations such as the distal duodenum, and can cause diarrhea due to acid inactivation of pancreatic enzymes. The family history of primary hyperparathyroidism and complications from hypoglycemia suggests Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), which includes gastrinomas, hyperparathyroidism, and pituitary tumors. In ZES, the excessive gastrin leads to parietal cell hyperplasia in the stomach due to the trophic effect of gastrin on these cells. Therefore, further evaluation is most likely to show parietal cell hyperplasia in the stomach.",9
9000,"The patient's symptoms are characteristic of migraine headaches. She experiences recurrent headaches that are unilateral (alternately affecting the right or left side), which is typical for migraines. The headaches are also associated with nausea and are exacerbated by loud sounds or bright light, which are common migraine triggers. Tension headaches are usually bilateral and not associated with nausea or sensitivity to light and sound. Trigeminal neuralgia involves sharp, stabbing facial pain rather than headaches. Cluster headaches are severe, unilateral, and often occur in clusters over weeks, but they are not typically associated with nausea or sensitivity to light and sound. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is migraine headache.",9
9001,"The patient's symptoms are indicative of angioedema, characterized by sudden facial swelling, abdominal pain, and intestinal wall thickening. The key details include the lack of pruritus, the history of similar episodes after trauma, and the recent dental procedure. These suggest a non-allergic cause. Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a likely diagnosis, which is due to a deficiency or dysfunction of C1 esterase inhibitor, leading to excess bradykinin. This condition is not related to histamine release, hence the absence of pruritus. The recurrent nature and the triggering by trauma or stress (like dental procedures) further support HAE. Therefore, the most likely cause is a complement inhibitor deficiency, specifically C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency.",9
8996,"The patient's presentation suggests a hereditary syndrome involving the thyroid. The family history of thyroid removal at a young age and the patient's symptoms of anxiety, headache, racing heart, and sweating are suggestive of pheochromocytoma, which is associated with MEN 2 syndromes. MEN 2A and 2B include medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and other features. The patient's tall stature and long extremities may also suggest Marfanoid habitus, which is associated with MEN 2B. Given these clues, the most likely thyroid pathology is medullary carcinoma, which is a component of MEN 2 syndromes.",9
9003,"The patient initially presented with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent PCI. Five days later, he presents with dizziness, lightheadedness, palpitations, hypotension, and an increased oxygen concentration in the pulmonary artery. These findings suggest a complication of myocardial infarction, specifically a ventricular septal rupture. This condition leads to a left-to-right shunt, causing increased oxygenation in the right side of the heart, particularly the pulmonary artery. A ventricular septal rupture typically presents with a harsh, loud, holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border due to the turbulent flow between the ventricles.",9
9002,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are suggestive of asthma, particularly allergic asthma. The elevated serum IgE levels and the presence of eosinophilic, hexagonal, double-pointed crystals (Charcot-Leyden crystals) in the sputum are indicative of eosinophilic inflammation, which is common in allergic asthma. A positive methacholine challenge test supports the diagnosis of asthma. Among the options, dust mites are a common allergen that can trigger allergic asthma. Aspirin can cause asthma exacerbations in aspirin-sensitive individuals, but it is not associated with elevated IgE or eosinophilic crystals. Cold air and tobacco smoke can trigger asthma symptoms but are not allergens that would cause elevated IgE levels. Therefore, exposure to dust mites is the most likely cause of this patient's condition.",9
9009,"The patient is experiencing a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, which is a common response to antibiotic treatment for syphilis. This reaction is characterized by fever, chills, headache, and worsening of skin lesions shortly after starting treatment. It is not an allergic reaction, so epinephrine is not indicated. The reaction is self-limiting and typically resolves within 24 hours. The most appropriate management is supportive care with antipyretics and analgesics to relieve symptoms. Prednisone is not necessary as this is not an allergic or inflammatory reaction requiring steroids. Doxycycline is not needed as the patient is already receiving appropriate treatment with penicillin.",9
8967,,0
9015,"The patient is experiencing oliguria (low urine output) following surgery, which is a common issue that can arise due to hypovolemia, especially after a major surgery like a proctocolectomy. The vital signs are relatively stable, but the low urine output and elevated blood urea nitrogen suggest possible pre-renal azotemia due to decreased renal perfusion. The urinary catheter is patent, ruling out mechanical obstruction. In this context, the most appropriate initial management step is to address potential hypovolemia by administering intravenous fluids to improve renal perfusion and increase urine output.",9
9017,"The patient has been diagnosed with metastatic colon cancer and is focusing on discussing literature, novel therapies, and statistical outcomes rather than addressing the emotional impact of his diagnosis. This behavior is indicative of using intellectualization as a defense mechanism. Intellectualization involves focusing on facts and logic to avoid dealing with the emotional distress of a situation. The patient is likely using this approach to cope with the anxiety and fear associated with his diagnosis.",9
9020,"The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, bloody mucoid diarrhea, fever, and tenderness in the left lower abdomen suggest diverticulitis, which is inflammation of diverticula in the colon. The CT scan likely shows findings consistent with diverticulitis, such as thickening of the bowel wall or inflammation around the colon. Diverticulitis is caused by inflammation or infection of diverticula, which are outpouchings of the colonic wall. These diverticula form due to focal weakness in the colonic muscularis layer, often exacerbated by increased intraluminal pressure. This condition is common in older adults and is associated with a low-fiber diet. The patient's history of constipation and use of supplements may also contribute to increased intraluminal pressure, leading to the formation of diverticula. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of the patient's condition is focal weakness of the colonic muscularis layer.",9
9007,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a lung abscess, likely due to aspiration given his chronic alcoholism and poor hygiene. The foul-smelling, blood-streaked sputum and the ill-defined circular lesion on the chest radiograph support this. The most common organisms involved in aspiration pneumonia leading to lung abscesses are anaerobic bacteria. 

Option A refers to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, where gastric washings and urine are not typically used for diagnosis. 

Option B describes the culture conditions for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is not the organism likely causing this patient's symptoms.

Option C compares staining methods for tuberculosis, but fluorescence microscopy with auramine-rhodamine stain is actually more sensitive than Ziehl-Neelsen staining.

Option D suggests that a positive tuberculin test is diagnostic of active infection, which is incorrect as it indicates exposure, not necessarily active disease.

Given the context of the question, the most likely diagnosis is related to anaerobic bacterial infection from aspiration, not tuberculosis. Therefore, none of the options directly apply to the most likely diagnosis of lung abscess due to anaerobic bacteria. However, considering the options given, B is the most factual statement regarding tuberculosis culture, even though it doesn't apply to this case.",9
9022,"The patient's presentation is consistent with angle-closure glaucoma. The sudden onset of severe periorbital pain, blurred vision, headache, and vomiting, along with the history of entering a dimly lit theater, suggests an acute increase in intraocular pressure. The physical examination findings of conjunctival injection, corneal edema, and a mid-dilated, non-reactive pupil are classic for angle-closure glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma typically presents with gradual vision loss and does not cause acute symptoms. Retrobulbar neuritis would present with vision loss and pain on eye movement, but not with corneal edema or a mid-dilated pupil. Acute iridocyclitis (anterior uveitis) would present with a constricted pupil and possibly photophobia, but not with the acute symptoms seen here.",9
9026,"The patient's symptoms and signs suggest a systemic condition, likely involving the heart. The fever, malaise, weight loss, and rash, along with the nontender erythematous macules on the palms and soles, are indicative of Janeway lesions. These are associated with infective endocarditis, which can cause microemboli to form and lodge in small vessels, leading to these skin findings. The photograph of the fingernail likely shows splinter hemorrhages, which are also associated with microemboli from endocarditis. Therefore, the microscopic examination of the nail lesion is most likely to show microemboli.",9
9028,"The genetic disorder described is likely Friedreich's ataxia, which is an autosomal recessive disorder. For an autosomal recessive disorder, a child must inherit two copies of the mutant allele, one from each parent, to be affected.

Given that the frequency of carriers (heterozygotes) in the population is 1/100, we can denote this as 2pq = 1/100, where p is the frequency of the normal allele and q is the frequency of the mutant allele.

Since 2pq = 1/100, we can solve for q^2, which represents the probability of a child being affected (homozygous recessive):

1. Calculate q: 2pq = 1/100 implies q ≈ 1/200 (since p ≈ 1 for rare alleles).
2. Calculate q^2: (1/200)^2 = 1/40,000.

Therefore, the probability that her child will develop the disease is 1/40,000.",9
9016,"The patient presents with symptoms and ultrasound findings suggestive of acute acalculous cholecystitis, a condition often seen in critically ill patients or those who have undergone major surgery. The absence of gallstones and the presence of a distended gallbladder with thickened walls and pericholecystic fluid support this diagnosis. The patient is also febrile and has leukocytosis, indicating an infection. Immediate cholecystectomy (option C) is not ideal in this setting due to the patient's recent major surgery and potential instability. Instead, the appropriate management involves addressing the infection and decompressing the gallbladder. Therefore, intravenous antibiotics (piperacillin-tazobactam) and percutaneous cholecystostomy (option D) are the most appropriate next steps.",9
9029,"The clinical presentation is consistent with anaphylaxis, which is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction. The symptoms include difficulty breathing, vomiting, hypotension, tachycardia, urticaria (hives), and wheezing. In cases of anaphylaxis, the most appropriate initial treatment is epinephrine. Epinephrine acts quickly to counteract the symptoms by causing vasoconstriction, bronchodilation, and increasing cardiac output, thereby addressing the hypotension, wheezing, and other systemic effects. Other treatments like corticosteroids (methylprednisolone) and vasopressors (norepinephrine) may be used later, but epinephrine is the first-line treatment.",10
9030,"The symptoms described in the question, such as difficulty walking, bone and joint pain, bowed legs, and hard lumps on the ribs, are indicative of rickets, which is commonly caused by a deficiency in vitamin D. Vitamin D is crucial for promoting intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate, which are essential for healthy bone formation. The question states that the patient is low in a substance that directly promotes intestinal absorption of a nutrient, which aligns with the role of vitamin D in calcium absorption. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, which matches option A. Options C and D refer to cells in the parathyroid gland, which are not related to vitamin D production. Therefore, the characteristic of the substance that is abnormally low in this patient is that it is a fat-soluble vitamin.",9
9036,"The patient presents with significant hemoptysis, weight loss, and a lung nodule, raising suspicion for a possible malignancy. The vital signs indicate hypotension and tachycardia, suggesting hemodynamic instability. In cases of massive hemoptysis, the priority is to secure the airway and ensure adequate oxygenation to prevent asphyxiation and respiratory failure. While identifying the source of bleeding and further diagnostic steps are important, the immediate management should focus on stabilizing the patient. Therefore, securing the airway and maintaining adequate oxygen saturation is the best initial step.",9
9037,"The clinical presentation of this patient suggests encephalitis, likely due to a viral infection such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis. The key features include fever, headache, altered mental status, and focal neurological deficits (dysphasia and ataxia). The absence of meningeal signs and photophobia makes bacterial meningitis less likely. The MRI findings, although not provided, would typically show temporal lobe involvement in HSV encephalitis. 

In viral encephalitis, the CSF findings typically show:
- Opening pressure: normal or slightly elevated
- Color: clear
- Protein: mildly elevated
- Cell count: elevated, predominantly lymphocytes
- CSF:blood glucose ratio: normal (around 0.6)

Option C matches these expected findings for viral encephalitis, with a clear color, mildly elevated protein, lymphocytic predominance, and a normal CSF:blood glucose ratio.",9
9033,"The clinical presentation described in the question is characteristic of Rett syndrome. Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder that primarily affects females and is associated with a period of normal development followed by a loss of acquired skills, particularly in language and motor abilities. The hand-wringing behavior is a classic sign of Rett syndrome. This condition is caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene, which is located on the X chromosome. The inheritance pattern of Rett syndrome is X-linked dominant. It predominantly affects females because males with the mutation often do not survive to term.",9
9044,"In this scenario, the patient has designated a medical durable power of attorney, which typically gives the designated person the authority to make healthcare decisions on behalf of the patient when they are unable to do so themselves. However, the patient also has a living will, which is a legal document that outlines their wishes regarding medical treatment in situations where they are unable to communicate their decisions. 

The living will specifically states that the patient wishes to be placed on life support until full recovery, which directly contradicts the decision of the medical power of attorney. In cases where there is a conflict between a living will and the decisions of a medical power of attorney, the living will generally takes precedence because it is a direct expression of the patient's wishes.

Therefore, the most appropriate course of action is to follow the patient's living will, as it provides clear instructions from the patient regarding their preferences for life support.",9
9045,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of achondroplasia, a common form of dwarfism characterized by disproportionate short stature, macrocephaly, and characteristic facial features. The narrowing of the interpedicular distance on spinal x-ray is also consistent with this diagnosis. The muscle weakness and hyperreflexia could indicate spinal cord compression, possibly due to foramen magnum stenosis, which is a known complication in achondroplasia. A CT scan of the head would help evaluate for this complication by assessing the foramen magnum and potential compression of neural structures. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to perform a CT scan of the head to assess for foramen magnum stenosis.",9
9046,"The patient is a 21-year-old primigravida at 16 weeks of gestation with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Her HbA1c is elevated at 8.3%, indicating suboptimal glucose control. In pregnant women, especially those with diabetes, it is crucial to monitor fetal development and screen for potential anomalies. The triple test, performed between 15-20 weeks of gestation, is a maternal blood screening test that assesses the risk of certain birth defects, including neural tube defects and chromosomal abnormalities. Given her diabetes and the gestational age, the triple test is highly recommended to assess the risk of fetal anomalies.",9
9049,"The patient is experiencing symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and the medication prescribed is likely a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, such as finasteride or dutasteride. These medications work by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is involved in prostate growth. 

Finasteride is also used to treat male pattern baldness (androgenetic alopecia) because DHT plays a role in hair follicle miniaturization, which leads to hair loss. 

Erectile dysfunction is not treated with 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. PCOS is not treated with these medications either. Prostate adenocarcinoma is not typically treated with 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, although they may have some role in prevention or risk reduction.

Therefore, the disorder that can also be treated with the medication prescribed for this patient is male pattern baldness.",9
9050,"The patient's symptoms and ultrasound findings are suggestive of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The excessive hair growth (hirsutism) is due to increased androgen production. In PCOS, the ovarian theca cells are responsible for the increased production of androgens, such as testosterone, which leads to hirsutism. Theca cells are stimulated by luteinizing hormone (LH) to produce androgens, which can then be converted to estrogens in the granulosa cells. However, in PCOS, there is an imbalance leading to excess androgen production. Therefore, the cells directly responsible for the excessive hair growth are the ovarian theca cells.",9
9051,"The patient's symptoms are characteristic of trigeminal neuralgia. He experiences sudden, severe, electric-like facial pain triggered by touch, such as shaving or applying lotion. This type of pain is typical for trigeminal neuralgia, which involves the trigeminal nerve and is often described as electric or shock-like. The pain is usually unilateral and can be triggered by light touch or even a breeze. The other options do not match the symptom profile: cluster headaches are associated with autonomic symptoms and occur in clusters, migraines are typically throbbing and can be associated with nausea and photophobia, and tension headaches are usually bilateral and pressing in nature.",9
9048,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest epididymitis, likely due to a sexually transmitted infection. The relief of pain upon lifting the testicle (Prehn's sign) is characteristic of epididymitis. The Gram stain shows numerous polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no organisms, which is typical for Chlamydia trachomatis because it is an intracellular organism that does not stain well with Gram stain. The patient's sexual history and lack of condom use further support a sexually transmitted infection, with Chlamydia trachomatis being a common cause in sexually active young men.",9
9052,"A supracondylar fracture of the humerus, especially with anterior displacement of the proximal fragment, can lead to complications involving the brachial artery and the median nerve. The most common concern is vascular injury, which can result in absent distal pulses. The brachial artery runs anterior to the humerus and can be compromised in such fractures, leading to absent distal radial pulse. Radial deviation of the wrist is associated with ulnar nerve injury, which is less likely in this scenario. Inability to abduct the shoulder is related to axillary nerve injury, and inability to flex the elbow is related to musculocutaneous nerve injury, neither of which are typically associated with supracondylar fractures.",9
9061,"The clinical presentation of the boy includes severe developmental delay, macroorchidism, hypertelorism, large protruding ears, a large jaw, and a long thin face. These features are characteristic of Fragile X syndrome. The genetic test results show an expansion of 250 repeats of CGG, which is associated with Fragile X syndrome. This condition is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome. The other options do not match the clinical presentation or the genetic findings. Huntington's disease is associated with CAG repeats, Myotonic dystrophy type 1 with CTG repeats, and Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy with CAG repeats.",10
9057,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of vascular insufficiency, including erectile dysfunction, claudication (pain in the lower back and thighs with exertion that resolves with rest), and a history of smoking and hypertension. These symptoms are consistent with peripheral artery disease (PAD), which is characterized by reduced blood flow to the extremities due to atherosclerosis. The lack of response to sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor used to treat erectile dysfunction, further suggests a vascular cause rather than a neurological or psychological one. Given these findings, decreased bilateral femoral pulses would be expected on physical examination due to reduced blood flow in the lower extremities.",9
8989,"Lowering the ELISA absorbance cutoff value means that more individuals will be classified as positive for Trypanosoma cruzi infection. This change will increase the number of true positive results, but it will also increase the number of false positive results because individuals who are not truly infected may now be classified as positive due to the lower threshold. 

Specificity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those without the disease (true negative rate). Lowering the cutoff will decrease specificity because more false positives will occur. 

Positive predictive value (PPV) is the proportion of positive test results that are true positives. Lowering the cutoff can decrease the PPV because the increase in false positives will reduce the proportion of true positives among those who test positive.

Negative predictive value (NPV) is the proportion of negative test results that are true negatives. Since the cutoff is lowered, more true positives are detected, which means fewer false negatives. This change can increase the NPV if the number of true negatives remains high relative to false negatives.

Therefore, the most likely outcome of lowering the cutoff is an increased negative predictive value.",7
9062,"The patient is a 13-year-old African-American boy with a history of pain episodes requiring hospitalization, which suggests a history of sickle cell disease. The current symptoms include groin and buttock pain, tenderness over the lateral aspect of the left hip, and pain with passive abduction and internal rotation. The absence of swelling, warmth, or erythema, along with a normal leukocyte count, makes septic arthritis less likely. Proximal femoral osteosarcoma would typically present with a mass and more systemic symptoms. Transient synovitis is usually self-limiting and occurs in younger children. Given the history of sickle cell disease, avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head is a common complication due to vaso-occlusive crises leading to bone infarction. Therefore, the most likely cause of the symptoms is avascular necrosis.",9
9064,"The patient presents with symptoms of anxiety, including tremor, restlessness, and difficulty sleeping due to worry. These symptoms are exacerbated by stressors such as upcoming concerts and walking in the city, indicating a persistent pattern of anxiety. The symptoms have been present for 8 months, which is significant for a chronic condition. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive anxiety and worry occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities. The patient's symptoms align with GAD, as she experiences anxiety in various situations, not limited to specific events, and it affects her daily functioning. The other options do not fit as well: Adjustment disorder is related to a specific stressor and typically resolves within 6 months after the stressor ends; Panic disorder involves discrete episodes of intense fear; Atypical depressive disorder involves mood disturbances with atypical features, which are not present here.",9
9067,"The patient is a pregnant woman with acute liver failure symptoms, including jaundice, elevated liver enzymes, and coagulopathy, after returning from South Asia. The symptoms and travel history suggest a viral hepatitis infection. Hepatitis E is known to cause severe disease, particularly in pregnant women, and is endemic in South Asia. The presence of jaundice, elevated liver enzymes, and the acute nature of the illness point towards an acute viral hepatitis infection. Among the options, anti-HEV IgM is indicative of an acute Hepatitis E infection, which aligns with the patient's travel history and clinical presentation.",9
9072,"The newborn presents with bilious vomiting and a distended upper abdomen shortly after birth. The x-ray shows 3 distinct, localized gas collections in the upper abdomen and a gasless distal abdomen. This pattern is indicative of the ""triple bubble"" sign, which is characteristic of jejunal atresia. Duodenal atresia typically presents with a ""double bubble"" sign and is associated with Down syndrome. Meconium ileus is associated with cystic fibrosis and presents with a different x-ray pattern. Hirschsprung disease usually presents later with failure to pass meconium and abdominal distension, not immediately after birth with bilious vomiting. The history of polyhydramnios also supports a diagnosis of intestinal atresia, as it can be associated with bowel obstructions.",9
9066,"The patient's ECG findings of a short PR interval and a wide QRS complex with initial slurring are characteristic of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. This condition is caused by the presence of an accessory atrioventricular pathway, known as the bundle of Kent, which allows electrical impulses to bypass the AV node and directly activate the ventricles. This results in the characteristic ECG changes and can lead to episodes of tachycardia, palpitations, and syncope due to reentrant tachycardia circuits. The normal serum glucose level and normal echocardiographic findings further support that the underlying issue is related to the electrical conduction system rather than metabolic or structural heart problems.",9
9074,"In the context of assessing fetal lung maturity, the lecithin:sphingomyelin (L:S) ratio is a key indicator. Lecithin (also known as phosphatidylcholine) is a component of surfactant, which is crucial for reducing surface tension in the alveoli and preventing neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Sphingomyelin is a phospholipid that remains relatively constant during gestation. As the fetus matures, the production of lecithin increases, leading to a higher L:S ratio. An L:S ratio of 2:1 or greater is generally considered indicative of mature fetal lungs, while a ratio less than 1.5 suggests a high risk of RDS. Therefore, the most predictive ratio for the infant having pulmonary distress would be an L:S ratio less than 1.5.",9
9083,"The patient presents with several key features: short stature, anemia, thrombocytopenia, electrolyte imbalances, and physical abnormalities such as short thumbs and skin pigmentation changes. The anemia is macrocytic (MCV 105 μm3), and there is pancytopenia (low hemoglobin and platelet count). The presence of hyperpigmented and hypopigmented patches, short stature, and skeletal abnormalities like pectus carinatum and short thumbs are suggestive of a genetic syndrome. The electrolyte imbalances and metabolic acidosis (low bicarbonate and low pH) with normal anion gap suggest renal tubular dysfunction. These findings are consistent with Fanconi anemia, a genetic disorder characterized by bone marrow failure, congenital abnormalities, and increased risk of malignancies. Diamond-Blackfan anemia typically presents with pure red cell aplasia and does not explain the thrombocytopenia or electrolyte imbalances. Neurofibromatosis type 1 is associated with café-au-lait spots and neurofibromas, not the hematological and electrolyte findings seen here. Rickets would present with bone deformities and possibly hypophosphatemia, but not with the hematological findings.",9
9077,"The patient's symptoms and findings suggest a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The key points include the presence of a high proliferative index and CD20 positivity, which indicates a B-cell lymphoma. The massively enlarged lymph nodes and systemic symptoms (fatigue, weight loss, night sweats) are consistent with an aggressive lymphoma. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a common aggressive B-cell lymphoma that presents with rapidly enlarging lymph nodes and systemic symptoms. The histopathology showing a high proliferative index supports this diagnosis. Marginal zone lymphoma and follicular lymphoma are typically indolent and would not present with such aggressive symptoms. Hairy cell leukemia is a chronic leukemia with different clinical and laboratory features.",9
9087,"To assess incidence, a study design that follows a group over time to see who develops the disease is needed. A prospective cohort study is ideal for this because it starts with a population free of the disease and follows them over time to observe new cases, thus measuring incidence. 

To assess prevalence, a study design that captures a snapshot of the population at a single point in time is needed. A cross-sectional study is ideal for this because it measures both existing and new cases at one point in time, thus providing prevalence data.

Therefore, the best pair of studies to assess incidence and prevalence are a prospective cohort study for incidence and a cross-sectional study for prevalence.",10
9088,"The patient developed symptoms of cyanide toxicity after being treated with sodium nitroprusside, which can release cyanide as a byproduct. Symptoms of cyanide toxicity include confusion, abdominal pain, flushing, metabolic acidosis, and elevated lactic acid. The treatment for cyanide toxicity involves agents that can bind cyanide. Hydroxycobalamin directly binds cyanide to form cyanocobalamin, which is then excreted in the urine. This makes hydroxycobalamin the appropriate treatment for the patient's symptoms.",9
9094,"The patient initially presents with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, likely due to Graves' disease, given the ocular symptoms that developed after radioactive iodine ablation. The ocular symptoms, such as proptosis and diplopia, are due to Graves' ophthalmopathy, which is an autoimmune condition characterized by inflammation and swelling of the extraocular muscles and retro-orbital tissues. The treatment that improves these ocular symptoms is likely targeting the inflammatory process. Glucocorticoids are commonly used to reduce inflammation and decrease the production of proinflammatory cytokines, which would alleviate the symptoms of proptosis and diplopia.",9
9076,"The patient, who has a history of Alzheimer dementia, presents with confusion, fever, and signs of delirium. Initially, his confusion improves with IV fluids and acetaminophen, suggesting a possible acute infection, likely a urinary tract infection given the high post-void residual volume. However, after being given sedation and placed in restraints, his mental status worsens significantly, becoming more aggressive and combative. This change in behavior is consistent with anticholinergic delirium, which can be caused by medications with anticholinergic properties. Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine with strong anticholinergic effects, is known to cause such delirium, especially in the elderly. Haloperidol and olanzapine are antipsychotics that can also cause delirium, but the presentation is more typical of anticholinergic toxicity. Therefore, the most likely cause of the recent worsening in mental status is the administration of diphenhydramine.",9
9091,"The patient presents with sudden onset of right-sided weakness, suggesting a stroke. The initial CT scan is unremarkable, which is common in ischemic strokes early on. The repeat CT scan a month later shows lesions, likely indicating lacunar infarcts. The patient's history of poorly controlled hypertension and diabetes increases the risk for small vessel disease, leading to lacunar strokes. Hyaline arteriosclerosis is a common cause of small vessel disease in the brain, leading to lacunar infarcts. Charcot-Bouchard aneurysms are associated with hemorrhagic strokes, not ischemic ones. Carotid artery atherosclerosis typically causes larger territorial infarcts, not lacunar ones. Hypertensive encephalopathy presents with diffuse cerebral dysfunction, not focal deficits. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is hyaline arteriosclerosis causing lacunar infarcts.",9
9093,"The patient is experiencing nausea and vomiting due to stimulation of the area postrema, a region in the brain located on the floor of the fourth ventricle. The area postrema is part of the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) and lacks a blood-brain barrier, allowing it to detect emetic agents in the blood. The blood-brain barrier is characterized by tight junctions, which are composed of proteins such as claudins and occludins. The absence of these tight junctions in the area postrema allows chemotherapeutic agents to stimulate this region, leading to nausea and vomiting.",10
9096,"The scenario presented involves a young child with a femur fracture and a bruise, which are concerning for non-accidental trauma (child abuse). The history provided by the mother is inconsistent with the severity of the injury, and the child’s reluctance to speak about the incident raises further suspicion. In cases of suspected child abuse, it is crucial to assess for other potential injuries that may not be immediately apparent. A complete skeletal survey is a standard procedure to identify any additional fractures or injuries that might indicate a pattern of abuse. Additionally, it is a legal and ethical obligation to report suspected child abuse to the appropriate authorities for further investigation. Therefore, the next best step in management is to obtain a complete skeletal survey and report the case as a potential child abuse situation.",9
9103,"The patient's symptoms and lab findings suggest a cholestatic liver disease. She has fatigue, pruritus, scleral icterus, and elevated alkaline phosphatase with direct hyperbilirubinemia. The absence of abnormalities on the ultrasound suggests an intrahepatic cause rather than an obstruction. Her history of celiac disease and eye symptoms (possibly sicca symptoms) could indicate an autoimmune process. Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune liver disease that fits this presentation, and the next best step to confirm this diagnosis is to check for anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA), which are highly specific for PBC.",9
9109,"The patient presents with hyperpigmented patches on her face, particularly on the cheeks and forehead, which is characteristic of melasma. Melasma is often associated with hormonal changes and can be exacerbated by sun exposure. The patient's use of oral contraceptives is a significant clue, as these can lead to hormonal changes that trigger melasma. The negative ANA and lack of other systemic symptoms make autoimmune causes less likely. Enzyme inhibition and hypersensitivity reactions are not typical causes of melasma. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is her medication, specifically the oral contraceptives.",9
9110,"The clinical presentation and findings in this case are suggestive of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). The key features include the diffuse erythematous papular rash, recurrent otitis media, cervical lymphadenopathy, and the presence of lytic bone lesions. The electron microscopy finding of cells with organelles shaped like tennis rackets (Birbeck granules) and positive staining for S-100 are characteristic of Langerhans cells. Langerhans cells are a type of dendritic cell involved in antigen presentation and are known to proliferate in LCH, leading to the symptoms and findings described.",9
9102,"The patient's symptoms and physical findings suggest Cushing's syndrome. She has weight gain, hypertension, irregular menstrual cycles, hirsutism, acne, and a rounded, reddened face, which are indicative of excess cortisol. Cushing's syndrome is associated with decreased bone mineral density due to the catabolic effects of cortisol on bone. The other options do not align with the symptoms and findings: increased serum erythropoietin is not related to Cushing's syndrome, discoloration of the corneal margin is associated with Wilson's disease, and enlarged ovaries with multiple follicles suggest polycystic ovary syndrome, which does not explain the bruising and facial changes.",9
9114,"The child has a holosystolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border, which is characteristic of a ventricular septal defect (VSD). In VSD, blood flows from the left ventricle to the right ventricle, leading to increased blood flow to the pulmonary circulation. Over time, this can cause pulmonary hypertension due to increased pressure and volume load on the pulmonary vasculature. If left untreated, the increased pressure can lead to irreversible changes in the pulmonary arteries, such as intimal hyperplasia and medial hypertrophy, eventually resulting in Eisenmenger syndrome. Therefore, the structure most likely to undergo irreversible changes is the pulmonary artery.",10
9124,"The patient presents with signs and symptoms suggestive of compartment syndrome in the right leg following a bike accident. Key findings include severe pain, swelling, pallor, cool skin, weak pulses, prolonged capillary refill, and pain on dorsiflexion of the foot. These symptoms indicate increased pressure within the muscle compartments of the leg, leading to compromised circulation and nerve function. The most appropriate immediate management for compartment syndrome is surgical intervention to relieve the pressure, which is achieved through a fasciotomy.",9
9123,"The patient presents with symptoms and CT findings consistent with acute diverticulitis complicated by an abscess. The CT scan shows a 5.5-cm pelvic fluid collection, which is likely an abscess. In cases of diverticulitis with an abscess, the size of the abscess determines the management approach. Abscesses larger than 3 cm typically require drainage. CT-guided percutaneous drainage is the preferred method for abscesses of this size, as it is less invasive than surgical options and can effectively manage the abscess. Observation and serial CT scans are not appropriate due to the size of the abscess. Surgical options like hemicolectomy or segmental resection are considered if percutaneous drainage fails or if there are other complications.",9
9119,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of infective endocarditis, including fever, a diastolic murmur, and vegetation on the aortic valve. The presence of track marks indicates intravenous drug use, which is a significant risk factor for infective endocarditis. In IV drug users, the most common causative organism of infective endocarditis is Staphylococcus aureus. This organism is known for its ability to cause acute endocarditis and is often associated with right-sided heart involvement, but it can also affect the left side, as seen in this patient with aortic valve involvement. The presence of a lesion on the finger could suggest embolic phenomena, which are common in endocarditis. The other organisms listed are less commonly associated with IV drug use and acute presentations. Viridans group streptococci are more common in subacute endocarditis following dental procedures. Kingella kingae is more common in children, and Streptococcus gallolyticus is associated with colorectal cancer. Therefore, Staphylococcus aureus is the most likely causative agent in this scenario.",9
9129,"The patient is Rh-negative (A-) and her husband is Rh-positive (O+), which puts her at risk for Rh incompatibility. If the fetus is Rh-positive, the mother could develop antibodies against the Rh antigen, leading to hemolytic disease of the newborn in future pregnancies. To prevent this, Rh-negative mothers are given anti-RhO(D) immunoglobulin (RhoGAM) at around 28 weeks of gestation and within 72 hours after delivery if the baby is Rh-positive. This patient has not received any prenatal care, so she likely has not received RhoGAM yet. Therefore, administering anti-RhO(D) immunoglobulin is crucial to prevent sensitization.",9
9128,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs consistent with acute pericarditis, likely post-myocardial infarction (Dressler's syndrome). The sharp chest pain that worsens with inspiration and coughing, along with the pericardial friction rub and diffuse ST elevations on ECG, support this diagnosis. The fever and recent cardiac catheterization further suggest an inflammatory process. The most appropriate treatment for acute pericarditis, especially post-MI, is to increase the dose of aspirin, as NSAIDs like ibuprofen are typically avoided in the early post-MI period due to potential interference with myocardial healing.",9
9126,"The patient's symptoms of hoarseness and dysphagia, along with significant weight loss, are concerning for a malignancy. His 60-pack-year smoking history is a significant risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region, including the larynx and esophagus. The absence of symptoms like heartburn or regurgitation makes gastroesophageal reflux disease less likely, which would be more associated with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Chronic autoimmune gastritis typically presents with different symptoms, such as anemia or vitamin B12 deficiency, and reduced lower esophageal pressure is more related to conditions like GERD, which doesn't fit the presentation. Therefore, the most likely cause of his symptoms is a malignant proliferation of squamous cells, likely in the larynx or esophagus.",9
9137,"The patient is experiencing palpitations and dizziness, and the ECG likely shows a supraventricular tachycardia. The drug administered is a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, which primarily affects the heart by slowing conduction through the AV node. These drugs, such as verapamil or diltiazem, work by inhibiting calcium channels in the cardiac tissue, particularly affecting the AV node. This results in a prolongation of AV node repolarization, which helps to control the heart rate and improve symptoms in conditions like atrial fibrillation or other supraventricular tachycardias. Therefore, the effect of the drug on the cardiac conduction system is the prolongation of AV node repolarization.",9
9131,"The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a significant weight loss, cough, fatigue, and hemoptysis. The chest X-ray shows a coin-shaped lesion in the periphery of the lung. The peripheral location of the lesion is a key detail. Among the types of lung cancer, adenocarcinoma is most commonly found in the peripheral regions of the lung. Additionally, adenocarcinoma is the most common type of lung cancer in non-smokers and women. The other types of lung cancer, such as squamous cell carcinoma, are more centrally located and often associated with smoking. Mesothelioma is associated with asbestos exposure and typically involves the pleura rather than presenting as a solitary lung nodule. Large cell carcinoma can be peripheral but is less common than adenocarcinoma. Given the patient's demographics and the lesion's characteristics, adenocarcinoma is the most likely diagnosis.",9
9139,"The patient presents with symptoms and lab findings suggestive of acute liver failure, likely due to alcohol abuse or drug-induced liver injury. The elevated AST and ALT levels, jaundice, and coagulopathy (elevated PT and PTT) indicate significant liver dysfunction. The thrombocytopenia could be due to hypersplenism or direct liver damage. Among the options, acetaminophen overdose is a common cause of acute liver failure. Given the patient's history of stress and increased substance use, it's plausible that he may have taken excessive acetaminophen for severe migraine headaches, leading to hepatotoxicity.",9
9143,"The patient's presentation of pruritic, clustered vesicular lesions on the elbows and knees is suggestive of dermatitis herpetiformis. This condition is strongly associated with celiac disease, which is characterized by gluten sensitivity and can lead to malabsorption due to damage to the small intestinal villi. The other options are less likely to be associated with this presentation: transmural inflammation of the colon is associated with Crohn's disease, erythema nodosum can be associated with various conditions but not specifically with dermatitis herpetiformis, and acanthosis nigricans is associated with insulin resistance and other conditions but not with dermatitis herpetiformis. Therefore, the most likely association is malabsorption due to celiac disease.",9
9147,"The clinical presentation suggests recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in a young girl, which raises suspicion for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), a condition where urine flows backward from the bladder into the ureters/kidneys. The presence of hydronephrosis and scarring on ultrasonography further supports this suspicion. A voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) is the most appropriate next step to evaluate for VUR, as it is the definitive test to diagnose this condition. While a urine culture and sensitivity (option C) is important for managing the current infection, the question asks for the next step in evaluating the underlying cause of recurrent UTIs and kidney damage.",9
9153,"The patient is a 75-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease and a transient ischemic attack, indicating significant atherosclerotic disease. His blood pressure was previously controlled with an ACE inhibitor, but now he presents with significantly elevated blood pressure and an increase in creatinine levels. This suggests a possible renal cause for the hypertension. Renal artery stenosis, particularly due to atherosclerosis, is a common cause of secondary hypertension in older patients and can lead to worsening renal function when an ACE inhibitor is used, as it reduces glomerular filtration pressure in the setting of reduced renal perfusion. Coarctation of the aorta is unlikely in this age group and would typically present earlier in life. Pheochromocytoma and hypothyroidism are less likely given the acute change in renal function and the patient's age and history. Therefore, the most likely cause of his hypertension is renal artery stenosis.",9
9150,"The patient presents with a sudden, severe headache described as the worst he has ever experienced, along with neck stiffness. These symptoms raise suspicion for a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Before performing a lumbar puncture, which could be dangerous if there is increased intracranial pressure, a CT scan of the head is necessary to rule out any intracranial bleeding or mass effect. Therefore, the next best step is to perform a CT head to check for SAH or other intracranial pathology.",9
9154,"Polyarteritis nodosa is a systemic vasculitis that affects medium-sized muscular arteries. It is associated with hepatitis B and C infections, and the pathogenesis involves the deposition of immune complexes in the vessel walls. This leads to complement activation, inflammation, and necrosis of the vessel wall. The immune complex deposition is characteristic of a Type III hypersensitivity reaction, where antigen-antibody complexes trigger an inflammatory response.",9
9156,"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest right-sided heart failure. The jugular venous distention, pitting edema, ascites (indicated by shifting dullness), and tender hepatomegaly are consistent with this diagnosis. The holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border that increases with inspiration is characteristic of tricuspid regurgitation. A common cause of tricuspid regurgitation in a young adult is infective endocarditis, particularly in intravenous drug users, due to the introduction of bacteria into the bloodstream and subsequent infection of the tricuspid valve. Therefore, the most likely predisposing factor for this patient's condition is intravenous drug use.",9
9157,"The question asks for a polysaccharide vaccine that is not conjugated to a protein. Let's evaluate the options:

A. Hib vaccine - This is a conjugate vaccine, not a polysaccharide vaccine.

B. Live attenuated influenza vaccine - This is a live attenuated vaccine, not a polysaccharide vaccine.

C. Menactra - This is a conjugate vaccine for meningococcal disease, not a polysaccharide vaccine.

D. Pneumovax - This is a polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) that is not conjugated to a protein. It is often given to individuals with certain conditions, such as sickle cell disease, to protect against pneumococcal infections.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Pneumovax.",9
9160,"The patient presents with acute onset of speech difficulties and right-sided weakness, consistent with a left middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke. The CT scan shows a hyperdensity in the left MCA, suggesting a thrombus. The rapid improvement of symptoms after pharmacotherapy suggests the use of a thrombolytic agent. Alteplase, a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), is used in acute ischemic stroke to dissolve clots and restore blood flow. The absence of intracranial bleeding on the CT scan makes the use of alteplase appropriate. Rivaroxaban, heparin, and warfarin are anticoagulants, not thrombolytics, and would not cause rapid symptom resolution in this context.",9
9169,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a liver pathology. The key findings include dark urine, pale stools, jaundice (indicated by elevated bilirubin levels), and hepatosplenomegaly. The liver function tests show a disproportionately high AST compared to ALT, which is unusual but can occur in certain conditions. The presence of anti-smooth muscle antibodies is a significant clue, as these are commonly associated with autoimmune hepatitis. The elevated globulin level and low albumin level further support this diagnosis, as they indicate an ongoing inflammatory process with possible liver dysfunction. The negative serology for hepatitis C and D rules out viral hepatitis as a cause. The presence of telangiectasias and the patient's age and gender also align with autoimmune hepatitis, which is more common in young women. Primary biliary cholangitis typically presents with positive anti-mitochondrial antibodies, not anti-smooth muscle antibodies. Primary sclerosing cholangitis is more common in men and often associated with inflammatory bowel disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency would not typically present with these serological findings. Therefore, the most likely cause is autoimmune hepatitis.",9
9161,"The patient is likely pregnant, as indicated by the missed period, morning nausea, breast changes, and uterine enlargement. During pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, there is an increased demand for thyroid hormones due to increased levels of thyroid-binding globulin and the effects of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which can stimulate the thyroid. Women with hypothyroidism often need an increase in their levothyroxine dose to maintain euthyroid status during pregnancy. The current thyroid panel shows that she is euthyroid, but to maintain this status throughout pregnancy, an increase in levothyroxine is typically required. The standard recommendation is to increase the dose by 20%–30% as soon as pregnancy is confirmed.",9
9171,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest acute decompensated heart failure, likely with pulmonary edema. The presence of an S3 heart sound, crackles, and wheezes, along with orthopnea, supports this diagnosis. In such cases, diuretics are commonly used to relieve symptoms by reducing fluid overload. The most effective diuretics for rapid fluid removal are loop diuretics, such as furosemide, which act on the ascending loop of Henle. Therefore, the site of action of the drug used to relieve this patient's symptoms is the ascending loop of Henle.",10
9173,"The patient is a 31-year-old woman with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) on her Pap smear and a positive high-risk HPV DNA test. According to current guidelines, when ASC-US is found with a positive high-risk HPV test, the next step is to perform a colposcopy to further evaluate the cervical epithelium for any potential lesions that may require treatment. This is because the presence of high-risk HPV increases the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and colposcopy allows for direct visualization and biopsy of any suspicious areas.",9
9172,"The patient is a 30-year-old woman at 28 weeks' gestation with a history of bipolar disorder, hypothyroidism, and cocaine use. Her medications include quetiapine and levothyroxine. The key risk factor here is her cocaine use, which is known to cause vasoconstriction and can lead to complications such as placental abruption (premature placental separation). The other options are less likely given the information: aplasia cutis congenita is associated with methimazole use, neural tube defects are related to folic acid deficiency (which she is taking), and shoulder dystocia is related to fetal macrosomia, which is not indicated here. Therefore, the fetus is at greatest risk of premature placental separation due to cocaine use.",9
9177,"The patient is on a regimen that includes sirolimus, tacrolimus, and prednisolone. The biopsy shows tubular vacuolization without parenchymal changes, which is a key finding. Tacrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor known to cause nephrotoxicity, which often presents as tubular vacuolization on biopsy. Sirolimus, on the other hand, is less commonly associated with nephrotoxicity and typically does not cause tubular vacuolization. Prednisolone is a corticosteroid and does not typically cause this type of renal injury. Preformed antibody-mediated rejection would show different histological findings, such as glomerulitis or peritubular capillaritis, rather than isolated tubular vacuolization. Therefore, the most likely cause of the renal injury in this patient is tacrolimus toxicity.",9
9168,,0
9189,"The patient's symptoms of chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia, along with the lateral displacement of the cervix, are suggestive of endometriosis. Endometriosis is often diagnosed based on clinical suspicion, but definitive diagnosis requires direct visualization of endometrial implants. Imaging studies like ultrasound and MRI can help rule out other conditions but are not definitive for endometriosis. Hysteroscopy is used for intrauterine pathologies and is not helpful here. Laparoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis as it allows for direct visualization and potential biopsy of endometrial implants.",9
9187,"The patient is exhibiting symptoms of tardive dyskinesia, which are characterized by involuntary movements such as lip smacking and tongue movements. Tardive dyskinesia is a known side effect of long-term use of dopamine receptor blocking agents, particularly metoclopramide. Metoclopramide is a prokinetic agent used to treat gastroparesis and works by blocking dopamine receptors. None of the other medications listed (aspirin, gabapentin, glyburide) are associated with causing these types of involuntary movements.",9
9185,"The patient is presenting with signs of septic shock, likely due to a gram-positive bacterial infection. The arterial blood gas shows a pH of 7.29, indicating acidemia, and a low bicarbonate level (HCO3- of 14), suggesting a metabolic acidosis. The low pCO2 (28) indicates a compensatory respiratory alkalosis. In sepsis, there is often increased production of lactic acid due to tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxia, leading to lactic acidosis. This results in increased conversion of pyruvate to lactate, which is catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase. Therefore, the activity of lactate dehydrogenase would be increased, not decreased. Pyruvate dehydrogenase activity is decreased in this setting because pyruvate is being shunted towards lactate production rather than entering the mitochondria for aerobic metabolism. Thus, the correct statement about this patient's biochemical state is decreased activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase.",9
9192,"The patient presents with symptoms of dry mouth (xerostomia) and dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca), which are indicative of Sjögren's syndrome. This condition is characterized by autoimmune destruction of exocrine glands, particularly the salivary and lacrimal glands. The patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune condition, further supports the likelihood of Sjögren's syndrome. The increased incidence of dental cavities is also consistent with reduced saliva production due to glandular destruction. Uncontrolled blood glucose levels (A) could cause dry mouth but would not explain the dry eyes or the sudden increase in cavities. Obstruction of salivary ducts (B) would not cause dry eyes. Poor hygiene due to inability to care for self (D) is unlikely given the specific symptoms and the patient's ability to seek medical care.",9
9195,"The patient's presentation is consistent with bullous pemphigoid, which is characterized by pruritic, tense bullae that do not slough off with gentle rubbing (negative Nikolsky sign). This condition is caused by autoantibodies against hemidesmosomes, which are located at the dermoepidermal junction. Immunofluorescence studies in bullous pemphigoid typically show linear deposition of IgG and C3 at the dermoepidermal junction.",9
9190,"The study described involves enrolling subjects and following them over time to observe the development of Alzheimer's disease. This indicates a prospective design, as the subjects are monitored into the future from the point of enrollment. The study does not involve looking back at past records or data, which would characterize a retrospective study. Additionally, the study is observational because it involves observing outcomes without manipulating any variables. Therefore, it is a prospective observational study. 

Option A is incorrect because the study is not retrospective; it follows subjects forward in time. 
Option B is incorrect because observational studies cannot establish causation, only associations. 
Option D is incorrect because a case-control study involves identifying subjects with and without an outcome and looking back to find exposure differences, which is not the design here.

Thus, the most correct answer is C, as it accurately describes the study design.",9
9201,"The patient has treatment-resistant schizophrenia, as indicated by her multiple hospitalizations and failure to respond to several antipsychotic medications. Clozapine is often used for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. The laboratory findings show a significantly low leukocyte count with a very low percentage of neutrophils, indicating agranulocytosis. Agranulocytosis is a known side effect of clozapine, which requires regular monitoring of the white blood cell count. The improvement in her symptoms after starting the new medication also supports the use of clozapine, as it is effective in cases where other antipsychotics have failed.",10
9196,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The key features include the malar rash (red rash over the nose and cheeks), pleuritic chest pain, joint pain, fever, weight loss, anemia, and leukopenia. In SLE, the most specific antibody is the anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody. While other antibodies like anti-Smith are also specific, anti-dsDNA is more commonly tested and is associated with disease activity, particularly renal involvement. The other options are less specific for SLE: anti-microsomal antibodies are associated with thyroid conditions, anti-phospholipid antibodies are associated with antiphospholipid syndrome, and anti-ribonucleoprotein antibodies are associated with mixed connective tissue disease.",9
9203,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with an acute allergic reaction following a bee sting, characterized by immediate onset of rash, swelling, itching, hypotension, tachycardia, and respiratory distress (stridor). These symptoms suggest anaphylaxis, which is a classic example of a Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction. Type 1 hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by IgE antibodies that trigger mast cell degranulation and release of histamine and other mediators, leading to the symptoms observed. Type 3 hypersensitivity involves immune complex deposition, and Type 4 is a delayed-type hypersensitivity mediated by T cells, neither of which fit the acute presentation seen here. Therefore, the correct answer is Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction.",9
9204,"The patient presents with signs of lithium toxicity, including altered mental status, tremor, hyperreflexia, and nystagmus. His lithium level is significantly elevated at 6.8 mEq/L. In cases of severe lithium toxicity, especially with levels above 4.0 mEq/L and neurological symptoms, hemodialysis is indicated to rapidly remove lithium from the body. Gastric lavage is not effective for lithium overdose due to the time elapsed and lithium's absorption characteristics. Naloxone is used for opioid overdose, but the patient's symptoms and elevated lithium level point to lithium toxicity. Sodium bicarbonate is used for certain drug toxicities like tricyclic antidepressants, not lithium. Therefore, the next step in management is hemodialysis.",9
9151,,0
9202,"The patient's symptoms and radiographic findings are suggestive of ankylosing spondylitis, a type of seronegative spondyloarthropathy. The key features include chronic lower back pain that is worse in the morning and improves with activity, as well as bilateral sacroiliitis. The recent episode of right eye pain and blurry vision could indicate anterior uveitis, which is commonly associated with ankylosing spondylitis. 

The first-line treatment for ankylosing spondylitis is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to help reduce inflammation and pain. Indomethacin is a type of NSAID and is often used in the management of ankylosing spondylitis. 

Methotrexate and cyclophosphamide are not typically used for ankylosing spondylitis; methotrexate is more commonly used for rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune conditions, while cyclophosphamide is used for severe autoimmune diseases and certain cancers. Bed rest is not recommended as it can worsen the stiffness associated with ankylosing spondylitis.

Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for this patient is indomethacin.",9
9213,"The patient is a young woman with a newly discovered breast mass. In women under 30, breast ultrasound is typically the first imaging modality used to evaluate a breast mass because it can differentiate between solid and cystic masses and is more appropriate for younger women with denser breast tissue. Mammography is generally reserved for women over 30 or if there is a high suspicion of malignancy. Mastectomy is not indicated without a confirmed diagnosis of cancer. Reassurance alone is not appropriate given the presence of a palpable mass that needs further evaluation.",9
9209,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are suggestive of osteoarthritis (OA). The key features include pain and stiffness in the knee, particularly worse in the evening, and stiffness lasting less than 30 minutes in the morning. The patient's obesity (BMI of 33 kg/m2) is a risk factor for OA. Examination reveals tenderness and crepitus, which are common in OA. The laboratory findings show a normal ESR and a slightly elevated uric acid level, but these are not specific for gout or inflammatory arthritis. Imaging in OA typically shows osteophytes and joint space narrowing due to cartilage loss and bone remodeling. Other options like marginal bony erosions and periarticular opacification are more indicative of gout, while bony ankylosis and enthesitis are associated with spondyloarthropathies. Loculated cysts are more characteristic of conditions like subchondral cysts in OA, but the classic finding is osteophytes and joint space narrowing.",9
9224,"The patient presents with hypotension, bradycardia, and a history of ingesting migraine medication. These symptoms are suggestive of beta-blocker overdose, as some migraine medications, such as propranolol, are beta-blockers. In cases of beta-blocker overdose, glucagon is used as an antidote because it increases intracellular cyclic AMP, bypassing the beta-adrenergic receptor, and helps improve heart rate and blood pressure. Insulin is not relevant here, as there is no indication of hypoglycemia or diabetes-related issues. Beta-agonists could theoretically counteract beta-blocker effects but are not the primary treatment. N-Acetylcysteine is used for acetaminophen overdose, which is not indicated in this scenario.",9
9205,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are key to identifying the correct diagnosis. She has pain on the lateral side of the hip that radiates towards the thigh, which is aggravated by activities like climbing stairs and lying on the affected side. The tenderness is localized over the upper lateral part of the thigh, and pain is reproduced by abducting the leg against resistance. These findings are characteristic of greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), which involves the tendons and bursae around the greater trochanter. 

Iliotibial band syndrome typically presents with lateral knee pain, not hip pain. Lumbosacral radiculopathy would likely present with neurological symptoms such as numbness or weakness, and the pain would not be localized to the greater trochanter. Osteonecrosis of the femoral head would likely show abnormalities on an x-ray and present with more joint-specific symptoms.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is greater trochanteric pain syndrome.",9
9218,"The patient is a young military recruit with symptoms of fever, non-productive cough, headache, and ear pain, along with findings of rhonchi and nodular opacities on chest X-ray. These symptoms and findings are suggestive of atypical pneumonia. The presence of low titers of cold agglutinins is a key clue, as this is commonly associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is known to cause atypical pneumonia, especially in young adults and those in close living quarters, such as military recruits. The other organisms listed do not typically present with cold agglutinins or the specific clinical picture described.",9
9230,"During pregnancy, several physiological changes occur to accommodate the growing fetus. These include decreased systemic vascular resistance, increased cardiac output, and often a decrease in blood pressure, especially in the first and second trimesters. These changes are considered normal adaptations. However, a diastolic murmur is not typically considered a normal finding in pregnancy. While systolic murmurs can be common due to increased blood flow, diastolic murmurs warrant further investigation as they may indicate underlying cardiac pathology.",9
9229,"The patient initially presented with signs of hypovolemic shock due to blood loss from wrist lacerations. After resuscitation, his condition improved but then deteriorated with fever, flank pain, and a drop in GCS. The lab findings show low haptoglobin, elevated bilirubin, and signs of hemolysis (e.g., low haptoglobin, elevated bilirubin). These findings suggest hemolytic anemia, which is often due to a transfusion reaction. The rapid onset of symptoms after transfusion, including fever and flank pain, is consistent with an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction. This is typically due to major blood group incompatibility (e.g., ABO incompatibility), which causes intravascular hemolysis. The elevated bilirubin and low haptoglobin support this diagnosis. Minor blood group incompatibility usually causes a less severe reaction and is less likely to cause such acute symptoms.",9
9233,"The lesion on the sole of the foot described in the question is likely a plantar wart, which is commonly caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). Plantar warts are typically painful, especially when located on weight-bearing areas such as the sole of the foot. The progressive enlargement and pain are characteristic of warts. Trauma is less likely to cause a lesion that progressively enlarges over a month. Poxvirus typically causes molluscum contagiosum, which presents differently. A benign growth could be possible, but the description aligns more closely with a wart caused by HPV.",9
9244,"The patient presents with sudden, painless, bright red vaginal bleeding at 35 weeks' gestation. She has a history of a previous cesarean section, which increases the risk of placenta previa. The key features here are the painless nature of the bleeding and the absence of uterine contractions or abdominal tenderness, which are more consistent with placenta previa rather than abruptio placentae, which typically presents with painful bleeding and uterine tenderness. Uterine atony is unlikely as it is a postpartum condition. The latent phase of labor would not typically present with painless bleeding. The cessation of bleeding also aligns with placenta previa, where bleeding can stop spontaneously.",9
9254,"In HIV-positive patients, the risk of developing diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is influenced by several factors. The study mentioned likely highlights the impact of adherence to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) on the risk of developing DLBCL. Poor adherence to cART can lead to higher viral loads and lower CD4 counts, which increases the risk of opportunistic infections and certain cancers, including DLBCL. While a family history of cancer, male sex, and low income can be associated with various health risks, poor adherence to cART is directly linked to increased risk of DLBCL in HIV-positive patients due to its impact on immune function.",9
9248,"The patient's presentation includes a painless, hyperpigmented lesion with a greasy and wax-like appearance. These characteristics are classic for seborrheic keratosis, which is a benign skin condition. The fact that the lesions are itchy at times and have a waxy texture further supports this diagnosis. Lentigo maligna typically presents as a flat, pigmented lesion with irregular borders, basal cell carcinoma often appears as a pearly nodule, and dermatofibroma is usually a firm, raised nodule that is not greasy or wax-like. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is seborrheic keratosis.",9
9255,"The patient has undergone a total pancreatectomy and is now experiencing drainage of a dark green viscous fluid from her abdominal wound. This fluid is likely bile, suggesting a possible bile leak or fistula. Given the patient's recent surgery and the nature of the fluid, the most appropriate management would be to minimize stress on the gastrointestinal tract and manage the leak conservatively. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) would provide nutritional support while allowing the gastrointestinal tract to rest, and an ostomy pouch would manage the drainage externally. Surgical exploration is not immediately necessary as the patient is stable, and oral intake could exacerbate the leak. Wound debridement is not indicated as there is no sign of infection or necrosis.",9
9257,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of iron deficiency anemia, likely due to chronic blood loss from menorrhagia. The low hemoglobin, low MCV, low MCH, low reticulocyte count, and low serum ferritin all support this diagnosis. Iron deficiency anemia is known to be associated with restless leg syndrome (RLS), which is a specific feature of this condition. The other options are associated with different types of anemia or conditions: loss of proprioception is associated with vitamin B12 deficiency, bone deformities with thalassemia or sickle cell disease, and leg ulcers with sickle cell disease.",9
9252,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder (MDD), including depressed mood, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and psychomotor retardation. Additionally, he has a history of ADHD and is a heavy smoker who has struggled with quitting. Bupropion is an antidepressant that is also used to aid smoking cessation. It is particularly useful in this case because it can address both the depressive symptoms and the patient's desire to quit smoking. Bupropion is also less likely to cause weight gain compared to other antidepressants, which is beneficial given the patient's recent weight gain during a quit attempt. Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant with more side effects and is not first-line for MDD. Fluoxetine is an SSRI that could treat depression but does not aid smoking cessation. Valproic acid is used for bipolar disorder and seizure disorders, not for MDD.",9
9258,"The boy has acute lymphoblastic leukemia and recently started chemotherapy, which suggests the possibility of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). TLS is characterized by the rapid release of intracellular contents due to the destruction of tumor cells. This leads to metabolic abnormalities such as hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. The presence of urate crystals in the urine is also indicative of TLS due to the high levels of uric acid. Lactic acidosis can occur due to increased cellular turnover and metabolic activity. Therefore, the findings that would confirm TLS are hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, lactic acidosis, and urate crystals in the urine.",9
9262,"The patient experiences intense fear and physical symptoms specifically related to public speaking, which is a performance situation. His symptoms include palpitations, sweating, and difficulty breathing, which are typical of anxiety. These symptoms occur only in the context of public speaking and not in other social situations, indicating that his anxiety is limited to performance situations. He has a normal social life otherwise, which rules out generalized social anxiety disorder. Panic disorder is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks and persistent concern about having more attacks, which is not the case here. Normal human behavior would not typically involve such intense symptoms that interfere with functioning. Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis is social anxiety disorder, performance only.",9
9265,"The patient presents with signs consistent with cardiac tamponade, which is suggested by the triad of hypotension, jugular venous distention, and distant heart sounds (Beck's triad). The midline trachea and prominent jugular venous distention indicate that the issue is not due to a tension pneumothorax, which would typically cause tracheal deviation. The large ecchymosis over the sternum suggests a blunt chest trauma, which could lead to cardiac tamponade. In cardiac tamponade, fluid accumulation in the pericardial space impairs the filling of the heart chambers, particularly the right side, leading to decreased preload and subsequently decreased stroke volume. This results in hypotension due to impaired cardiac output. Therefore, the underlying physiology of the hypotension is impaired ventricular filling, specifically left ventricular filling, due to the external pressure from the fluid in the pericardial space.",9
9261,"The patient presents with signs and symptoms consistent with cellulitis, including redness, swelling, pain, fever, and purulent drainage. The poorly-demarcated borders and purulent drainage suggest a bacterial infection, likely caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus species. Given the purulent nature, MRSA is a concern, which is resistant to many antibiotics. Vancomycin is effective against MRSA and is appropriate for severe infections or when MRSA is suspected. Incision and drainage is typically reserved for abscesses, which are fluctuant, and this area is described as nonfluctuant. Prednisone is not indicated as it is an anti-inflammatory and could worsen the infection. Dicloxacillin is effective against MSSA but not MRSA. Therefore, the best next step is to start vancomycin therapy to cover for MRSA while awaiting culture results.",9
9268,"The patient's symptoms and travel history suggest an infection with Strongyloides stercoralis, a parasitic nematode. The presence of rhabditiform larvae in the stool is characteristic of Strongyloides infection. This parasite can cause a variety of symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. One of the complications of Strongyloides infection is the development of a perianal serpiginous rash, also known as ""larva currens,"" due to the migration of larvae through the skin. This is the most likely complication among the options provided.",9
9277,"The patient presents with a dry, hacking cough, which is a common side effect of ACE inhibitors like ramipril. This cough is due to the accumulation of bradykinin. The most appropriate management step is to switch from an ACE inhibitor to an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), which does not cause cough. Therefore, stopping ramipril and starting candesartan, an ARB, is the correct approach.",9
9263,"The patient has been started on atorvastatin, which is a statin medication used to lower cholesterol levels. Statins are known to have several potential adverse effects. While serious side effects like rhabdomyolysis (D) can occur, they are relatively rare. Flushing (B) is more commonly associated with niacin, another lipid-lowering agent. Lactic acidosis (C) is associated with metformin, a medication used for diabetes. The most common adverse effect of statins, including atorvastatin, is elevated liver enzymes (A), which can occur in a small percentage of patients and is why liver function tests are monitored during statin therapy.",9
9281,"The patient presents with severe chest pain following an episode of retching and bloody vomiting, which is suggestive of a rupture in the esophagus. The presence of crepitus over the left lower lobe of the lung indicates subcutaneous emphysema, which is a classic sign of esophageal rupture. This condition is known as Boerhaave syndrome, which occurs due to a sudden increase in intraesophageal pressure, often following forceful vomiting. The history of binge drinking and retching aligns with this diagnosis. The other options do not fit the clinical presentation as well as option C does. A linear laceration at the gastroesophageal junction (Mallory-Weiss tear) typically causes bleeding but not subcutaneous emphysema. A horizontal partition in the tunica media of the aorta (aortic dissection) would present differently, and Helicobacter pylori infection is related to peptic ulcers, not acute esophageal rupture.",9
9288,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of Turner syndrome, characterized by primary amenorrhea, short stature, and specific physical features such as widely spaced nipples, cubitus valgus, and short 4th and 5th metacarpals. The recurrent otitis media and high arched palate also fit this diagnosis. Turner syndrome is associated with an increased number of benign nevi on the skin. Other options like acanthosis nigricans, cutaneous angiomas, and xerosis are not typically associated with Turner syndrome.",9
9290,"The clinical presentation of this 7-year-old girl is suggestive of Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), which is a type of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The key features include the non-blanching, palpable purpuric rash on the legs, abdominal pain, arthralgia (swollen and painful ankle), and renal involvement (suggested by positive stool occult blood indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding). The normal platelet count and elevated ESR support an inflammatory process rather than a thrombocytopenic purpura. The recent history of a sore throat treated with antibiotics is also consistent with a preceding upper respiratory infection, which is a common trigger for HSP. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is leukocytoclastic vasculitis, specifically Henoch-Schönlein purpura.",9
9295,"The clinical presentation of the 3-month-old boy, including lethargy, short stature, increased weight, coarse facial features, large protruding tongue, and umbilical hernia, is suggestive of congenital hypothyroidism. This condition is often due to iodine deficiency, especially in areas where iodine is not adequately available in the diet. The symptoms align with those of congenital hypothyroidism, which can lead to cretinism if untreated, characterized by developmental delays and intellectual disability. The fact that the child was born at home with no prenatal care further supports the possibility of iodine deficiency as a cause, as prenatal care often includes iodine supplementation. Therefore, the most likely association with the cause of this patient's disorder is iodine deficiency.",9
9296,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of both upper and lower motor neuron involvement. The progressive weakness, muscle atrophy, and fasciculations (spontaneous twitching) indicate lower motor neuron (LMN) involvement. The increased deep tendon reflexes and rigidity in the lower limbs suggest upper motor neuron (UMN) involvement. This combination of UMN and LMN signs is characteristic of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In ALS, the lower motor neuron signs are due to degeneration of the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord, which corresponds to the ventral horn. Therefore, the likely site of the lesion is the ventral horn.",9
9300,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of cervicitis, including an inflamed and friable cervix with mucopurulent discharge. The absence of fever, chills, or abdominal pain, along with a normal vaginal pH of 3.5, makes bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis less likely. The most common causes of cervicitis are Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) is the most sensitive and specific test for detecting these infections. Therefore, the most appropriate initial step in management is to perform a NAAT to identify the causative organism.",9
9303,"The patient presents with recurrent infections by catalase-positive organisms like Staphylococcus aureus, which suggests a defect in the ability to kill these bacteria. The nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test remaining clear indicates a failure to produce reactive oxygen species, which are necessary for the respiratory burst in phagocytes. This is characteristic of Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD), where there is a defect in NADPH oxidase, leading to an inability to generate the microbicidal respiratory burst. Therefore, the key pathophysiologic event is the inability to generate the microbicidal respiratory burst.",9
9304,"The clinical presentation of recurrent infections, easy bruising, and the presence of giant cytoplasmic granules in granulocytes and platelets is suggestive of Chediak-Higashi syndrome. This condition is characterized by partial oculocutaneous albinism, recurrent pyogenic infections, and neurological problems. The laboratory findings of pancytopenia (low hemoglobin, leukocyte, and platelet counts) and the presence of giant granules in leukocytes are classic for this syndrome. Chediak-Higashi syndrome is caused by a defect in the lysosomal trafficking regulator gene, which leads to impaired lysosomal fusion and function, resulting in the observed symptoms.",9
9305,"The patient presents with joint pain, morning stiffness, Raynaud's phenomenon (fingers changing color in cold), skin tightening on the face, and fatigue. The laboratory findings show a positive ANA and positive Anti Scl-70 antibody, which is highly suggestive of systemic sclerosis. The presence of skin thickening on the face and hands, along with the positive Anti Scl-70 antibody, points towards diffuse cutaneous systemic scleroderma rather than limited cutaneous systemic scleroderma. Limited cutaneous systemic scleroderma is more associated with anti-centromere antibodies, which are negative in this patient. The negative anti-histone and anti-DsDNA antibodies make drug-induced lupus and SLE less likely. The absence of muscle weakness and negative anti-Jo-1 antibody make polymyositis unlikely.",9
9319,"The patient presents with acute onset of right-sided weakness and slurred speech, which are classic signs of a stroke. The history of increased anxiety, fatigue, lightheadedness, and shortness of breath with exertion, along with a variable intensity S1, suggests the possibility of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation can lead to the formation of thrombi in the left atrium, which can embolize to the brain and cause an ischemic stroke. The irregularly irregular pulse and the absence of P waves on ECG are characteristic of atrial fibrillation. Therefore, further evaluation is most likely to show an irregularly irregular rhythm without P waves on ECG, indicating atrial fibrillation as the underlying cause of the embolic stroke.",9
9312,"The patient has a history of schizophrenia and was on fluphenazine, a typical antipsychotic, for 2 years before being switched to risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic, two weeks ago. She presents with repetitive tongue twisting, abnormal movements of the hands and legs, protrusion of the tongue, smacking of the lips, twisting movements of the arms, and frequent foot tapping. These symptoms are characteristic of tardive dyskinesia, a condition associated with long-term use of antipsychotics, particularly typical ones like fluphenazine. Tardive dyskinesia involves involuntary, repetitive movements, often of the face and extremities. The timing and nature of the symptoms align with this diagnosis. Cerebellar stroke would present with ataxia and coordination issues, not the described movements. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome involves severe muscle rigidity, fever, and autonomic instability, not the described dyskinetic movements. Akathisia involves a feeling of inner restlessness and an urge to move, but not the specific involuntary movements described here.",9
9320,"The patient's symptoms are suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), characterized by intermittent pain and stiffness in the hands and feet, morning stiffness lasting about an hour, and swelling and tenderness of the wrists and proximal interphalangeal joints. The presence of fever and myalgia during episodes also supports an inflammatory process. Her sister's history of systemic lupus erythematosus suggests a possible familial predisposition to autoimmune diseases. 

The treatment of RA often involves disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to slow disease progression and prevent joint damage. Methotrexate is the first-line DMARD for RA. While NSAIDs like diclofenac provide symptomatic relief, they do not alter disease progression. Adalimumab, a TNF inhibitor, is typically used after an inadequate response to methotrexate. Prednisolone can be used for acute flare management but is not a long-term solution due to side effects.

Given the chronic nature of her symptoms and the need to prevent joint damage, methotrexate is the most appropriate choice to manage her condition long-term.",9
9321,"The patient presents with symptoms and history suggestive of lung cancer, likely a non-small cell lung cancer given the smoking history and weight loss. The presence of a mass in the lung and hemoptysis further supports this. In cancer cachexia, which is common in advanced cancer, there is increased muscle protein degradation and autophagy. Autophagic vacuoles are involved in the degradation of cellular components, and their increase is associated with muscle wasting seen in cachexia. Therefore, in the context of cancer cachexia, the intracellular component most likely increased in the muscle cells is autophagic vacuoles.",9
9279,,0
9326,"The infant presents with symptoms of intestinal obstruction, specifically bilious vomiting and failure to pass stool, which are indicative of duodenal atresia. The physical features described, such as a flat facial profile, small eyes, prominent epicanthal folds, and a single transverse palmar crease, are characteristic of Down syndrome (Trisomy 21). Duodenal atresia is commonly associated with Down syndrome. Therefore, the combination of the clinical and physical features suggests that the infant has Down syndrome, which is a result of trisomy 21.",9
9333,"The clinical presentation described in the question is suggestive of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. This condition is characterized by self-mutilating behaviors, such as biting, along with neurological and behavioral abnormalities, including aggressive behavior and intellectual disability. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), which leads to an overproduction of uric acid, causing symptoms like severe joint pain (gout) and neurological issues. The inheritance pattern of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is X-linked recessive, as the HPRT1 gene is located on the X chromosome. Males are typically affected, while females are usually carriers.",9
9334,"The patient presents with confusion, lethargy, and a seizure, which are symptoms consistent with hyponatremia. The laboratory results confirm hyponatremia with a serum sodium level of 125 mEq/L. The patient's recent history of diarrhea could have contributed to this electrolyte imbalance. In cases of symptomatic hyponatremia, especially when seizures are present, it is crucial to increase the serum sodium level to prevent further neurological complications. The most appropriate treatment for acute symptomatic hyponatremia is the administration of hypertonic saline (3% saline) to rapidly increase the serum sodium level. This is done cautiously to avoid overly rapid correction, which can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome. Therefore, the correct treatment is to increase the serum sodium slowly with hypertonic saline solution.",9
9328,"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), likely due to long-standing hypertension. The symptoms of nocturia, fatigue, shortness of breath on exertion, orthopnea (using two pillows), and physical findings such as a laterally displaced apical impulse, pitting edema, S4 gallop, and bibasilar rales indicate fluid overload and diastolic dysfunction. In heart failure, there is activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) due to decreased renal perfusion. This leads to constriction of the efferent renal arterioles to maintain glomerular filtration rate (GFR) despite reduced cardiac output. Therefore, the pathophysiologic change most likely to be observed is constriction of the efferent renal arterioles.",9
9335,"The patient has a fracture and decreased bone mineral density, suggesting osteoporosis. Postmenopausal osteoporosis is often treated with bisphosphonates, which are analogs of pyrophosphate. Bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption by osteoclasts, helping to increase bone density and reduce fracture risk. Pyrophosphate is a natural inhibitor of mineralization, and bisphosphonates mimic its structure to inhibit osteoclast activity.",9
9340,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a metabolic myopathy. The key features include muscle weakness, cramps, and myoglobinuria (indicated by reddish-brown urine and positive blood on urinalysis without RBCs). These symptoms are consistent with a glycogen storage disease affecting muscle metabolism.

The elevated creatine kinase (CK) level indicates muscle damage. The improvement of symptoms after rest and the occurrence of myoglobinuria after exercise are characteristic of McArdle disease, which is caused by myophosphorylase deficiency. This condition leads to an inability to break down glycogen in muscle cells, resulting in exercise intolerance and muscle pain.

The other options are less consistent with the presentation:
- CTG repeat in the DMPK gene is associated with myotonic dystrophy, which presents differently.
- Acid maltase deficiency (Pompe disease) typically presents with more severe symptoms and earlier in life.
- Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency affects fatty acid metabolism and presents with hypoketotic hypoglycemia, not exercise-induced muscle symptoms.

Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is myophosphorylase deficiency.",9
9336,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of infective endocarditis, such as fever, night sweats, malaise, and a new heart murmur. The holosystolic murmur radiating to the left axilla is indicative of mitral regurgitation. The skin lesions on the palms could be Janeway lesions, which are associated with infective endocarditis. Among the options, mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a known predisposing factor for infective endocarditis due to the turbulent blood flow it causes, which can lead to endothelial damage and subsequent bacterial colonization. Rheumatic heart disease can also predispose to endocarditis, but the murmur and presentation are more consistent with MVP. Systemic lupus erythematosus and pulmonary stenosis are less commonly associated with endocarditis in this context.",9
9344,"The infant presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of a disorder in the phenylalanine metabolism pathway. The key findings include high levels of phenylalanine and prolactin, low levels of homovanillic acid and serotonin, and the presence of fair skin, red hair, and blue eyes. These symptoms are consistent with a deficiency in the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, which is catalyzed by phenylalanine hydroxylase. However, the presence of low homovanillic acid and serotonin suggests a problem with the synthesis of neurotransmitters, which requires tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) as a cofactor. Dihydropteridine reductase is responsible for regenerating BH4 from its oxidized form. A deficiency in dihydropteridine reductase would lead to decreased BH4, affecting both phenylalanine hydroxylase and the synthesis of neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin, explaining the low levels of homovanillic acid and serotonin. Therefore, the enzyme deficient in this patient is dihydropteridine reductase.",9
9339,"The clinical presentation of recurrent skin lesions, respiratory tract infections, and lymphadenopathy in a young child suggests an immunodeficiency disorder. The presence of purulent skin lesions and recurrent infections points towards a defect in the innate immune system, particularly involving neutrophils. 

Option A, defective neutrophil chemotaxis, is associated with conditions like Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency, which typically presents with delayed umbilical cord separation and lack of pus formation, which doesn't match this case.

Option B, NADPH oxidase deficiency, is characteristic of Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD). CGD leads to recurrent bacterial and fungal infections due to the inability of neutrophils to produce reactive oxygen species, resulting in granuloma formation. The recurrent purulent skin lesions and lymphadenopathy are consistent with CGD.

Option C, impaired repair of double-strand DNA breaks, is related to conditions like Ataxia-Telangiectasia, which presents with ataxia, telangiectasia, and immunodeficiency, but not typically with purulent skin lesions.

Option D, impaired signaling to actin cytoskeleton reorganization, is associated with Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome, which presents with eczema, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent infections, but the skin lesions are usually not purulent.

Given the symptoms of recurrent purulent infections and lymphadenopathy, the most likely underlying mechanism is NADPH oxidase deficiency.",9
9346,"The patient presents with signs suggestive of chronic liver disease, likely due to alcohol use, as indicated by the reddish palms (palmar erythema), abdominal distention (possibly ascites), and elevated liver enzymes with a higher AST than ALT, which is typical in alcoholic liver disease. The thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) is likely due to hypersplenism, a common consequence of portal hypertension secondary to liver cirrhosis. In portal hypertension, the spleen becomes enlarged and sequesters more platelets, leading to thrombocytopenia. Other options like bone marrow infiltration, uremia, and autoimmune antibodies are less consistent with the clinical picture and laboratory findings.",9
9347,"The patient is showing signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), characterized by hypoxemia, bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, and a history of a precipitating factor (wet gangrene). The current ventilator settings show a high FiO2 with low PaO2, indicating severe hypoxemia. Increasing PEEP can help improve oxygenation by preventing alveolar collapse and improving ventilation-perfusion matching. Prone positioning is also used in ARDS to improve oxygenation, but increasing PEEP is a more immediate intervention to improve oxygenation. Increasing tidal volume is not recommended due to the risk of barotrauma. Transfusion of red blood cells is not the primary intervention for improving oxygenation in ARDS.",9
9345,"The patient presents with painless vaginal bleeding at 32 weeks gestation, which is suggestive of placenta previa, especially given her history of previous cesarean sections. Placenta previa is characterized by the placenta covering the cervical os, leading to bleeding without pain or contractions. A transvaginal ultrasound is the most accurate and safest method to confirm the diagnosis of placenta previa, as it provides a clear view of the placental location relative to the cervical os. A digital cervical examination is contraindicated in cases of suspected placenta previa due to the risk of provoking further bleeding. Coagulation studies are not relevant to diagnosing placenta previa. While a transabdominal ultrasound can be used, it is less accurate than a transvaginal ultrasound for this purpose.",9
9352,"The patient has a history of recurrent miscarriages, a blood clot during her first pregnancy, and symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and joint discomfort. These symptoms, along with the history of thrombosis and miscarriages, suggest a possible autoimmune condition. The prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) could indicate the presence of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), which is associated with recurrent miscarriages and thrombosis. APS is often associated with positive VDRL tests due to the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, which can cause false-positive results for syphilis. Therefore, the positive VDRL is most likely associated with her infertility due to APS.",9
9356,"Cat bites are known to have a high risk of infection due to the presence of bacteria such as Pasteurella multocida. The appropriate management of a cat bite involves antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infection. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is the antibiotic of choice for prophylaxis against infections from cat bites due to its effectiveness against the common organisms involved. Surgical debridement and laceration closure are not typically recommended immediately for puncture wounds from animal bites due to the risk of trapping bacteria inside, which can lead to infection. Therefore, the best management in this case is to prescribe amoxicillin-clavulanate without immediate closure of the wound.",9
9358,"The patient presents with fatigue, macrocytic anemia, and a peripheral blood smear showing hypersegmented neutrophils, which are indicative of megaloblastic anemia. The endoscopy reveals thin and smooth gastric mucosa without rugae, suggesting atrophic gastritis. This is consistent with pernicious anemia, which is caused by autoimmune destruction of gastric parietal cells leading to vitamin B12 deficiency. Her history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune condition, further supports the likelihood of another autoimmune disorder like pernicious anemia. Lead poisoning typically causes microcytic anemia, not macrocytic. Chronic alcoholism can cause macrocytic anemia due to folate deficiency, but there is no indication of significant alcohol use. Helicobacter pylori gastritis does not typically cause macrocytic anemia or the described gastric changes.",9
9362,"The patient presents with persistent vomiting, which is non-bloody and non-bilious, suggesting a gastric outlet obstruction or another cause of gastric retention. Vomiting leads to the loss of gastric acid (hydrochloric acid), which results in a loss of hydrogen ions. This loss of hydrogen ions causes a metabolic alkalosis. Additionally, vomiting can lead to a loss of potassium, as potassium is lost in gastric secretions and through renal compensation mechanisms. Therefore, the most likely laboratory changes in this patient would be metabolic alkalosis due to the loss of hydrogen ions and hypokalemia due to the loss of potassium.",9
9359,"The clinical presentation of the patient suggests a diagnosis of achondroplasia. The key features include short stature with disproportionate shortening of the proximal segments (rhizomelic shortening), macrocephaly with frontal bossing, and lumbar lordosis. These are characteristic of achondroplasia, which is caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene. The FGFR3 receptor is involved in bone growth regulation, and mutations lead to the abnormal development seen in achondroplasia.",9
9363,"The patient's symptoms and the blood pressure reading of 140/40 mm Hg suggest a wide pulse pressure, which is characteristic of aortic regurgitation. The murmur along the left sternal border is likely a diastolic murmur, which is also consistent with aortic regurgitation. In aortic regurgitation, blood flows back into the left ventricle during diastole, leading to volume overload. This results in an increased left ventricular end-diastolic volume as the ventricle accommodates the extra volume of blood. Over time, this can lead to left ventricular dilation and hypertrophy to compensate for the increased volume load.",9
9365,"The patient has symptoms of a prosthetic joint infection, and the blood cultures show gram-positive, catalase-positive cocci that grow on mannitol salt agar without color change. This suggests the organism is likely Staphylococcus epidermidis, which is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus. Staphylococcus epidermidis is known for its ability to form biofilms on prosthetic devices, which is a key factor in its virulence. Biofilm formation is facilitated by the production of exopolysaccharides, which protect the bacteria from the host immune response and antibiotics.",9
9370,"The scenario describes a patient with a persistent belief that his wife is cheating on him, despite evidence to the contrary. This belief is non-bizarre, as it could potentially happen in real life, but there is no evidence to support it. The patient is still able to function normally in his job and family life, which suggests that his daily functioning is not impaired. This aligns with the diagnostic criteria for delusional disorder, where delusions are non-bizarre and functioning is not markedly impaired. Schizophrenia, on the other hand, requires symptoms from core domains and impairment in functioning, which does not fit this case. Therefore, the correct diagnostic criterion for delusional disorder is that the delusions must be non-bizarre.",9
9369,"The committee is focusing on preventing wrong site surgery by analyzing systemic, design, process, and service issues. This approach aligns with a proactive method known as Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), which is used to identify potential failures in a process before they occur. FMEA involves identifying failure modes, which are the ways in which a process might fail. This is different from Root Cause Analysis (RCA), which is typically used after an incident has occurred to determine the underlying causes. Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles are used for continuous improvement, and simplification refers to reducing complexity in processes. Therefore, the component that fits the committee's proactive analysis is 'Failure modes.'",9
9374,"Selection bias occurs when the participants included in a study are not representative of the general population, potentially affecting the study's validity. In this scenario, the 49-year-old man with a family history of colorectal cancer is more motivated to participate due to his personal concerns, which may not be representative of the general population under 50. This can lead to selection bias, as the study sample may over-represent individuals with a higher perceived risk of colorectal cancer, thus skewing the results.",9
9372,"The patient presents with watery diarrhea, dehydration, and hypotension, which are indicative of a significant fluid loss. The diarrhea is described as copious and watery, which suggests a large volume of fluid being lost. Secretory diarrhea is characterized by large volumes of watery stool and is often caused by toxins that stimulate intestinal secretion or inhibit absorption, such as those from Vibrio cholerae or enterotoxigenic E. coli. Invasive diarrhea typically presents with bloody stools and fever due to mucosal invasion by pathogens like Shigella or Salmonella. Osmotic diarrhea results from the presence of non-absorbable substances in the intestine, leading to water retention, and usually resolves with fasting. Steatorrhea involves fatty stools due to malabsorption. Given the presentation and the context of recent travel to Thailand, secretory diarrhea is the most likely categorization.",9
9376,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, which is characterized by the presence of hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract and mucocutaneous pigmentation (blue-gray macules on the lips and palms). The family history of gastric cancer and the presence of multiple polyps throughout the small bowel and colon further support this diagnosis. In Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, the polyps are typically hamartomatous, which are benign growths that can occur in this condition.",9
9382,"The patient's age, history of sun exposure (retired winemaker), and the description of the skin changes on the scalp are key factors in determining the diagnosis. The rough patches that reappear after being scraped off suggest a condition related to sun damage. Actinic keratosis is a common precancerous skin lesion that presents as rough, scaly patches on sun-exposed areas, particularly in older individuals. The history of a mole removal is not directly relevant to the current scalp lesions. Keratoacanthoma typically presents as a rapidly growing nodule, Bowen disease is a form of squamous cell carcinoma in situ, and amelanotic melanoma is a type of melanoma that lacks pigment, which doesn't fit the description of rough patches. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is actinic keratosis.",9
9385,"The clinical presentation of the patient suggests acute hepatitis, likely due to an infectious cause. The key points include the recent upper respiratory infection, jaundice, dark urine, and tender hepatomegaly. The elevated direct bilirubin and alanine aminotransferase levels indicate hepatocellular injury with cholestasis. The history of eating at a roadside restaurant suggests a possible exposure to hepatitis A virus (HAV), which is transmitted via the fecal-oral route and is common in such settings. The presence of fever, fatigue, nausea, and jaundice aligns with acute viral hepatitis. To confirm hepatitis A infection, the most appropriate test is the detection of serum anti-HAV IgM antibodies, which are indicative of a recent HAV infection.",9
9386,"The clinical presentation and CSF findings are indicative of bacterial meningitis, specifically caused by Neisseria meningitidis, given the presence of gram-negative diplococci. Neisseria meningitidis can lead to meningococcal meningitis, which is associated with several complications. One of the well-known complications of meningococcal infection is Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, which is characterized by adrenal hemorrhage leading to adrenal insufficiency. This occurs due to the severe sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) that can accompany meningococcal infections. The other options, such as temporal lobe inflammation, acute pancreatitis, and deep neck abscess, are not typical complications of Neisseria meningitidis infection.",9
9392,"The patient presents with symptoms and findings suggestive of an infectious process, particularly given his HIV status and risk factors. The key findings include a lymphocyte-predominant pleural effusion with high protein and high adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels. These findings are characteristic of tuberculosis (TB), especially in the context of HIV infection. The presence of hilar lymphadenopathy and the patient's social history (homelessness, history of intravenous drug use, and inconsistent antiretroviral therapy) further support the likelihood of TB. Rheumatoid arthritis typically causes a neutrophil-predominant effusion, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia does not usually cause pleural effusion, and lung cancer is less likely given the lymphocyte predominance and high ADA.",9
9391,"The patient is on antiretroviral therapy and has developed reduced susceptibility to darunavir and ritonavir, which are protease inhibitors. Protease inhibitors work by inhibiting the HIV protease enzyme, which is responsible for cleaving newly synthesized polyproteins into functional viral proteins. This process is crucial for the maturation of the virus. Mutations that confer resistance to protease inhibitors typically affect the enzyme's ability to cleave these polyproteins, which is a post-translational modification process. Therefore, the molecular process affected by the mutation is the modification of translated proteins.",10
9390,"The patient presents with hypoglycemia, elevated insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin levels, and low ß-hydroxybutyrate levels. These findings suggest endogenous hyperinsulinism. Elevated C-peptide and proinsulin levels rule out exogenous insulin administration, as exogenous insulin would suppress C-peptide production. Sulfonylurea use could cause similar lab findings, but there is no indication of sulfonylurea use in the history. Noninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome (NIPHS) is rare and typically presents with postprandial hypoglycemia, not fasting hypoglycemia. Primary adrenal insufficiency would not cause elevated insulin levels. The combination of symptoms, including hypoglycemia, headaches, and galactorrhea, suggests a possible insulinoma, which is a pancreatic tumor that secretes insulin, causing hypoglycemia.",9
9398,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a pulmonary embolism (PE). She has risk factors such as smoking, use of oral contraceptives, and recent physical exertion. The sudden onset of chest pain, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, and calf pain (suggestive of deep vein thrombosis) further support this diagnosis. The decreased breath sounds and hypoxemia are consistent with a PE. A wedge-shaped filling defect on chest CT, known as a Hampton's hump, is a classic finding in PE due to pulmonary infarction.",9
9402,"The patient presents with sudden onset of vaginal bleeding at 39 weeks' gestation, a history of a previous cesarean section, and no prenatal care. The fetal heart rate is low at 96/min, indicating fetal distress. The bleeding is severe, and the membranes are ruptured. Placenta previa typically presents with painless bleeding, but the fetal heart rate is often normal unless there is significant blood loss. Placenta accreta involves abnormal placental attachment and usually presents with complications during delivery rather than sudden bleeding. Bloody show is associated with labor and is not typically severe bleeding. Ruptured vasa previa involves fetal vessels crossing the cervical os, leading to fetal blood loss and distress when membranes rupture, which matches the severe bleeding and fetal bradycardia observed here.",9
9400,"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of mitral stenosis. The loud first heart sound and low-pitched rumbling diastolic murmur at the apex are characteristic of this condition. Mitral stenosis often results from rheumatic heart disease and can lead to increased left atrial pressure, pulmonary congestion, and eventually pulmonary hypertension. One of the common complications of mitral stenosis is atrial fibrillation, a type of cardiac arrhythmia, due to the enlargement of the left atrium. This makes cardiac arrhythmia the most likely complication in this scenario.",9
9405,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of acute decompensated heart failure, likely precipitated by the recent illness and possibly the use of an over-the-counter cold preparation, which may contain decongestants that can exacerbate heart failure. The presence of pulmonary crackles, a third heart sound, and peripheral edema indicates fluid overload. The initial management should focus on relieving the congestion and reducing the preload. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is effective in rapidly reducing fluid overload by promoting diuresis, thereby relieving symptoms of pulmonary congestion and peripheral edema. Other options like dobutamine and digoxin are not appropriate for initial management in this scenario as they are used for different indications. Nitroglycerin can be used to reduce preload but is not the primary choice in this context where diuresis is needed.",9
9404,"Osteopenia is characterized by a decrease in bone mineral density, which can progress to osteoporosis. The T-score of -1.5 indicates osteopenia. Among the options provided, smoking is a well-known risk factor for decreased bone density. Smoking affects bone health by reducing blood supply to the bones, decreasing calcium absorption, and affecting the balance of hormones that regulate bone remodeling. Hypoparathyroidism is not associated with osteopenia; it typically leads to increased bone density. NSAID use and obesity are not directly linked to osteopenia. In fact, obesity is often associated with higher bone density due to increased mechanical loading on bones. Therefore, smoking is the strongest predisposing factor for osteopenia among the options given.",9
9408,"The formation of granulomas in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is primarily mediated by the immune response involving TH1 cells and macrophages. TH1 cells release cytokines such as IFN-gamma, which activate macrophages. Activated macrophages then engulf the bacteria and form a granuloma to contain the infection. This process is crucial in preventing the spread of tuberculosis. TH2 cells are more involved in humoral immunity and allergic responses, while neutrophils and NK cells play different roles in the immune system. Therefore, the correct pair of cells involved in the formation of granulomas in tuberculosis is TH1 cells and macrophages.",9
9407,"The clinical presentation of the 14-year-old boy suggests gigantism, characterized by excessive growth due to increased levels of growth hormone (GH) before the closure of the epiphyseal growth plates. The symptoms include tall stature, broad hands and feet, frontal bossing, and protrusion of the mandible. The elevated fasting serum glucose level is consistent with insulin resistance, which can occur with excess GH. The bone age is advanced, indicating accelerated growth. In gigantism, the pathogenesis involves increased secretion of GH, which stimulates the liver to produce increased levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Therefore, the most likely mechanism involved in this condition is increased serum IGF-1 due to excessive GH secretion.",9
9412,"The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain that began 2 hours after eating at a picnic suggest a foodborne illness. The rapid onset of symptoms is characteristic of food poisoning caused by preformed toxins. Among the options, a toxin produced by a gram-positive, catalase-positive bacteria, specifically Staphylococcus aureus, is known for causing rapid-onset food poisoning. Staphylococcus aureus produces enterotoxins that can cause symptoms within 1-6 hours after ingestion. The other options do not fit the clinical picture as well: antigliadin antibody is related to celiac disease, gram-negative bacillus could suggest other types of infections but not with such rapid onset, and gram-positive, catalase-negative bacteria (such as Streptococcus) are not typically associated with this type of food poisoning.",9
9414,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are indicative of hypothyroidism, specifically primary hypothyroidism due to elevated TSH and decreased T4 levels. The presence of specific antibodies suggests an autoimmune process, most likely Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the thyroid gland is typically infiltrated by lymphocytes, and there is often the formation of germinal centers. This is consistent with the autoimmune destruction of the thyroid gland. The other options describe histological findings associated with different thyroid conditions: Option A describes anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, Option B describes papillary thyroid carcinoma, and Option D describes Graves' disease. Therefore, the biopsy would most likely show lymphocytic infiltrate with germinal center formation, characteristic of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.",10
9409,"The patient's pleural effusion is characterized by clear, yellow-colored fluid with a low protein concentration of 1.9 g/dL. This suggests a transudative effusion, which is typically caused by systemic factors that alter the balance of hydrostatic and oncotic pressures. Common causes of transudative effusions include congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome. In this case, the low protein concentration is indicative of a transudate rather than an exudate. Exudative effusions, which have higher protein content, are usually due to local factors such as infection, malignancy, or inflammation, as seen in conditions like tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, or bacterial pneumonia. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's pleural effusion, given the transudative nature, is congestive heart failure.",9
9415,"The patient is an 18-year-old woman who has not experienced menarche, which can be a sign of an underlying condition. She presents with a low body weight (85 pounds at 62 inches tall), which is significantly underweight. She has fine hair covering her arms, which can be lanugo, a sign of malnutrition. Her behavior includes a lack of appetite, difficulty sleeping, feelings of guilt, and excessive exercise. She also admits to binge-eating and vomiting, which indicates a pattern of disordered eating. These symptoms align with anorexia nervosa, particularly the binge-eating/purging type. While she admits to occasional cocaine use, the primary issue seems to be related to her eating behaviors and body image, which are central to anorexia nervosa. Her symptoms do not fully align with binge-eating disorder, as she engages in compensatory behaviors (vomiting and excessive exercise). Although she shows some depressive symptoms, they are likely secondary to her eating disorder. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is anorexia nervosa.",9
9424,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of poliomyelitis, which is caused by the poliovirus. The key features include acute flaccid paralysis, especially in the lower limbs, following a prodrome of fever, fatigue, and headache. The absence of reflexes and decreased muscle tone with intact sensation are characteristic of lower motor neuron lesions, which are typical in poliovirus infections. Poliovirus is a non-enveloped virus with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is a non-enveloped (+) ssRNA virus.",9
9422,"The clinical presentation and imaging findings suggest chronic pyelonephritis, likely due to vesicoureteral reflux, given the recurrent nature of the urinary tract infections and renal scarring. In chronic pyelonephritis, especially with reflux nephropathy, the renal biopsy would typically show tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis. The presence of eosinophilic casts in the tubules is characteristic of chronic pyelonephritis. These casts are often referred to as ""thyroidization"" of the kidney, where the tubules resemble thyroid follicles due to the presence of these eosinophilic casts. This is due to the chronic inflammation and damage to the tubules over time.",9
9416,"The infant presents with jaundice due to elevated unconjugated bilirubin, which is not improving with phototherapy. The family history of a maternal aunt who died as an infant suggests a possible genetic condition. Crigler–Najjar syndrome type I is characterized by severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to a complete deficiency of the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, leading to persistent jaundice that does not respond to phototherapy. Crigler–Najjar syndrome type II is less severe and usually responds to phototherapy. Hemolytic anemia would typically show signs of hemolysis such as anemia or reticulocytosis, which are not present here. Gilbert syndrome is a mild condition that usually does not present with significant jaundice in the neonatal period. Given the severity and persistence of the jaundice, along with the family history, Crigler–Najjar syndrome type I is the most likely diagnosis.",9
9426,"The patient's symptoms and findings suggest a connective tissue disease, likely systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), given the history of miscarriages, joint symptoms, oral ulcerations, and skin findings. The pulmonary symptoms and fine inspiratory crackles suggest interstitial lung disease, which is associated with decreased diffusing capacity due to impaired gas exchange across the alveolar-capillary membrane. Increased airway resistance and increased lung compliance are more associated with obstructive lung diseases, while decreased right atrial pressure is not typically related to this presentation.",9
9433,"The patient is experiencing a tonic-clonic seizure postpartum, with a history of gestational hypertension and symptoms such as headache, blurry vision, and abdominal pain. These symptoms, along with the elevated blood pressure and hyperreflexia, suggest eclampsia. Eclampsia is characterized by seizures in the setting of preeclampsia, which includes hypertension and end-organ dysfunction. The most appropriate management for eclampsia is the administration of magnesium sulfate, which is used to prevent further seizures. Other options like valproic acid and phenytoin are not first-line treatments for eclampsia, and hydralazine is used for blood pressure control but does not address the seizures directly.",9
9428,"The patient presents with somnolence and a metabolic acidosis, as indicated by a low bicarbonate level (HCO3-: 16 mEq/L) and elevated anion gap (Na+ - (Cl- + HCO3-) = 144 - (98 + 16) = 30). The elevated creatinine (2.7 mg/dL) and BUN (44 mg/dL) suggest acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease, which could contribute to the acidosis. The glucose level is elevated at 202 mg/dL, but not high enough to suggest diabetic ketoacidosis. The patient's medications include naproxen and ibuprofen, which are NSAIDs that can cause renal impairment and contribute to metabolic acidosis. Given the elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis and renal impairment, the best next step is to discontinue the patient's home medications, particularly the NSAIDs, which are likely contributing to the renal dysfunction and acidosis.",9
9436,"The patient presents with retrosternal chest tightness, shortness of breath, wheezing, and facial flushing shortly after surgery. He has a history of asthma and sensitivity to aspirin, which suggests a possible aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). This condition is characterized by a pseudoallergic reaction due to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) by NSAIDs like ketorolac, leading to increased leukotriene production and bronchospasm. The use of ketorolac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, could have triggered this reaction. The patient's symptoms and history align with a pseudoallergic reaction rather than the other options.",9
9439,"The patient's symptoms and findings suggest fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), which is a condition that can cause renal artery stenosis. The presence of a bruit in the neck and abdomen, along with hypertension, supports this diagnosis. FMD often affects young women and can lead to secondary hypertension due to renal artery stenosis, which would result in elevated renin levels as the kidneys perceive low perfusion pressure and activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The 'swoosh' sound in the ear could be due to carotid involvement. Therefore, further evaluation is most likely to show elevated renin levels due to renal artery stenosis.",9
9438,"The patient presents with severe abdominal pain, bilious vomiting, and a history of episodic right upper quadrant pain after fatty meals, suggesting gallbladder involvement. The fever, leukocytosis, and electrolyte imbalances indicate an acute process. The CT scan (not shown here) likely reveals findings consistent with gallstone ileus, a complication of cholelithiasis where a gallstone causes bowel obstruction. This is supported by the history of gallbladder-related symptoms and the acute presentation of bowel obstruction. Cholelithiasis is the underlying cause as it leads to gallstone ileus.",9
9450,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of acute diverticulitis, including lower abdominal pain, fever, leukocytosis, and a tender mass on rectal examination. The most appropriate imaging modality to confirm the diagnosis of diverticulitis is a CT scan of the abdomen with contrast. This imaging technique can identify inflammation, abscess formation, and other complications associated with diverticulitis. Ultrasound is not typically used for diagnosing diverticulitis, and flexible sigmoidoscopy is contraindicated in acute diverticulitis due to the risk of perforation. An abdominal x-ray is not sensitive enough to confirm diverticulitis, though it may be used to rule out perforation or obstruction.",9
9446,"The patient presents with fever, chills, abdominal pain, and jaundice, which are classic signs of Charcot's triad, indicative of ascending cholangitis. The ultrasound findings of a dilated bile duct and a calculus (stone) in the bile duct further support this diagnosis. Ascending cholangitis is an infection of the bile duct, often due to obstruction by a gallstone, leading to bacterial infection. The patient's icterus (jaundice) and right upper quadrant tenderness align with this condition. Liver abscess, cholecystitis, and appendicitis do not typically present with this combination of symptoms and ultrasound findings.",9
9455,"The patient's symptoms include pain and stiffness in the hands and wrists, a nonpruritic rash, and a history of fever and runny nose. The stiffness is worse in the morning but improves after 15-20 minutes, which is characteristic of inflammatory arthritis. The rash is described as lacy and macular, which is consistent with the rash seen in parvovirus B19 infection. Her occupation as an elementary school teacher increases her exposure to parvovirus, which is common in children. The laboratory studies show no abnormalities, which makes autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis less likely. Disseminated gonococcal disease typically presents with a different type of rash and joint involvement. Psoriatic arthritis would usually have a history of psoriasis or psoriatic skin changes, which are not mentioned here. Therefore, the most likely cause of her symptoms is parvovirus arthritis.",9
9459,"The patient's symptoms and history are suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS). She has experienced episodes of neurological symptoms, such as partial vision loss (optic neuritis) and weakness/numbness in the legs, which are common in MS. The symptoms worsening with heat exposure (Uhthoff's phenomenon) also support this diagnosis. The neurological examination shows signs of upper motor neuron lesions, such as spasticity, hyperreflexia, and an extensor plantar response. The MRI being inconclusive does not rule out MS, as sometimes lesions may not be visible early in the disease. The most definitive test to support a diagnosis of MS in this context is the presence of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid, which indicates inflammation in the central nervous system.",9
9460,"The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are suggestive of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The key features include chronic lower back pain that is worse in the morning and improves with activity, stiffness, and sacroiliac joint involvement. The MRI findings of erosions and sclerosis of the sacroiliac joints further support this diagnosis. Ankylosing spondylitis is associated with extra-articular manifestations, one of which is anterior uveitis, leading to recurring eye redness and pain. This makes option D the most likely associated finding.",9
9457,"The patient has type II diabetes mellitus with an HbA1c of 7.6% after being on the maximum dose of metformin. She is also overweight with a BMI of 31 kg/m^2 and is interested in losing more weight. When considering a second agent for diabetes management, it's important to choose one that can help with both glycemic control and weight loss. 

Exenatide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist, which not only helps lower blood glucose levels but also promotes weight loss. This makes it an ideal choice for this patient who is looking to lose weight. 

Glipizide and repaglinide are insulin secretagogues that can cause weight gain, which would not be beneficial for this patient. Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor that is weight neutral, so it wouldn't help with weight loss.

Therefore, exenatide is the best choice as it addresses both glycemic control and the patient's desire for weight loss.",9
9456,"Phenoxybenzamine is a non-selective, irreversible alpha-adrenergic antagonist. When administered after epinephrine, it will block alpha receptors, leading to unopposed beta-adrenergic effects. Epinephrine normally stimulates both alpha and beta receptors. Blocking alpha receptors with phenoxybenzamine will reduce vasoconstriction and other alpha-mediated effects, while beta effects such as vasodilation (via beta-2 receptors) and increased insulin secretion (via beta-2 receptors) will be enhanced. Therefore, the most likely effect observed would be increased secretion of insulin due to unopposed beta-2 receptor stimulation.",9
9473,"The patient presents with symptoms and physical examination findings suggestive of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), such as lower back pain that worsens at night, morning stiffness, and reduced lumbar flexion with sacroiliac joint tenderness. The pelvic x-ray likely showed sacroiliitis, confirming the diagnosis. Indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is a first-line treatment for AS, but the patient has not improved after 6 weeks. Before considering biologic therapy, such as TNF inhibitors, it is important to screen for latent tuberculosis infection, as these medications can reactivate TB. Therefore, a PPD skin test is the most appropriate next step.",9
9465,"The quadruple screen measures levels of maternal serum α-fetoprotein (MSAFP), β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG), estriol, and inhibin A. In this case, the MSAFP is markedly elevated, while the other markers are normal. Elevated MSAFP is commonly associated with open neural tube defects such as spina bifida or anencephaly. Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) typically shows decreased MSAFP, increased β-hCG, decreased estriol, and increased inhibin A. Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) usually shows decreased MSAFP, β-hCG, and estriol, with normal inhibin A. Holoprosencephaly is not typically associated with elevated MSAFP. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the elevated MSAFP in this scenario is an open neural tube defect, such as spina bifida cystica.",9
9475,"The patient is experiencing an increase in viral load despite antiretroviral therapy, indicating resistance or failure of the current regimen. The new drug regimen includes an agent that binds to glycoprotein 41. Glycoprotein 41 is a component of the HIV envelope that plays a crucial role in the fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane. By binding to gp41, the drug inhibits the fusion process, preventing the virus from entering the host cell. This mechanism of action is specific to the inhibition of viral fusion and entry into host cells, rather than affecting viral assembly, docking, attachment, or genome transcription.",9
9478,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of nephrotic syndrome, characterized by significant proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and edema. The history of HIV infection is a key factor in determining the underlying cause of the nephrotic syndrome. In patients with HIV, one of the common renal pathologies is HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), which is typically associated with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The biopsy findings in FSGS would show segmental sclerosis of the glomeruli under light microscopy. Other options such as thickened glomerular capillary loops are more indicative of membranous nephropathy, crescent formation is seen in rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, and no changes would suggest minimal change disease, which is less common in adults and not typically associated with HIV.",9
9480,"The patient is a former coal miner with a history of prolonged exposure to coal dust, presenting with respiratory symptoms such as a persistent dry cough and shortness of breath. The chest X-ray findings of interstitial fibrosis with reticulonodular infiltrate and honeycombing are indicative of a pneumoconiosis. Coal worker's pneumoconiosis, also known as black lung disease, is characterized by these findings due to the inhalation of coal dust. Caplan syndrome involves rheumatoid arthritis and pneumoconiosis, which is not mentioned here. Asbestosis typically involves exposure to asbestos and presents with pleural plaques, which are not described. Bronchogenic carcinoma would more likely present with a mass rather than diffuse interstitial changes. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is coal worker's pneumoconiosis.",9
9434,,0
9479,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis: sudden onset of shortness of breath, rash, hypotension, and wheezing after eating at a seafood restaurant. Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that requires immediate treatment. The first-line treatment for anaphylaxis is intramuscular epinephrine, which acts quickly to counteract the symptoms by causing vasoconstriction, bronchodilation, and reducing vascular permeability. While other treatments like steroids and albuterol can be used adjunctively, they are not the immediate priority. Intubation is considered if there is airway compromise, but the first step is to administer epinephrine to stabilize the patient.",9
9488,"The patient's history and clinical findings are key to diagnosing his condition. He has a significant occupational exposure history, having worked in construction for 30 years, which is a risk factor for asbestosis. The presence of clubbing, wheezing, and particularly the chest radiograph findings of linear opacities at the lung bases and calcified pleural plaques are classic for asbestosis. These plaques are indicative of asbestos exposure, which is common in construction workers due to materials like insulation and roofing. The other options do not fit as well: Coal miner’s disease (pneumoconiosis) would be more common in coal miners and typically shows different radiographic findings; silicosis is associated with silica exposure and shows nodular opacities; hypersensitivity pneumonitis is related to inhaled organic antigens and presents differently both clinically and radiographically.",9
9483,"The newborn presents with bilious vomiting, which suggests an obstruction distal to the ampulla of Vater. The x-ray shows 3 gas shadows in the upper abdomen with a gasless distal abdomen, indicating a ""triple bubble"" sign. This is characteristic of jejunal atresia, where there is obstruction in the jejunum leading to proximal bowel distention and absence of gas in the distal bowel. The history of polyhydramnios during pregnancy also supports a diagnosis of intestinal atresia, as it can be associated with fetal inability to swallow amniotic fluid. Malrotation with volvulus would typically present with a ""corkscrew"" appearance on imaging and can cause bilious vomiting, but the x-ray findings here are more specific for jejunal atresia. Hirschsprung disease usually presents later with failure to pass meconium and abdominal distension, and hypertrophic pyloric stenosis presents with non-bilious projectile vomiting and is unlikely in a newborn this young.",9
9489,"The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of a cardiac event. He has severe, squeezing chest pain radiating to the left arm, along with nausea, dizziness, and diaphoresis, which are classic symptoms of myocardial ischemia. His risk factors include uncontrolled diabetes and hypercholesterolemia. The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in anterolateral leads, which is indicative of an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), a type of acute coronary syndrome. The relief of chest pain with nitroglycerin further supports a cardiac cause. GERD and esophageal spasm could cause chest pain but would not cause ST-segment elevation on ECG. Pulmonary embolism typically presents with different symptoms and would not cause ST-segment elevation in the anterolateral leads. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is acute coronary syndrome.",9
9490,"The patient has stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is on hemodialysis. In CKD, the kidneys are unable to excrete phosphate, leading to hyperphosphatemia. Additionally, the kidneys cannot convert enough vitamin D to its active form, calcitriol, resulting in decreased calcium absorption from the gut and hypocalcemia. The low calcium levels stimulate the parathyroid glands to secrete more parathyroid hormone (PTH), leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism. Therefore, in this patient, we would expect elevated PTH, decreased calcium, increased phosphate, and decreased calcitriol levels.",9
9492,"The clinical presentation suggests a case of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), which is often preceded by an infection. The patient had abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea the previous week, which could indicate a gastrointestinal infection. One common pathogen associated with GBS following gastrointestinal symptoms is Campylobacter jejuni, which is a gram-negative, oxidase-positive, comma-shaped bacterium. The neurological symptoms, such as weakness and reduced reflexes, align with GBS, which can follow a Campylobacter infection.",9
9494,"The patient is in active labor at 40 weeks of gestation with 80% effacement and 5 cm dilation, indicating she is progressing through labor. The question mentions a cardiotocograph, which likely shows fetal heart rate patterns. The absence of visible fetal parts or a prolapsed umbilical cord suggests there is no immediate obstetric emergency like cord prolapse. The most common issue that could be inferred from the cardiotocograph is fetal heart rate decelerations, possibly due to cord compression or uteroplacental insufficiency. Repositioning the mother can alleviate cord compression and improve fetal oxygenation, making it a reasonable initial step before considering more invasive interventions.",9
9497,"The patient is presenting with hematemesis and a history of esophageal varices due to cirrhosis. She is already on propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, for variceal bleeding prophylaxis. The acute management of variceal bleeding includes stabilizing the patient with IV fluids, administering IV octreotide to reduce portal pressure, and antibiotics like ceftriaxone to prevent infection. The next critical step is to perform endoscopy to confirm the source of bleeding and to apply endoscopic therapy, such as band ligation or sclerotherapy, to control the variceal hemorrhage. TIPS is considered if endoscopic and medical management fail. Fresh frozen plasma is not indicated here as her coagulation status is not provided, and her platelet count is normal. Therefore, the best next step is endoscopy.",9
9501,"The patient's symptoms of chest pain radiating to the back, ears, and neck, along with the absence of dyspnea on exertion, suggest a non-cardiac cause of chest pain. The referral for an upper GI barium swallow indicates suspicion of an esophageal issue. The most likely esophageal condition that could cause such symptoms is diffuse esophageal spasm or another motility disorder. These conditions would not typically show abnormalities on coronary angiogram, esophageal biopsy, or pulmonary function tests. However, they would show abnormalities on esophageal manometry, which measures the motility and function of the esophagus.",9
9502,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a renal pathology characterized by significant proteinuria, hypertension, and renal insufficiency. The key finding from the renal biopsy is the presence of eosinophilic, acellular material in the glomerular tuft and capillary walls that shows apple green birefringence under polarized light with Congo red staining. This is indicative of amyloid deposition, which is characteristic of amyloidosis. In the context of a 55-year-old African American male with back pain and fatigue, these findings are highly suggestive of multiple myeloma, a condition associated with AL amyloidosis due to light chain deposition. Membranous nephropathy and malignant hypertension do not typically present with these biopsy findings, and drug-induced acute tubular necrosis would not show these histological features.",9
9508,"The patient's symptoms and X-ray findings are consistent with osteoarthritis, characterized by joint pain that worsens with movement and improves with rest, along with joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, osteophytes, and subchondral cysts. The absence of redness or swelling suggests a non-inflammatory process, differentiating it from rheumatoid arthritis. The first-line pharmacotherapy for osteoarthritis is typically NSAIDs for pain relief. Ibuprofen is a non-selective NSAID, while celecoxib is a COX-2 selective NSAID, which may be preferred in patients with gastrointestinal concerns. However, given no specific contraindications or history of GI issues in this patient, ibuprofen is a reasonable choice for initial management.",9
9519,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of reactive arthritis, which is a type of spondyloarthritis that can occur after certain infections, commonly gastrointestinal or genitourinary. The classic triad of reactive arthritis includes arthritis, conjunctivitis, and urethritis. The history of gastroenteritis and the current symptoms of joint pain and conjunctivitis align with this diagnosis. 

In reactive arthritis, skin manifestations such as keratoderma blennorrhagicum (a type of skin rash) and circinate balanitis (a type of genital ulceration) can occur. DIP joint swelling is more characteristic of psoriatic arthritis, not reactive arthritis. Therefore, DIP joint swelling would be the least likely feature to develop in patients with reactive arthritis.",9
9472,"The patient presents with risk factors for tuberculosis (TB), including being a smoker, but there is no direct evidence of active TB. The tuberculin skin test shows 12 mm of induration in a high-risk individual (healthcare worker), which is considered positive, suggesting latent TB infection. The Ziehl-Neelsen stain is negative, indicating no current active TB visible in the sputum. The appropriate action in such cases, when there is no evidence of active TB but a positive skin test in a high-risk individual, is to treat for latent TB infection to prevent progression to active disease.

Isoniazid is the standard treatment for latent TB. The use of ethambutol is not indicated for latent TB without evidence of drug resistance or specific indications. The other options involve treatments for active TB or drug-resistant TB, which are not applicable here due to the lack of active disease evidence.

The recommendation at this point would be to consider treatment for latent TB infection, which involves isoniazid alone, not the combinations or repeated testing options.",6
9526,"The clinical presentation suggests septic shock, likely due to a urinary tract infection given the patient's symptoms and history. In septic shock, there is peripheral vasodilation leading to decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR). The cardiac output (CO) is typically increased as a compensatory mechanism to maintain perfusion despite the low SVR. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) is usually normal or decreased due to the vasodilation and relative hypovolemia. Mixed venous oxygen saturation (SaO2) can be slightly increased due to the high cardiac output and impaired tissue oxygen extraction. Therefore, the expected hemodynamic profile in septic shock would be normal or decreased PCWP, slightly increased SaO2, increased CO, and decreased SVR.",9
9535,"The patient's symptoms and the transient improvement in gait following the removal of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are indicative of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). NPH is characterized by the triad of gait disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, and urinary incontinence. The improvement in symptoms after CSF removal suggests that reducing CSF volume can alleviate the symptoms, which is consistent with NPH. The definitive treatment for NPH is the placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt to continuously drain excess CSF and relieve pressure. Other options like acetazolamide, endoscopic third ventriculostomy, and epidural blood patch are not appropriate for this condition. Therefore, the next step in management is to place a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.",9
9538,"Barrett's esophagus is a condition where the normal squamous epithelium of the esophagus is replaced with columnar epithelium due to chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This metaplastic change increases the risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma. Continuing omeprazole therapy helps manage GERD symptoms and may reduce the risk of progression to dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma is associated with different risk factors, such as smoking and alcohol use, and is not typically linked to Barrett's esophagus. Gastro-intestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and MALT lymphoma are unrelated to Barrett's esophagus. Therefore, the most probable long-term sequela of Barrett's esophagus is adenocarcinoma.",9
9484,"The clinical presentation is suspicious for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. The patient is hypotensive (blood pressure 77/45 mmHg) and tachycardic (pulse 121/min), suggesting hemodynamic instability, potentially due to internal bleeding. She also has a positive pregnancy test. The most likely cause in this scenario is an ectopic pregnancy, which may have ruptured, given her shock symptoms. In such cases, immediate surgical intervention is warranted, thus making exploratory laparoscopy the most appropriate next step to assess and manage a suspected ruptured ectopic.",9
9539,"The patient is experiencing recurrent episodes of gout, characterized by the presence of urate crystals in the joint fluid. For chronic management of gout, the goal is to reduce uric acid levels to prevent future attacks. Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that decreases uric acid production and is considered the first-line treatment for chronic gout management. Methotrexate is used for autoimmune conditions, colchicine is used for acute gout attacks and prophylaxis, and indomethacin is an NSAID used for acute attacks, not chronic management.",9
9540,"The patient presents with splenomegaly, night sweats, weight loss, anemia, and a leukoerythroblastic blood picture (teardrop-shaped and nucleated RBCs, immature myeloid cells). The bone marrow is difficult to aspirate, suggesting fibrosis. The JAK-2 mutation is positive, which is associated with myeloproliferative disorders. The negative TRAP test rules out hairy cell leukemia, and the absence of clonal plasma cells rules out multiple myeloma. The negative cytogenetic analysis for the Philadelphia chromosome (t(9;22)) rules out chronic myeloid leukemia. The combination of these findings, especially the marrow fibrosis and JAK-2 positivity, is most consistent with primary myelofibrosis.",9
9543,"The clinical presentation and histopathological findings suggest bullous pemphigoid, an autoimmune blistering disorder characterized by tense bullae and subepidermal blisters with eosinophilic infiltrate. To confirm the diagnosis, direct immunofluorescence (DIF) of a perilesional skin biopsy is the best next step. DIF would show linear deposition of IgG and C3 along the basement membrane zone, which is characteristic of bullous pemphigoid.",9
9546,"The patient presents with facial swelling, difficulty speaking, and swallowing, which are indicative of angioedema. She has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which are often treated with medications such as ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors can cause angioedema due to impaired bradykinin metabolism. This is because ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) normally breaks down bradykinin, and inhibition of this enzyme leads to increased levels of bradykinin, causing vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, resulting in angioedema. The normal serum C4 levels help rule out hereditary angioedema, which would typically show low C4 levels. Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms is impaired bradykinin metabolism due to ACE inhibitor use.",9
9542,"The patient is a 62-year-old woman who is up to date with her mammogram and Pap smear. Her colonoscopy was normal 5 years ago, so she does not need another one at this time. Her last influenza vaccine was 2 years ago, and since it is June, it is not the typical flu season, so the influenza vaccine is not immediately necessary. Her last tetanus booster was 6 years ago, and the tetanus vaccine is typically recommended every 10 years, so she does not need it now. She has never received the shingles vaccine, which is recommended for adults over 50 years old to prevent herpes zoster. Therefore, the most appropriate recommendation at this time is the shingles vaccine.",9
9555,"The patient has several risk factors that contribute to increased all-cause mortality, including smoking, hypertension, obesity, and elevated hemoglobin A1C. Among these, smoking is a major risk factor for a wide range of diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and respiratory diseases, and is a leading cause of preventable death. Smoking cessation has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of these conditions and improve overall mortality more than any other single intervention. While controlling blood pressure, managing diabetes, and increasing physical activity are important, the impact of smoking cessation on reducing all-cause mortality is the greatest.",9
9547,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), such as muscle pain and stiffness, particularly in the shoulders and hips, along with systemic symptoms like weight loss and fatigue. The elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) supports this diagnosis. Additionally, she has symptoms of temporal arteritis (also known as giant cell arteritis), including headaches, jaw claudication, and possibly visual symptoms. The combination of PMR and giant cell arteritis is common, especially in older adults. The elevated ESR and the presence of jaw pain while chewing (jaw claudication) strongly suggest giant cell arteritis as the cause of her headaches. Other options like chronic subdural hematoma, migraine, and temporomandibular joint dysfunction are less likely given the clinical presentation and associated symptoms.",9
9554,"The patient presents with easy bruising, bleeding, and steatorrhea (fatty, foul-smelling stools), which suggests malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins. The prolonged PT and PTT indicate a coagulation disorder. Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin necessary for the synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. A deficiency in vitamin K would lead to prolonged PT and PTT due to impaired synthesis of these factors. The normal ristocetin cofactor assay rules out von Willebrand disease, which would typically show an abnormal result. Hemophilia would primarily affect PTT and not PT, and ITP would present with thrombocytopenia, not prolonged PT/PTT. The history of cholecystectomy and symptoms of fat malabsorption suggest a post-surgical complication leading to vitamin K deficiency, causing the coagulation abnormalities.",9
9556,"The clinical presentation of fever, malaise, and bilateral parotid gland swelling in this 14-year-old boy is highly suggestive of mumps, especially given his recent travel to India and uncertain vaccination history. Mumps is a viral infection that primarily affects the parotid glands. One of the known complications of mumps in post-pubertal males is orchitis, which can lead to impaired fertility. While other complications like facial nerve palsy and diabetes mellitus can occur, they are less common. Osteomyelitis of the facial bone is not typically associated with mumps. Therefore, the greatest risk for this patient, considering his age and the typical complications of mumps, is impaired fertility due to potential orchitis.",9
9558,"The patient's symptoms include confusion, memory deficits, and mild weakness in the left leg, along with facial muscle weakness. The MRI findings show several hyperintense round lesions at the gray-white matter junction, which are characteristic of metastatic disease. Given her significant smoking history, lung cancer is a likely primary source of metastasis. Glioblastoma multiforme typically presents as a single lesion rather than multiple lesions. Multiple sclerosis is less likely given the patient's age and smoking history, and it typically presents with different MRI findings. Colorectal cancer could metastasize to the brain, but lung cancer is more common in this context.",9
9560,"The patient has been vomiting for three days, which leads to a loss of gastric acid (hydrochloric acid). This results in a metabolic alkalosis due to the loss of hydrogen ions. In metabolic alkalosis, we expect to see an elevated pH and an elevated bicarbonate (HCO3-) level. The body may attempt to compensate by hypoventilating to retain CO2, but this compensation is usually incomplete. 

Looking at the options:

- Option A shows a normal pH and normal bicarbonate, which does not fit the expected metabolic alkalosis.
- Option B shows a low pH and low bicarbonate, indicating metabolic acidosis, which is not consistent with vomiting.
- Option C shows an elevated pH and elevated bicarbonate, consistent with metabolic alkalosis.
- Option D shows an elevated pH but a low bicarbonate, which would indicate respiratory alkalosis with metabolic compensation, not consistent with vomiting.

Therefore, the expected result for this patient is metabolic alkalosis, which is best represented by option C.",9
9570,"The patient presents with hyponatremia (serum sodium of 115 mEq/L) and has a low serum osmolality with elevated antidiuretic hormone (ADH) levels. These findings are consistent with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), where ADH is elevated despite low serum osmolality, leading to water retention and dilutional hyponatremia. The chest X-ray shows no abnormalities, ruling out lung-related causes such as small cell lung cancer. In elderly patients with a seizure disorder, medications such as anticonvulsants (e.g., carbamazepine) are common causes of SIADH. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's hyponatremia is a medication effect.",9
9579,"The patient's presentation of crusting vesicular clusters on an erythematous base with surrounding edema is suggestive of dermatitis herpetiformis, which is associated with celiac disease. Dermatitis herpetiformis is characterized by intensely itchy vesicular eruptions, often on extensor surfaces. Celiac disease can lead to malabsorption, which may result in iron deficiency anemia due to poor absorption of iron. Therefore, the presence of iron deficiency anemia would support the diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis linked to celiac disease.",9
9577,"The patient's symptoms of fatigue, weight gain, constipation, myalgias, cold intolerance, and delayed deep tendon reflex relaxation are suggestive of hypothyroidism. In cases of suspected hypothyroidism, the best initial screening test is the serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level. An elevated TSH would indicate primary hypothyroidism, as the pituitary gland produces more TSH in response to low thyroid hormone levels. Other tests, such as anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies, are more specific for autoimmune thyroiditis but are not the initial screening test. Morning cortisol and plasma ACTH are used for adrenal insufficiency, and hemoglobin and hematocrit are used to evaluate anemia, neither of which fit the clinical picture as well as hypothyroidism.",9
9580,"The clinical presentation of the rash in the inguinal creases, scrotum, and gluteal cleft, along with the use of topical clotrimazole, suggests a diagnosis of a Candida infection, commonly known as a yeast diaper rash. Candida species, such as Candida albicans, are known to cause such infections. Microscopic examination of skin scrapings from a Candida infection typically reveals oval, budding yeast cells with pseudohyphae. This is characteristic of Candida species, which is why topical antifungal treatment like clotrimazole is used. Other options, such as fruiting bodies with septate hyphae or broad-based budding yeast, are indicative of different fungal organisms, such as Aspergillus or Blastomyces, respectively, which are not consistent with the clinical scenario described.",9
9581,"The patient presents with acute respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and bilateral crackles after a recent surgery with blood transfusions. The arterial blood gas shows hypoxemia with a normal PaCO2, indicating a primary issue with oxygenation rather than ventilation. The chest x-ray likely shows bilateral infiltrates. The echocardiogram shows normal left ventricular function, ruling out cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The warm extremities and lack of jugular venous distention also suggest non-cardiogenic causes. Given the recent transfusion, the clinical picture is consistent with transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), which is caused by diffuse inflammatory alveolar damage due to anti-leukocyte antibodies in the transfused blood. This leads to increased permeability pulmonary edema, explaining the patient's symptoms and findings.",9
9587,"The patient is a 25-year-old man with back pain that started after lifting a heavy box, which is worsened by movement and relieved by rest and ibuprofen. His vital signs are mostly normal, with a slight fever. The physical exam shows focal back pain lateral to the spine, without midline tenderness. His history includes smoking and IV drug use, but there are no signs of systemic infection or neurological deficits. The normal CRP and lack of midline tenderness make an epidural abscess less likely. An epidural hematoma would typically present with neurological deficits and more acute symptoms. A compression fracture is less likely given the patient's age and lack of trauma or osteoporosis risk factors. The presentation is most consistent with a muscle strain, which aligns with the history of lifting a heavy object and the relief with rest and NSAIDs.",9
9601,"The patient's symptoms and the response to edrophonium suggest a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is characterized by muscle weakness that worsens with activity and improves with rest, and it is caused by antibodies against the acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. The edrophonium test, which temporarily inhibits acetylcholinesterase, leads to increased acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction and improvement of symptoms, confirming the diagnosis. Myasthenia gravis is often associated with thymic abnormalities, such as thymoma or thymic hyperplasia. Thymic hyperplasia is a benign proliferation of epithelial cells of the thymus. Therefore, the correct association is with thymic hyperplasia or thymoma.",9
9596,"The patient is 22 weeks pregnant and reports decreased fetal movement. An ultrasound shows no fetal cardiac activity or movement, and a repeat scan confirms these findings. At 22 weeks, the pregnancy is beyond the first trimester, so the term 'missed abortion' is not typically used. 'Incomplete abortion' involves retained products of conception with some expulsion, which is not applicable here. 'Ectopic pregnancy' is unlikely given the gestational age and ultrasound findings. The most appropriate term for fetal death after 20 weeks of gestation is 'fetal demise.'",9
9599,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are suggestive of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS), particularly given the chronic nature of symptoms, mild tenderness of the prostate, and lack of significant findings on urinalysis. CP/CPPS is often treated with alpha-blockers, antibiotics, or a combination of both, even if bacterial infection is not confirmed, due to the potential presence of difficult-to-culture organisms or inflammation. Tamsulosin, an alpha-blocker, can help relieve urinary symptoms by relaxing the muscles in the prostate and bladder neck. Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic that can be used to cover potential bacterial causes. Therefore, the combination of tamsulosin and ciprofloxacin is appropriate for initial management of CP/CPPS.",9
9603,"The patient is on lithium for maintenance therapy of bipolar disorder and is concerned about its effects on a potential pregnancy. Lithium is known to be teratogenic, particularly associated with cardiac defects such as Ebstein's anomaly when used during the first trimester. However, abruptly discontinuing lithium can lead to a relapse of bipolar symptoms, which could be dangerous for both the mother and the fetus. The best approach is to continue lithium but at the lowest effective dose, with close monitoring. Supplementing with folate is generally recommended in pregnancy to prevent neural tube defects, but it does not mitigate the teratogenic effects of lithium. Adding another drug to the regimen could complicate the treatment and is not typically recommended without careful consideration. Discontinuing lithium after delivery is not relevant to the current concern about pregnancy. Therefore, the most appropriate recommendation is to continue lithium monotherapy with careful monitoring.",9
9605,"The patient has squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, and the development of sensorineural hearing loss after chemotherapy suggests the use of a drug known for this side effect. Cisplatin, a platinum-based chemotherapeutic agent, is commonly used in the treatment of lung cancer and is known to cause ototoxicity, leading to sensorineural hearing loss. Cisplatin works by forming DNA crosslinks, which inhibit DNA replication and transcription, leading to cell death. Therefore, the mechanism of action consistent with the drug causing the patient's hearing loss is a platinum-based DNA crosslinker.",9
9607,"This patient has severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with an FEV1 of 27% of predicted and resting oxygen saturation between 84-88%. In patients with COPD, long-term oxygen therapy is indicated when the resting PaO2 is ≤55 mm Hg or the oxygen saturation is ≤88%. Long-term oxygen therapy has been shown to improve survival in patients with severe resting hypoxemia. The other options, such as oral roflumilast, oral theophylline, and antibiotic therapy, do not have the same impact on survival as oxygen therapy in this context.",9
9608,"The patient has a history of calcium oxalate kidney stones, which are influenced by dietary factors. A high protein diet can increase the risk of kidney stones by increasing calcium and oxalate excretion in the urine. While calcium intake from dietary sources like yogurt is generally not a risk factor for calcium oxalate stones, excessive protein intake can contribute to stone formation. Therefore, reducing protein intake, particularly animal protein, can help decrease the risk of future stone formation. Increasing electrolytes, switching diabetes medication, or changing to a potassium-sparing diuretic are not directly related to reducing calcium oxalate stone risk.",9
9611,"The newborn in the scenario has a condition known as epispadias, where the urethral opening is on the dorsal side of the penis. This condition is due to a defect in the development of the genital tubercle. In males, the genital tubercle develops into the penis, while in females, it develops into the clitoris. Therefore, the female anatomical structure derived from the same embryonic structure affected in this patient (the genital tubercle) is the clitoris.",9
9513,"This 45-year-old man presents with symptoms and lab findings suggestive of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Key findings include his history of episodic hemoglobinuria (red-colored urine), scleral icterus (indicating high bilirubin from hemolysis), anemia, and abdominal pain. The laboratory findings show hemolytic anemia with low haptoglobin, elevated LDH, and high indirect bilirubin levels. The low presence of CD55 (a decay-accelerating factor that inhibits complement activation on red blood cells) suggests the diagnosis of PNH. PNH is characterized by hemolysis, bone marrow failure, and a propensity for thrombosis.

The severe abdominal pain and red urine are indicative of venous thrombosis, which is common in PNH due to the hypercoagulable state. Thrombosis is indeed a leading cause of death in PNH, often occurring in unusual sites such as hepatic veins leading to Budd-Chiari syndrome, mesenteric veins, or cerebral veins.

Among the choices for the most likely cause of mortality in PNH:

- **Budd-Chiari syndrome (D)** is a thrombosis of hepatic veins, which can occur in PNH and lead to liver failure, ascites, and eventually death. It is one of the classic sites for thrombosis in PNH.

- **Cerebral vein thrombosis (B)** is another possible site for thrombosis in PNH and can lead to death due to increased intracranial pressure or hemorrhagic stroke.

Considering that Budd-Chiari syndrome is a classical and common cause of mortality in patients with PNH due to the typical thrombosis in hepatic veins leading to liver damage and complications, it is the most likely cause of mortality in this scenario.",9
9617,"The patient's symptoms are suggestive of Cushing's syndrome, likely due to a pituitary adenoma (Cushing's disease). In Cushing's disease, the pituitary adenoma secretes excess ACTH, leading to increased cortisol production by the adrenal glands. In a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test, a pituitary adenoma will typically show suppression of cortisol production because the pituitary is still somewhat responsive to feedback inhibition by high doses of dexamethasone. Therefore, the expected findings would be cortisol suppression with a high baseline ACTH level, as the pituitary adenoma causes elevated ACTH production.",9
9616,"During pregnancy, estrogen increases the production of thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), which binds to thyroid hormones. This leads to an increase in total T4 levels as more hormone is bound to TBG. However, the free T4 level remains normal or slightly decreased, as seen in this patient. The low TSH is due to the increased levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) during early pregnancy, which can mildly stimulate the thyroid gland due to its structural similarity to TSH. Therefore, the most likely etiology of the laboratory findings is the estrogen-induced increase in TBG, which affects total T4 levels.",9
9618,"The patient is experiencing flushing, which is a common side effect of niacin (vitamin B3) used to treat dyslipidemia, particularly to increase HDL levels. The lab results show a very low HDL level, which might have prompted the physician to prescribe niacin. Flushing from niacin is due to prostaglandin-mediated vasodilation. Aspirin, which irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase, can reduce prostaglandin production and thus alleviate flushing. Therefore, the correct intervention to alleviate the flushing is the use of aspirin, which corresponds to the option of irreversible inactivation of cyclooxygenase.",9
9621,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest an immunodeficiency disorder. The patient has recurrent bacterial infections, particularly of the respiratory tract, which is common in antibody deficiencies. The key laboratory finding is the normal IgM level with decreased IgG and IgA levels. This pattern is characteristic of Hyper-IgM syndrome, where there is a defect in class switching from IgM to other immunoglobulin classes, leading to normal or elevated IgM and decreased IgG and IgA. Bruton agammaglobulinemia would present with low levels of all immunoglobulins, and common variable immunodeficiency typically presents later in life. Severe combined immunodeficiency would present with more severe infections and a lack of T cells.",9
9629,"The patient's symptoms include frequent headaches, decreased libido, and vision problems. These symptoms are suggestive of a pituitary adenoma. Headaches and vision problems, particularly bitemporal hemianopsia, are common due to the mass effect of the adenoma on surrounding structures, such as the optic chiasm. Decreased libido can be due to hormonal imbalances caused by the adenoma. 

Lactotroph adenomas (prolactinomas) are the most common type of pituitary adenoma and can cause decreased libido due to elevated prolactin levels, which can suppress gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and subsequently reduce levels of sex hormones. The vision problems and headaches are due to the tumor's size and pressure effects.

Corticotroph adenomas cause Cushing's disease, which is not indicated by the symptoms presented. Thyrotroph adenomas cause hyperthyroidism, which is also not indicated here. Gonadotroph adenomas are usually non-functioning and less likely to present with these symptoms.

Therefore, the most likely type of adenoma given the symptoms is a lactotroph adenoma.",9
9624,"The patient is experiencing worsening asthma despite being on high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting beta-agonist (salmeterol). The addition of a medication that results in downregulation of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) on mast cells and basophils suggests the use of a monoclonal antibody targeting IgE. Omalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to IgE, preventing it from attaching to FcεRI on mast cells and basophils, thereby reducing allergic inflammation and asthma symptoms. This mechanism is consistent with the description provided in the question. Zileuton is a leukotriene synthesis inhibitor, theophylline is a bronchodilator, and infliximab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor, none of which have the described mechanism of action.",9
9626,"The patient is a 62-year-old man with a skin lesion on his nose that has been present for 11 months and has increased in size. He is a farmer, suggesting significant sun exposure, which is a risk factor for skin cancers. His family history includes a mother who died of metastatic melanoma, indicating a potential genetic predisposition to skin cancer. The lesion is nontender and located on the nose, a common site for basal cell carcinoma (BCC) due to sun exposure. BCC typically presents as a pearly or translucent nodule, often with telangiectasia, and can ulcerate or appear as a non-healing sore. Molluscum contagiosum usually presents as small, umbilicated papules, which is less likely given the patient's age and lesion characteristics. Keratoacanthoma is a rapidly growing lesion that resembles squamous cell carcinoma but often resolves spontaneously, which doesn't match the slow growth over 11 months. Actinic keratosis is a precursor to squamous cell carcinoma and presents as rough, scaly patches, which is less likely given the description of the lesion. Given the patient's age, sun exposure, and lesion characteristics, basal cell carcinoma is the most likely diagnosis.",9
9614,"The clinical presentation suggests a congenital heart defect causing cyanosis, particularly during exertion or stress, such as crying or feeding. The episodes of cyanosis and poor weight gain are indicative of a condition that causes right-to-left shunting or decreased pulmonary blood flow.

The key details are:
- Cyanosis during exertion (crying, feeding)
- Low oxygen saturation (90%)
- Poor weight gain

These symptoms are consistent with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), a condition characterized by:
1. Ventricular septal defect (VSD)
2. Right ventricular outflow tract obstruction
3. Overriding aorta
4. Right ventricular hypertrophy

In TOF, the right ventricular outflow tract obstruction leads to right ventricular hypertrophy, which would manifest as right axis deviation on an ECG. The cyanosis occurs because of right-to-left shunting across the VSD, especially during exertion when systemic vascular resistance decreases.

Other options:
- A machine-like hum (B) is associated with patent ductus arteriosus, which typically causes a continuous murmur and does not fit the cyanotic episodes described.
- Anomalous pulmonary venous return (C) would cause cyanosis but is less likely to present with the specific episodic cyanosis during exertion.
- A diminutive left ventricle (D) would suggest hypoplastic left heart syndrome, which presents differently and is usually detected earlier.

Therefore, the most likely finding is right axis deviation on ECG, consistent with right ventricular hypertrophy in TOF.",9
9633,"The patient's symptoms and history are indicative of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Key features include unstable interpersonal relationships, impulsivity, emotional instability, and self-harming behavior. The patient describes intense and rapidly changing moods, which are often triggered by interpersonal interactions, a hallmark of BPD. His relationships are characterized by idealization and devaluation, and he exhibits fear of abandonment, as seen in his reaction to his girlfriend suggesting time apart. The presence of self-harm (cutting) to cope with feelings of emptiness further supports this diagnosis. While bipolar disorders involve mood changes, they are typically more episodic and not as reactive to interpersonal situations. Histrionic personality disorder involves attention-seeking behavior but lacks the self-harm and intense fear of abandonment seen here.",9
9636,"The patient presents with signs and symptoms consistent with advanced liver disease, likely cirrhosis, given the jaundice, palmar erythema, spider nevi, ascites (shifting dullness), and coagulopathy (elevated INR). The history of alcohol use and the negative hepatitis serology further support alcohol-related liver disease. In cirrhosis, the liver undergoes architectural changes characterized by fibrosis and the formation of regenerative nodules. This is described as fibrous bands surrounding regenerating hepatocytes. The other options do not fit the clinical picture: iron accumulation (A) is related to hemochromatosis, ground-glass hepatocytes (B) are associated with hepatitis B, and misfolded protein aggregates (D) are related to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.",9
9630,"The patient has an incidentally discovered adrenal nodule and symptoms suggestive of possible Cushing's syndrome, such as weight gain, difficult-to-control diabetes, and hypertension. The best initial test to evaluate for Cushing's syndrome is the 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test. This test helps determine if there is excessive cortisol production, which could be due to an adrenal adenoma or other causes of Cushing's syndrome. Other options like the ACTH stimulation test are used for adrenal insufficiency, and inferior petrosal sampling is used for differentiating the source of ACTH in confirmed Cushing's disease. A CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is not the initial step for evaluating hormonal activity of an adrenal nodule.",9
9647,"The patient has a history of breast cancer and now presents with osteolytic lesions in the thoracic spine, suggesting metastatic spread. Breast cancer commonly metastasizes to the bone, and the vertebral column is a frequent site due to the Batson's plexus (vertebral venous plexus), which is a network of valveless veins that allows for hematogenous spread of cancer cells. The azygos vein is part of this venous system and provides a route for metastasis from the breast to the spine. Therefore, the metastatic spread to the thoracic spine is most likely via the azygos vein.",9
9637,"The boy in the vignette exhibits several key features that align with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). He has social difficulties, such as being a solitary child without many friends and not making eye contact. He also has restricted interests, as evidenced by his obsession with collecting rocks. His speech is slightly labored, but his grammar and vocabulary are normal, which suggests he has some communication difficulties but not severe ones. His ability to recreate cartoon characters in great detail indicates a specific skill or talent, which is sometimes seen in individuals with ASD. The fact that he is meeting all developmental milestones and has normal grammar and vocabulary suggests a higher functioning level of ASD. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Autism Spectrum Disorder, level 1, which corresponds to individuals who require support but are relatively high functioning.",9
9648,"The patient's symptoms and urinalysis findings suggest nephrolithiasis (kidney stones). The presence of dumbbell-shaped crystals in the urine is characteristic of calcium oxalate crystals. Calcium oxalate stones are the most common type of kidney stones and can form in acidic urine, which is consistent with the patient's urine pH of 5.1. The other options do not match the description of dumbbell-shaped crystals: magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) crystals are typically coffin-lid shaped, cystine crystals are hexagonal, and ammonium urate crystals are thorn-apple shaped.",9
9650,"The patient's symptoms and lab findings suggest hyperaldosteronism, which is characterized by hypertension, hypokalemia, and hypernatremia. Aldosterone is the hormone responsible for these effects, as it increases sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion in the kidneys. Aldosterone is secreted by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex. Therefore, the hormone causing this patient's presentation is aldosterone, and it is secreted by the zona glomerulosa.",9
9657,"The question describes a 3-year-old girl with normocytic anemia, a family history of anemia and thrombotic events, and findings suggestive of hemolytic anemia. The options provided describe different pathophysiologic mechanisms of various hematologic conditions. 

- Option A describes paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, which involves complement sensitivity.
- Option B describes sickle cell disease, which is caused by a recessive mutation in the beta-globin gene leading to sickle-shaped red blood cells.
- Option C describes G6PD deficiency, an X-linked recessive condition causing sensitivity to oxidative stress.
- Option D describes conditions associated with cold agglutinin disease.

Given the context of the question, option B is the correct description of sickle cell disease, which matches the family history of anemia and potential thrombotic events due to sickled cells causing vaso-occlusion.",9
9654,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are suggestive of a rotator cuff pathology. The pain localized to the top of the shoulder, worsened with movement, and the inability to perform overhead activities like brushing hair or playing tennis are consistent with rotator cuff issues. The pain between 60 and 120 degrees of abduction is known as the painful arc, which is typical for rotator cuff problems. The inability to hold the arm up when lowering it from 90 degrees of abduction is indicative of a positive drop arm test, which is highly suggestive of a rotator cuff tear, particularly involving the supraspinatus muscle. The fact that the injection of lidocaine into the subacromial space did not relieve the pain or improve the range of motion further supports a structural tear rather than inflammation, which would be more responsive to lidocaine if it were bursitis. Cervical radiculopathy would likely present with neck pain and neurological symptoms, which are not described here. Biceps tendinitis would typically present with anterior shoulder pain and tenderness over the bicipital groove, which is not the case here. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a rotator cuff tear.",9
9668,"The key features in this scenario include the girl's lack of interaction with peers, ignoring her parents, avoiding eye contact, and repetitive behavior (drawing circles). These symptoms are characteristic of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) typically involves inattention and hyperactivity but not necessarily the social and communication deficits seen here. Childhood disintegrative disorder involves a regression in multiple areas of functioning after at least two years of normal development, which is not described here. Rett syndrome is primarily seen in females and involves regression and loss of purposeful hand skills, but it also includes neurological abnormalities, which are not present in this case. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Autism Spectrum Disorder.",9
9665,"The patient's symptoms and the presence of urine pooling in the vaginal vault suggest a possible vesicovaginal fistula, especially given the recent surgical history of bilateral tubal ligation. A vesicovaginal fistula can cause continuous leakage of urine into the vagina. To confirm the diagnosis of a vesicovaginal fistula, a dye test such as methylene blue instillation into the bladder is often used. If there is a fistula, the dye will leak into the vaginal vault, confirming the diagnosis. Other options like cystoscopy or imaging might be used later, but the dye test is a simple and effective initial diagnostic step.",9
9662,"The patient's symptoms of dry eyes, difficulty swallowing, dry oral mucosa, and parotid gland enlargement suggest Sjögren's syndrome. This condition is characterized by autoimmune destruction of exocrine glands, leading to dryness of the mouth and eyes. The family history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, another autoimmune condition, supports the likelihood of an autoimmune etiology. In Sjögren's syndrome, common serological markers include anti-SS-A (Ro) and anti-SS-B (La) antibodies. Therefore, the serology most likely to be positive in this patient is anti-SS-A.",10
9673,"The patient presents with microcytic anemia (low MCV) and target cells on the peripheral blood smear. She is of Italian descent, which raises the suspicion for a hemoglobinopathy common in Mediterranean populations, such as beta-thalassemia. The lack of response to iron supplementation suggests that the anemia is not due to iron deficiency. Beta-thalassemia is caused by a mutation in the beta-globin gene, leading to reduced or absent beta-globin chain production, resulting in microcytic anemia and target cells. The other options do not fit the clinical picture: 

- A. Ferrochelatase and ALA dehydratase inhibition is associated with lead poisoning, which would not typically present with target cells or be unresponsive to iron.
- C. Mutation in the δ-ALA synthase gene is related to sideroblastic anemia, which would show ringed sideroblasts on bone marrow examination.
- D. Vitamin B12 deficiency causes macrocytic anemia, not microcytic.

Therefore, the most likely underlying cause is a mutation in the beta-globin gene.",9
9675,"The clinical presentation of this patient, including gynecomastia, elongated limbs, small testicles, and elevated plasma gonadotropins, is suggestive of Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY). In Klinefelter syndrome, there is testicular dysgenesis leading to decreased testosterone production. The decreased testosterone results in less negative feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary, causing elevated levels of gonadotropins (FSH and LH). The increased LH stimulates aromatase activity, which converts androgens to estrogens, leading to elevated estrogen levels and gynecomastia. Therefore, the enzyme aromatase is likely to be elevated in this patient.",9
9677,"The patient's symptoms and the presence of a pituitary adenoma suggest Cushing's disease, which is a form of Cushing's syndrome caused by an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma. In this condition, the excess ACTH stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce more cortisol. The chronic stimulation by ACTH leads to diffuse hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex as the glands are overactive in response to the increased ACTH levels.",9
9688,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of malabsorption, including foul-smelling diarrhea, bulky and floating stools, flatulence, weight loss, and a fracture from a minor fall, indicating possible bone density issues. The skin lesions described as grouped, papulovesicular, and pruritic are characteristic of dermatitis herpetiformis, which is associated with celiac disease. Additionally, areas of hypoesthesia could suggest nutritional deficiencies, possibly due to malabsorption. Celiac disease is an autoimmune condition triggered by gluten, and the most useful test for diagnosing it is the detection of anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies.",9
9692,"The patient is experiencing auditory hallucinations and delusions of reference and persecution, which are symptoms consistent with schizophrenia. She has been experiencing these symptoms for over a year, indicating a chronic condition. The most appropriate long-term treatment for schizophrenia involves the use of antipsychotic medications. Quetiapine and fluphenazine are both antipsychotics, but quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic, which is generally preferred for long-term management due to a better side effect profile compared to typical antipsychotics like fluphenazine. Clozapine is reserved for treatment-resistant schizophrenia due to its risk of agranulocytosis. Lithium carbonate is used for mood stabilization in bipolar disorder, not schizophrenia. Therefore, quetiapine is the most appropriate choice for long-term treatment in this case.",9
9693,"The patient developed a urinary tract infection (UTI) as indicated by the positive nitrites and leukocytes in the urine. This likely occurred due to the insertion of a Foley catheter, which is a common risk factor for UTIs in hospitalized patients. The laboratory values do not show any abnormalities directly related to systemic steroid use, such as hyperglycemia or electrolyte imbalances, that would suggest avoiding steroids as a preventive measure. Sterile technique is important but does not specifically address the prevention of UTIs from catheter use. Intermittent catheterization reduces the risk of infection compared to indwelling catheters. Therefore, the measure that would have prevented the UTI is intermittent catheterization.",9
9694,"The patient's symptoms and ultrasound findings are suggestive of a hydatid cyst, likely caused by Echinococcus granulosus. The presence of a unilocular cyst with daughter cysts in the liver is characteristic of this condition. The most appropriate initial management for a hydatid cyst is to administer oral albendazole to reduce the risk of cyst rupture and to sterilize the cyst before any potential surgical intervention. Other options like ERCP, metronidazole, or clindamycin are not appropriate for this condition.",9
9702,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings are consistent with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in a child. In ALL, certain chromosomal abnormalities are associated with different prognoses. Trisomy 4 and trisomy 10 are generally associated with a favorable prognosis. The t(12;21) translocation, which results in the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion, is also associated with a favorable prognosis in pediatric ALL. However, the t(9;22) translocation, also known as the Philadelphia chromosome, is associated with an unfavorable prognosis in ALL, even in children. This translocation results in the BCR-ABL fusion protein, which is more commonly associated with chronic myeloid leukemia but can occur in ALL and is linked to a poorer outcome.",9
9705,"The patient is a 22-year-old female with a low BMI of 17, indicating she is underweight. She has dry mucous membranes, multiple dental caries, and calluses on the dorsum of her right hand. The calluses, known as Russell's sign, are typically associated with self-induced vomiting. The dental caries and dry mucous membranes can also be related to frequent vomiting. These findings suggest a pattern of purging behavior. While bulimia nervosa involves normal or above-normal weight with binge eating followed by purging, anorexia nervosa - purging type involves being underweight with similar purging behaviors. Given her low BMI, the most likely diagnosis is anorexia nervosa - purging type.",9
9711,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS), characterized by fever, rash, hypotension, and multi-system involvement. The rash is diffuse and desquamating, which is typical of TSS. The hypotension and tachycardia indicate shock. The purulent vaginal discharge suggests a possible source of infection. TSS is most commonly associated with Staphylococcus aureus, which are gram-positive cocci in clusters. Staphylococcus aureus produces superantigens, such as toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), which can lead to the symptoms observed in this patient. Therefore, the organism responsible is best described as gram-positive cocci in clusters producing superantigens.",9
9713,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), which is often caused by medications such as NSAIDs, antibiotics, and others. The key findings supporting this diagnosis are the presence of eosinophils in the urine and the recent use of meloxicam, an NSAID. AIN is characterized histologically by interstitial infiltration of inflammatory cells, predominantly T-cells and eosinophils. The maculopapular rash, fever, and eosinophiluria are classic signs of a hypersensitivity reaction, which aligns with AIN. Therefore, the histologic examination of the kidney biopsy would most likely show interstitial T-cell infiltration.",9
9716,"The patient presents with jaundice, fatigue, weight loss, and a history of acute pancreatitis. The lab results show a cholestatic pattern with elevated alkaline phosphatase and direct hyperbilirubinemia, suggesting an obstruction in the biliary system. The history of pancreatitis and the current symptoms raise suspicion for pancreatic cancer, particularly in the head of the pancreas, which can cause obstruction of the common bile duct. This obstruction can lead to a distended gallbladder, known as Courvoisier's sign, due to the back-up of bile. Therefore, on abdominal imaging, a distended gallbladder is likely to be seen.",9
9676,,0
9719,"The patient presents with flank pain, fever, and a scrotal bulge, along with a history of weight loss and smoking. The ultrasound finding of bilateral kidney stones suggests a possible underlying condition. The combination of these symptoms, particularly the scrotal bulge, raises suspicion for a renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which can present with a varicocele due to obstruction of the left renal vein. RCC is also associated with paraneoplastic syndromes, one of which is polycythemia due to ectopic erythropoietin production, leading to increased hematocrit. Therefore, the finding associated with the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms (RCC) is increased hematocrit.",9
9718,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue, weight gain, dry skin, coarse hair, and depression. The laboratory finding of a slightly elevated TSH (5.3 µU/mL) supports this suspicion, indicating possible primary hypothyroidism. In primary hypothyroidism, especially Hashimoto's thyroiditis, anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies are commonly elevated. The other antibody options are associated with different conditions: Anti-DNA topoisomerase antibodies are associated with systemic sclerosis, anti-nuclear antibodies are nonspecific but often seen in autoimmune diseases, and anti-histidyl-tRNA synthetase antibodies are associated with polymyositis/dermatomyositis. Given the clinical presentation and lab findings, anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies are most likely to be abnormal.",9

9720,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with acute gout, characterized by severe pain and swelling of the great toe (podagra) and a history of similar episodes. The presence of a nodule over the elbow suggests a tophus, which is also associated with gout. Her alcohol consumption, particularly beer, can contribute to hyperuricemia, a risk factor for gout. The most appropriate treatment for an acute gout attack is to reduce inflammation and pain. NSAIDs are commonly used for this purpose. Among the options, reversible inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis (A) describes the mechanism of action of NSAIDs like ibuprofen, which are used to treat acute gout attacks. Irreversible inhibition of cyclooxygenase (B) describes aspirin, which is not typically used for acute gout due to its effects on uric acid levels. Selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (C) describes COX-2 inhibitors like celecoxib, which can also be used for pain but are not the first-line treatment for acute gout. Irreversible inhibition of xanthine oxidase (D) describes allopurinol, which is used for chronic management of gout to lower uric acid levels, not for acute attacks.",9
9725,"The patient's symptoms and findings are suggestive of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), a type of seronegative spondyloarthropathy. The key features include lower back pain that improves with activity, morning stiffness, decreased chest expansion, and sacroiliac joint involvement. The elevated ESR and leukocyte count indicate inflammation. The x-ray findings of sacroiliac joint erosion and sclerosis further support AS. In AS, enthesitis, or inflammation at tendon insertion sites, is common, particularly at the Achilles tendon. This makes option C, tenderness at the Achilles tendon insertion site, the most likely finding upon further evaluation.",9

9721,"To calculate the risk of contracting influenza during the second week, we need to determine the number of students at risk at the beginning of the second week and how many contracted influenza during that week.

Initially, there are 20 students. In the first week, 2 students contract influenza, leaving 18 students at risk at the start of the second week.

During the second week, 3 more students contract influenza.

The risk of contracting influenza during the second week is calculated as the number of new cases during the second week divided by the number of students at risk at the beginning of the second week:

Risk = (Number of new cases in the second week) / (Number of students at risk at the start of the second week)

Risk = 3 / 18 = 0.1667, which rounds to 0.17.

Therefore, the risk of contracting influenza during the second week is 0.17.",9
9726,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), such as intense headache, nausea, nuchal rigidity, and a positive Kernig sign. The CT scan is negative, which can occur in some cases of SAH, especially if performed after a delay. In such cases, a lumbar puncture is the next step to look for xanthochromia or red blood cells in the cerebrospinal fluid, which would confirm SAH. MRI is not typically used for acute SAH diagnosis, angiography is used after SAH is confirmed to identify aneurysms, and sonography is not relevant here.",9
9727,"The patient presents with hypercholesterolemia and is prescribed a hypolipidemic drug. On follow-up, he reports muscle pains and elevated serum transaminases. These symptoms are characteristic of statin use, which is known to cause muscle-related side effects (myopathy, myalgia) and can also lead to elevated liver enzymes. Atorvastatin is a statin and is the most likely drug to cause these symptoms. Colestipol is a bile acid sequestrant and does not typically cause muscle pain or elevated liver enzymes. Glyceryl trinitrate is a nitrate used for angina and is not a hypolipidemic drug. Gemfibrozil is a fibrate, which can cause muscle pain, especially when used with statins, but the scenario suggests a single drug causing the symptoms, making atorvastatin the most likely culprit.",9
9733,"The infant presents with symptoms of respiratory distress, including fever, cough, nasal congestion, poor feeding, and wheezing. The age of the infant (6 weeks old) and the symptoms are suggestive of bronchiolitis, which is a common respiratory condition in infants. The most common cause of bronchiolitis in this age group is Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). The presence of wheezing, nasal flaring, and retractions further supports this diagnosis. Other options like Parainfluenza virus, Rhinovirus, and Streptococcus agalactiae are less likely to cause this specific presentation in a 6-week-old infant.",9
9737,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE), given her use of hydralazine, a known cause of DILE. The symptoms include pleuritic chest pain that improves when sitting up and leaning forward, which is consistent with pericarditis, a common manifestation of lupus. The swollen joints and negative antinuclear antibody (ANA) test further support DILE, as ANA can be negative in this condition. The key serological marker for DILE is the presence of anti-histone antibodies.",9
9735,"The patient is presenting with symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with HELLP syndrome (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelet count) and severe preeclampsia, as evidenced by hypertension, proteinuria, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, and now seizures (eclampsia). The definitive treatment for eclampsia is delivery of the baby, as this resolves the underlying condition. While magnesium sulfate is used to prevent further seizures, it is not the definitive treatment. Betamethasone is used for fetal lung maturity but is not the definitive treatment in this acute scenario. Platelet transfusion may be considered if there is significant bleeding risk, but it does not address the underlying cause. Therefore, the most appropriate definitive treatment is delivery, typically via cesarean section in this urgent context.",9
9743,"The patient is experiencing shortness of breath and hypoxia following surgery, with an oxygen saturation of 85%. The physical exam reveals diminished breath sounds on the left side and intercostal retractions, suggesting a possible issue with lung expansion or ventilation. The chest x-ray shows bilateral fluffy infiltrates and a shift of the cardiac silhouette to the left. These findings are consistent with atelectasis, which is common postoperatively, especially in patients with scoliosis or other thoracic deformities that can impair lung expansion. Atelectasis involves collapsed alveoli, leading to impaired gas exchange and hypoxia. The bilateral fluffy infiltrates could also suggest pulmonary edema, but the shift of the cardiac silhouette and diminished breath sounds are more indicative of atelectasis. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the hypoxia is collapsed alveoli.",9
9738,"Atracurium is a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent used in anesthesia. It is often chosen in patients with liver or kidney impairment because it undergoes Hofmann elimination, a process that is independent of organ function. This means that atracurium is broken down in the plasma and tissues at physiological pH and temperature, making it suitable for patients with compromised liver or kidney function, such as this patient with alcoholic cirrhosis. Other neuromuscular blockers may rely on hepatic or renal pathways for elimination, which could be problematic in this patient.",9
9744,"The patient has a history of head trauma followed by a lucid interval and then neurological deterioration, which is suggestive of an epidural hematoma. The presentation of a severe headache, nausea, and unilateral weakness (left leg weakness) indicates a mass effect on the brain. The presence of a bruise on the right side of the skull suggests a possible epidural hematoma on the right side, which could cause a shift of brain structures. The unilateral weakness on the left side suggests that the right hemisphere is affected, likely due to a subfalcine herniation. Subfalcine herniation occurs when brain tissue is displaced under the falx cerebri, often leading to compression of the anterior cerebral artery and resulting in contralateral leg weakness. The absence of pupillary changes and the specific unilateral leg weakness further support this diagnosis.",9
9754,"The infant presents with signs consistent with congenital infection, including fever, lethargy, and a heart murmur. The pearly white appearance of the lenses suggests cataracts. These findings are characteristic of congenital rubella syndrome, which is caused by a Togavirus. The mother's recent immigration from Sudan and lack of prenatal care increase the likelihood of rubella infection, as vaccination coverage may be lower in some regions. The heart murmur could be due to a patent ductus arteriosus, commonly associated with congenital rubella. Other options like protozoan (e.g., Toxoplasma), herpesvirus (e.g., CMV), and spirochete (e.g., syphilis) do not typically present with cataracts and the specific combination of symptoms seen here.",9
9751,"The patient is exhibiting signs of delirium, characterized by acute onset of fluctuating consciousness, confusion, and hallucinations. Delirium is often seen in hospitalized elderly patients, especially after surgery. It is typically reversible and can be caused by various factors such as infections, trauma, or polypharmacy. Anticholinergic medications can actually worsen delirium, not alleviate it. Beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are associated with Alzheimer's disease, not delirium. Delirium is not an irreversible condition and is not a normal part of aging.",10
9755,"The clinical presentation is consistent with minimal change disease, which is characterized by nephrotic syndrome in children. This condition leads to significant proteinuria due to podocyte foot process effacement, resulting in hypoalbuminemia. The hypoalbuminemia decreases the plasma oncotic pressure, which in turn reduces the glomerular oncotic pressure. This reduction in oncotic pressure within the glomerulus leads to an increase in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as the driving force for filtration is increased due to the lower opposing oncotic pressure.",9
9759,"The neonate is presenting with symptoms and radiographic findings suggestive of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a serious gastrointestinal problem that mostly affects premature infants. The distended abdomen, diminished bowel sounds, and intraluminal gas (pneumatosis intestinalis) are classic signs. NEC can lead to bowel perforation and sepsis, requiring urgent intervention. In severe cases, especially with signs of bowel perforation or necrosis, surgical intervention is necessary to remove the affected bowel segments. Given the severity of the symptoms and the X-ray findings, surgery is the best next step for this patient.",9
9762,"The patient presents with irregular menstrual cycles, obesity, hirsutism, acne, and elevated blood glucose, which are suggestive of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is often associated with insulin resistance, which can lead to elevated blood glucose levels. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for managing irregular menses and providing contraception in a patient with PCOS is combination oral contraceptives. These help regulate menstrual cycles, reduce androgen levels, and improve acne and hirsutism. Metformin is also used in PCOS to address insulin resistance, but the primary concern here is menstrual irregularity and contraception, making combination oral contraceptives the most suitable choice.",9
9764,"A mutation that causes the recruitment of a releasing factor before the full peptide is completed results in premature termination of translation. This is characteristic of a nonsense mutation, where a stop codon is introduced prematurely in the mRNA sequence, leading to an incomplete and usually nonfunctional protein. This is distinct from a missense mutation, which results in a different amino acid being incorporated, a basepair wobble, which refers to flexibility in base pairing at the third codon position, and a single nucleotide polymorphism, which is a variation at a single position in DNA that may or may not affect protein function.",9
9767,"The question describes a substance that binds to an allosteric site on a globular portion of a heavy chain dimer, which is likely referring to myosin. Myosin is a motor protein with a globular head that interacts with actin during muscle contraction. The binding affinity of the substance decreases when the globular head of myosin binds to actin, suggesting that the substance binds more strongly when myosin is not interacting with actin.

During muscle contraction, the sarcomere shortens as actin and myosin filaments slide past each other. The I band (A) contains only actin filaments and shortens during contraction. The H band (B) contains only myosin filaments and also shortens during contraction. The A band (C) contains the entire length of the myosin filaments and remains constant in length during contraction. The M line (D) is the center of the sarcomere where myosin filaments are anchored.

Since the substance binds with greater affinity when myosin is not interacting with actin, it would have the greatest affinity in regions where myosin is not bound to actin. During contraction, the H band (B) is the region where myosin is not overlapping with actin, as it contains only myosin filaments. Therefore, the substance would have the greatest affinity in the H band during muscle contraction.",9
9770,"The clinical presentation of the child is suggestive of Angelman syndrome. Key features include developmental delay, seizures, a happy demeanor with frequent laughter, ataxia, and microcephaly. The wide-based stance, increased muscle tone, and hyperreflexia are consistent with neurological involvement seen in Angelman syndrome. The mechanism behind Angelman syndrome is typically a microdeletion of the maternal 15q11-q13 region, which leads to the loss of function of the UBE3A gene in the brain. This is distinct from Prader-Willi syndrome, which involves a microdeletion of the paternal 15q11-q13 region. The other options, such as MECP2 gene mutation and microdeletion of 22q11.2, are associated with Rett syndrome and DiGeorge syndrome, respectively, which do not match the clinical picture presented here.",9
9769,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest she is experiencing panic attacks. These are characterized by sudden episodes of intense fear, chest pain, sweating, and a feeling of impending doom, often without any cardiac pathology. The best long-term pharmacological treatment for panic disorder is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), such as paroxetine. Benzodiazepines can be used for acute management but are not suitable for long-term treatment due to the risk of dependence. Phenelzine, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, and nortriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, are not first-line treatments for panic disorder due to their side effect profiles and dietary restrictions (in the case of MAOIs).",9
9771,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible autoimmune condition. She has recurrent second-trimester miscarriages, joint pain, skin rashes, Raynaud's phenomenon (fingers becoming pale and cold), and livedo reticularis (purple reticular rash). These are indicative of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), which is associated with recurrent miscarriages and thrombotic events. APS is often diagnosed by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, such as anticardiolipin antibodies. Testing for these antibodies would confirm the diagnosis of APS, which aligns with her clinical presentation.",9

9774,"Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist that is often used in patients with heart failure to improve outcomes. One of the most significant side effects of spironolactone is hyperkalemia, due to its potassium-sparing effects in the distal nephron. This is particularly important in patients who are also on ACE inhibitors like captopril, as these can also increase potassium levels. While gynecomastia is a known side effect of spironolactone, it is not as immediately dangerous as hyperkalemia. Azotemia and alkalosis are not directly associated with spironolactone use. Therefore, the most critical complication to monitor for in this patient is hyperkalemia.",9
9775,"The child in the scenario is 18 months old and demonstrates several developmental milestones: walking alone, running, feeding himself with a spoon, drinking from a cup, scribbling, babbling, and saying 'mama'. He also points to show interest in objects, which is a good sign of social communication. However, at 18 months, a child is typically expected to have a vocabulary of around 10-25 words and should be able to say more than just 'mama'. The limited speech could be a concern for a hearing issue, which is a common cause of speech delay. Therefore, an audiology evaluation is the most appropriate next step to rule out hearing problems before considering other interventions like speech therapy.",9
9779,"The patient's symptoms and findings are suggestive of a systemic vasculitis. The key features include myalgias, chest pain, dizziness, fever, hypertension, skin changes (livedo reticularis and nodules with ulceration), elevated ESR, renal involvement, and characteristic angiographic findings of the renal arteries. These findings are consistent with polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), a medium-vessel vasculitis. PAN is characterized by transmural inflammation of the arterial wall with fibrinoid necrosis, which can lead to aneurysms and stenosis, as seen in the renal MR angiography. PAN does not typically involve the lungs, so pulmonary artery microaneurysms are unlikely. Anti-myeloperoxidase antibodies are associated with microscopic polyangiitis, not PAN. The presence of multinuclear giant cells with elastic membrane fragmentation is more characteristic of giant cell arteritis, which affects large vessels. Therefore, the most likely finding on further evaluation of this patient is transmural inflammation with fibrinoid necrosis on arterial biopsy, consistent with PAN.",9
9756,,0
9786,"The patient's symptoms and high hemoglobin A1c suggest poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. The physical examination findings of decreased vibratory sense and proprioception indicate possible diabetic neuropathy. The key part of the question is the response of pancreatic islet cells producing increasing amounts of secretory granules, which suggests stimulation of insulin secretion. Among the options, sulfonylureas like Glimepiride stimulate the pancreatic beta cells to increase insulin secretion by closing ATP-sensitive potassium channels, leading to depolarization and increased calcium influx, which results in the release of insulin granules. Metformin and pioglitazone do not directly stimulate insulin secretion, and acarbose works by inhibiting intestinal alpha-glucosidases. Therefore, the drug that causes increased insulin secretion from pancreatic islet cells is Glimepiride.",9
9788,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest a case of diphtheria, caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The sore throat, fever, and dark inflammatory exudate are characteristic of this infection. The culture on cysteine-tellurite agar producing black colonies is indicative of C. diphtheriae, as this organism reduces tellurite to tellurium, resulting in black colonies. Microscopically, C. diphtheriae is known for having metachromatic granules, which are intracellular inclusions that can be visualized with special stains such as methylene blue. These granules are a distinctive feature of the organism.",9
9787,"The infant presents with a loud holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border, which is characteristic of a ventricular septal defect (VSD). VSDs are the most common congenital heart defects and often present with a holosystolic murmur due to the left-to-right shunt of blood from the left ventricle to the right ventricle. The fact that the pediatrician reassures the parents that the defect will be monitored and likely won't require surgical intervention suggests that the defect is small. Small VSDs often close spontaneously and do not require surgery. An atrial septal defect (ASD) typically presents with a systolic ejection murmur and a fixed split S2, not a holosystolic murmur. Tetralogy of Fallot presents with a harsh systolic ejection murmur due to right ventricular outflow obstruction and is more severe, often requiring surgical intervention. Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) presents with a continuous ""machinery"" murmur, not a holosystolic murmur.",9
9794,"The patient has elevated LDL cholesterol (160 mg/dL) and total cholesterol (249 mg/dL), which indicates hyperlipidemia. Given his history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and chronic kidney disease, he is at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. The primary goal in managing hyperlipidemia in such patients is to lower LDL cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular risk. Statins are the first-line treatment for lowering LDL cholesterol and reducing cardiovascular risk. Simvastatin, a statin, is appropriate for this purpose. Ezetimibe is used as an adjunct to statins if further LDL reduction is needed. Fenofibrate is primarily used for hypertriglyceridemia, which is not the main issue here. Fish oil is also used for hypertriglyceridemia. Therefore, simvastatin is the most appropriate choice.",9
9795,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a bacterial pharyngitis, likely streptococcal, given the sore throat, fever, and purulent tonsillar exudate. The absence of cough and rhinorrhea also supports this. However, before prescribing antibiotics, it is important to confirm the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis. The rapid antigen detection test (RADT) is a quick and effective way to confirm the presence of Group A Streptococcus. Therefore, the best next step is to perform the RADT to confirm the diagnosis before starting antibiotic treatment.",9
9797,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs consistent with malignant otitis externa, a severe infection of the external auditory canal that can extend to the skull base. This condition is most commonly caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, especially in elderly patients with diabetes. The presence of granulation tissue in the ear canal and the CT findings of soft tissue thickening and mastoid destruction support this diagnosis. The most appropriate treatment for malignant otitis externa is an antipseudomonal antibiotic. Intravenous ciprofloxacin is effective against Pseudomonas and is the treatment of choice for this condition.",9
9798,"The patient presents with symptoms of heart failure exacerbation, including shortness of breath and bilateral lower extremity edema. The urinalysis shows >100,000 cfu/mL of E. coli, indicating a urinary tract infection (UTI). However, the patient is asymptomatic for UTI, as she denies any urinary symptoms. In elderly patients, asymptomatic bacteriuria is common and does not require treatment unless the patient is pregnant or undergoing urologic procedures. Therefore, the most appropriate management for this finding is to not treat the asymptomatic bacteriuria.",9
9801,"The patient's symptoms and recent travel history suggest an infection with a virus that causes hemorrhagic fever. The laboratory findings indicate a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with filamentous morphology. This description is characteristic of the Filoviridae family, which includes Ebola and Marburg viruses. Given the travel history to Liberia and the symptoms, Ebola virus is highly suspected. Marburg virus is closely related to Ebola virus, both being filoviruses. Dengue virus is a positive-sense RNA virus and belongs to the Flaviviridae family. Lassa fever virus is an arenavirus, and Hantavirus is a bunyavirus. Therefore, the pathogen responsible for this patient's symptoms is most similar to Marburg virus.",9
9803,"The clinical presentation suggests a mediastinal mass in a young child, which is likely a neuroblastoma given the age and symptoms. Neuroblastoma is a common tumor in children that can present with respiratory symptoms due to mass effect, as well as systemic symptoms like weight loss and fever. The periorbital ecchymosis (raccoon eyes) and proptosis are also indicative of neuroblastoma, which can metastasize to the orbits. Neuroblastoma is often associated with amplification of the N-myc oncogene, which is a poor prognostic factor. The other options do not fit as well: increased lymphoblast count would suggest leukemia, unregulated B-cell proliferation would suggest lymphoma, and acid-fast bacteria would suggest tuberculosis, none of which match the presentation as closely as neuroblastoma.",9
9805,"The patient's symptoms and test results are suggestive of carcinoid syndrome, which is caused by a neuroendocrine tumor that secretes serotonin and other vasoactive substances. The flushing, diarrhea, and wheezing, along with elevated 5-HIAA in the urine, support this diagnosis. The CT scan showing liver nodules suggests metastasis, which is common in carcinoid syndrome as the liver is a frequent site of metastasis. Octreotide, a somatostatin analog, is effective in controlling the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome by inhibiting the release of serotonin and other substances from the tumor. Therefore, the next best step in management is to start the patient on octreotide.",9
9806,"The patient underwent bilateral adrenalectomy, which would lead to a loss of adrenal hormones, including cortisol. This would result in a lack of negative feedback on the pituitary gland, causing increased production of ACTH. The increased ACTH can lead to hyperpigmentation due to its melanocyte-stimulating effects, explaining the darkening of her knuckles and skin creases. Additionally, the patient is experiencing visual disturbances, such as bumping into people and objects, which suggests a possible pituitary adenoma causing bitemporal hemianopsia due to compression of the optic chiasm. This adenoma could be secreting excess ACTH due to the lack of feedback inhibition from cortisol, which is consistent with the loss of a regulatory process. Therefore, the mechanism most likely accounting for her symptoms is the loss of the regulatory feedback process after adrenalectomy.",9
9812,"The patient's presentation of sudden onset severe vomiting without diarrhea shortly after attending a party is suggestive of food poisoning, particularly one caused by a preformed toxin. The key detail here is the rapid onset of symptoms, which is characteristic of Staphylococcus aureus food poisoning. This type of food poisoning is commonly associated with foods that are handled and left at room temperature, allowing the bacteria to produce toxins. Egg salad is a classic example of such a food, as it can be left out at room temperature during events like parties, leading to the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and subsequent toxin production. The other options, such as fish, home-made ice cream, and refried rice, are associated with different types of foodborne illnesses that typically have different symptom profiles or incubation periods.",9
9809,"The patient's symptoms and history are suggestive of osteoarthritis, characterized by joint pain that worsens with activity and minimal morning stiffness. She has been using acetaminophen at the maximum recommended dose without significant relief. The next step in managing osteoarthritis pain, especially when acetaminophen is ineffective, is to try a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) like meloxicam. NSAIDs can provide better pain relief by reducing inflammation, which is a component of osteoarthritis pain. Oral corticosteroids like methylprednisolone are not typically used for osteoarthritis due to their side effect profile and limited efficacy in this condition. Glucosamine supplementation has mixed evidence and is not considered a primary treatment. Increasing acetaminophen beyond 4000 mg per day is not safe due to the risk of liver toxicity.",9
9741,"The researcher is investigating how mRNA codons translate into proteins by using sequences of nucleotides and observing the resulting amino acids. The observation that ACCACCACC and CACCACCAC result in different amino acids while CCACCACCA results in a string of prolines suggests that the third codon in each sequence is crucial for determining the amino acid. 

Each mRNA codon consists of three nucleotides and specifies a particular amino acid. The sequences provided are repetitive, with variations in the first nucleotide of each codon.

- ACCACCACC and CACCACCAC likely code for different amino acids because the first nucleotide of each codon changes in these sequences, affecting the amino acid specified by the codon. 
- CCACCACCA, however, results in a string of prolines, indicating that the codons in this sequence (CCC) consistently code for proline, as the variations do not change the amino acid sequence due to redundancy in the genetic code.

The redundancy means that multiple codons can code for the same amino acid. In particular, proline is encoded by the codons CCU, CCC, CCA, and CCG.

The Wobble hypothesis explains the flexibility in base pairing at the third position of the codon, allowing for some variation without altering the amino acid specified. This flexibility is why CCACCACCA continues to produce proline, as the variations in the third position still result in proline being encoded.

Therefore, the phenomenon described is best explained by the Wobble hypothesis, which accounts for the redundancy and flexibility in codon-anticodon pairing at the third base of the codon.",9
9814,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest reactivation of tuberculosis (TB), especially given his HIV-positive status and the fact that he is from Mexico, where TB is more prevalent. The symptoms of fever, productive cough with blood, back pain, and night sweats are classic for TB. In TB, the histological hallmark is the formation of caseating granulomas. These granulomas are characterized by epithelioid cells (a type of macrophage) surrounded by multinucleated giant cells and lymphocytes. This description matches option B.",9
9822,"The patient's symptoms and signs suggest a deficiency in vitamin A (retinol). The key findings include night blindness (difficulty seeing at night), dry skin, and Bitot's spots (triangular keratin plaques on the conjunctiva). These are classic signs of vitamin A deficiency. The recurrent infections could also be related to impaired immune function due to vitamin A deficiency. The low BMI and weight loss could be related to malabsorption or poor nutritional intake, which can lead to multiple deficiencies, but the specific ocular and skin findings point towards vitamin A deficiency.",9
9817,"The patient is a 30-year-old woman at 16 weeks' gestation presenting with vaginal bleeding and an open cervical os, indicating a miscarriage. The ultrasound shows no fetal cardiac activity, confirming fetal demise. Her laboratory findings show anemia (hemoglobin 9.6 g/dL) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count 140,000/mm3), which could suggest a bleeding disorder or an underlying condition. The recurrent joint pain and thrombocytopenia raise suspicion for an autoimmune condition, such as antiphospholipid syndrome, which can cause placental thrombosis leading to fetal demise. This is supported by the history of recurrent joint pain, which could be related to an autoimmune process. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the findings is placental thrombosis due to an underlying condition like antiphospholipid syndrome.",9
9824,"The patient was treated with antivenom, which is a foreign protein, and developed symptoms 6 days later, including fever, rash, and arthralgias. These symptoms are consistent with serum sickness, which is a type III hypersensitivity reaction. Type III hypersensitivity reactions are immune complex-mediated, where antigen-antibody complexes deposit in tissues, leading to complement activation and inflammation. The timing (several days after exposure) and the symptoms (rash, fever, arthralgias) align with this mechanism.",9
9834,"Specificity is calculated as the number of true negatives divided by the sum of true negatives and false positives. In this case, the true negatives are the patients without breast cancer who tested negative, which is 23. The false positives are the patients without breast cancer who tested positive, which is 5. Therefore, specificity = 23 / (23 + 5) = 23 / 28 = 0.8214 or 82.14%. The national average specificity is 74%. The team's specificity of 82.14% is higher than the national average by approximately 8%.",9
9831,"The patient presents with severe pain in the right arm, inability to move it, and inconsistent sensory findings. He reports no sensation to light touch but withdraws from a pin prick, indicating that sensation is intact. This inconsistency suggests a non-organic cause. Factitious disorder involves intentional production of symptoms for psychological reasons, while malingering involves producing symptoms for external incentives, such as financial gain or avoiding work. Given the context of financial stress and inability to work, malingering is more likely. Brachial neuritis and radial nerve palsy would not explain the sensory inconsistencies.",9
9835,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings are suggestive of Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), which is characterized by the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, acute renal failure, and thrombocytopenia. The history of bloody diarrhea followed by pallor, lethargy, and laboratory findings such as anemia with schistocytes, elevated LDH, thrombocytopenia, and renal impairment support this diagnosis. HUS is often associated with infection by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (such as E. coli O157:H7), which leads to endothelial damage and the formation of microthrombi in small vessels. This results in mechanical hemolysis (schistocytes), renal impairment, and thrombocytopenia due to platelet consumption. Therefore, the most likely mechanism of this patient's presentation is microthrombi formation.",9

9823,"The clinical presentation suggests bacterial meningitis, given the symptoms of fever, headache, altered mental status, and nuchal rigidity. The CSF culture reveals gram-positive diplococci, which is characteristic of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Streptococcus pneumoniae is known for its optochin sensitivity, which is a key laboratory test used to differentiate it from other alpha-hemolytic streptococci. The other options are not consistent with Streptococcus pneumoniae: 
- Culture on chocolate agar with factors V and X is characteristic of Haemophilus influenzae.
- K-capsule is associated with Klebsiella pneumoniae.
- Pyocyanin production is characteristic of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Therefore, the characteristic expected in the organism responsible for this patient's symptoms is optochin sensitivity.",9
9837,"The patient has a Pap smear showing a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). HSIL indicates a significant risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or 3, which are precursors to cervical cancer. The standard management for HSIL is to perform a colposcopy to further evaluate the cervix and obtain directed biopsies if necessary. This allows for a more accurate assessment of the cervical tissue and determination of the extent of any dysplasia. Endometrial sampling is not indicated as there is no evidence of endometrial pathology. Repeating cytology in 6 months is not appropriate for HSIL due to the high risk of progression. Loop electrosurgical excision (LEEP) is a treatment option but is not the initial step without colposcopic evaluation.",10
9838,"To calculate the volume of distribution (Vd), we use the formula: \( Vd = \frac{Dose}{Concentration} \). The dose administered is 150 mg, which is equivalent to 150,000 mcg. The concentration measured is 2.5 mcg/mL. To find Vd in liters, we need to convert the concentration to mcg/L: 2.5 mcg/mL is equivalent to 2500 mcg/L. 

Now, plug the values into the formula:
\( Vd = \frac{150,000 \text{ mcg}}{2500 \text{ mcg/L}} = 60 \text{ L} \).

Therefore, the volume of distribution is closest to 60 L.",10
9840,"The patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with adrenal insufficiency: abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis. These symptoms are occurring in the context of an infection (influenza), which can precipitate an adrenal crisis in someone with adrenal insufficiency.

The key detail in the history is the prolonged corticosteroid therapy for nephrotic syndrome. Long-term corticosteroid use can lead to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, resulting in secondary adrenal insufficiency. In this case, the adrenal glands are not able to produce adequate cortisol in response to stress (such as an infection) due to this suppression.

Option A (bilateral hemorrhagic necrosis of the adrenal glands) is associated with Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, typically due to meningococcemia, not influenza.

Option C (an extremely virulent form of Influenza) does not directly explain the adrenal insufficiency symptoms.

Option D (primary adrenal insufficiency) would not be expected in this scenario given the history of corticosteroid use, which points towards secondary adrenal insufficiency.

Therefore, the most likely predisposing cause of the patient's symptoms is iatrogenic suppression of the adrenal glands due to prolonged corticosteroid therapy.",9
9846,"The patient's symptoms and family history suggest a hereditary bleeding disorder. The persistent epistaxis and family history of bleeding tendencies point towards a coagulation factor deficiency. Factor IX deficiency, also known as Hemophilia B, is a hereditary bleeding disorder that fits the pattern described. The presence of a factor VIII inhibitor would typically present with acquired hemophilia, which is less common in children and usually not hereditary. Vitamin K deficiency is unlikely given the chronic nature and family history. Proteinuria is unrelated to bleeding disorders. Therefore, the most likely cause is Factor IX deficiency.",9
9847,"The patient's symptoms are suggestive of intermittent claudication, which is a common manifestation of peripheral artery disease (PAD). The pain in his legs that occurs with walking and is relieved by rest is characteristic of this condition. Given his risk factors, including a history of smoking, diabetes, and obesity, PAD is a likely diagnosis. The best initial test to confirm PAD is the ankle-brachial index (ABI), which is a non-invasive and cost-effective method to assess for peripheral artery disease. Arteriography is more invasive and typically reserved for cases where intervention is being considered. Aspirin and atorvastatin are treatments for PAD, but the question asks for the best next step in management, which is to confirm the diagnosis first.",9
9848,"The patient presents with black spots in her vision and difficulty adapting to changes in lighting, along with bilateral bull's eye macular lesions on examination. She has a history of rheumatoid arthritis and is taking chloroquine, which is known to cause retinopathy characterized by bull's eye maculopathy. Her vision is 20/20, which is consistent with early chloroquine retinopathy where visual acuity may still be preserved. Diabetic retinopathy typically presents with different findings such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages, or exudates, and not bull's eye lesions. Angle-closure glaucoma would present with acute symptoms like eye pain and vision loss, not gradual changes and bull's eye lesions. Age-related macular degeneration usually presents with drusen or geographic atrophy, not bull's eye lesions. The elevated GGT is likely related to alcohol use and not directly related to her visual symptoms.",9
9852,"The clinical features described in the question are characteristic of Turner syndrome, which is a condition caused by the complete or partial absence of one X chromosome in females (45,X karyotype). The features include short stature, low-set posterior hairline, webbed neck, widely spaced nipples, and shortened fourth metacarpals. Turner syndrome is associated with several complications, one of which is cardiovascular abnormalities. The most common cardiovascular complication in Turner syndrome is coarctation of the aorta, but aortic stenosis, particularly bicuspid aortic valve, is also a known risk. Intellectual disability is not typically associated with Turner syndrome, and the other options (acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lens dislocation) are not commonly linked to this condition. Therefore, the patient is at increased risk of developing aortic stenosis.",9
9864,"The patient has chronic abdominal pain with no identifiable medical cause despite extensive testing, including endoscopies, colonoscopy, and exploratory laparoscopy. Her symptoms are causing significant distress and impairment in her social and occupational functioning. She is also preoccupied with her health, particularly due to her mother's history of colon cancer. This presentation is consistent with somatic symptom disorder, where the patient experiences significant distress and impairment due to physical symptoms that cannot be fully explained by a medical condition. Hypochondriasis, now referred to as illness anxiety disorder, involves excessive worry about having a serious illness without significant somatic symptoms, which does not match this patient's presentation. Functional neurologic symptom disorder involves neurological symptoms incompatible with medical conditions. Factitious disorder involves intentional production of symptoms for psychological gain, which is not indicated here. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is somatic symptom disorder.",9
9867,"The patient presents with symptoms and history suggestive of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), including a persistent cough, worsening shortness of breath, and crackles on lung examination. IPF is characterized by progressive scarring of the lung tissue, leading to restrictive lung disease. On imaging, particularly high-resolution CT scans, IPF typically shows a pattern known as 'honeycombing,' which consists of cystic airspaces in the lung interstitium. This is a key radiological finding in IPF. The other options do not align with the expected findings in IPF: Cushing’s syndrome is unrelated, acute asbestos exposure would suggest asbestosis, and smoking cessation does not reverse IPF symptoms.",9
9868,"The patient's symptoms and findings suggest celiac disease. The key features include abdominal pain, bloating, loose bowel movements, and a pruritic rash. The rash described as tense, grouped subepidermal blisters is consistent with dermatitis herpetiformis, which is associated with celiac disease. The conjunctival pallor and inflammation of the corners of the mouth suggest possible nutritional deficiencies, such as iron deficiency anemia, which can occur in celiac disease due to malabsorption. The most specific test for celiac disease is the presence of IgA tissue transglutaminase antibodies.",9
9874,"The patient's symptoms include fatigue, decreased sexual desire, erectile dysfunction, gynecomastia, and nipple discharge. These symptoms suggest a hormonal imbalance, likely involving prolactin. The traumatic brain injury could have affected the pituitary gland, leading to hormonal changes. The presence of gynecomastia and nipple discharge (galactorrhea) suggests elevated prolactin levels. Normally, dopamine inhibits prolactin secretion. A decrease in dopamine would lead to increased prolactin levels, causing the symptoms observed. Therefore, decreased dopamine production is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition.",9
9875,"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with Graves' disease, which is an autoimmune hyperthyroid condition characterized by symptoms such as palpitations, anxiety, weight loss, and exophthalmos. The treatment options for Graves' disease include antithyroid medications (methimazole or propylthiouracil), beta-blockers (such as propranolol), and radioactive iodine therapy. Radioactive iodine is known to potentially worsen ophthalmopathy in Graves' disease due to an increase in thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins or inflammatory mediators. The patient's worsening ocular symptoms after treatment suggest that she likely received radioactive iodine, which is known to exacerbate eye symptoms in some patients with Graves' disease.",9

9882,"The clinical presentation of this 6-week-old girl is suggestive of a genetic syndrome. The key features include difficulty feeding, regurgitation, distinctive facial features (mandibular hypoplasia, broad nasal bridge, widely-spaced eyes, round face, down-slanting palpebral fissures), a single palmar crease, and a cardiac murmur. These features are characteristic of Cri-du-chat syndrome, which is caused by a microdeletion on chromosome 5p. The 'crying resembling a squeaky door' is a classic description of the cat-like cry associated with this syndrome. The other options do not match the clinical presentation as closely: X-linked gene mutations typically present differently, translocation at chromosome 21 is associated with Down syndrome, and maternal hypothyroidism would not cause these specific dysmorphic features.",9
9879,"The patient presents with neurological symptoms (tremor, decreased concentration, and loss of interest), liver dysfunction (elevated AST, jaundice), and low ceruloplasmin levels. These findings are suggestive of Wilson's disease, a disorder of copper metabolism leading to copper accumulation in the liver and brain. The presence of a flapping tremor and broad-based gait further supports this diagnosis. The appropriate treatment for Wilson's disease involves chelation therapy to remove excess copper. Penicillamine is a chelating agent used to treat Wilson's disease by promoting copper excretion. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is penicillamine.",9
9871,"The patient presents with macrocytic anemia, as indicated by the elevated MCV, low hemoglobin, and low hematocrit. The presence of hypersegmented neutrophils on the blood smear suggests megaloblastic anemia, commonly due to vitamin B12 deficiency or folate deficiency. The suspicion of an autoimmune condition with anti-intrinsic factor antibodies points towards pernicious anemia, which is a common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency due to impaired absorption.

In pernicious anemia, intrinsic factor, which is necessary for vitamin B12 absorption in the ileum, is deficient due to autoimmune destruction of gastric parietal cells or the presence of antibodies against intrinsic factor itself.

One of the classic additional findings in vitamin B12 deficiency is neurological manifestations, which can include peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, or subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. However, these options are not provided.

The question asks for an expected finding in the context of this autoimmune condition. Cheilosis (angular cheilitis) is associated with other nutritional deficiencies like riboflavin (vitamin B2) deficiency, not vitamin B12 deficiency. Abdominal colic is not typically associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. High serum TSH would indicate hypothyroidism, which can be associated with autoimmune conditions like Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and there is a known association between autoimmune thyroid disease and pernicious anemia.

Given this context, high serum TSH is the most likely expected finding, as it suggests the possible co-occurrence of another autoimmune condition (hypothyroidism) with pernicious anemia.",9
9887,"The patient is experiencing mild vaginal bleeding and suprapubic pain at 8 weeks of gestation. The ultrasound shows an intrauterine pregnancy with normal fetal cardiac activity, and the cervical os is closed. These findings are consistent with a threatened abortion, where there is vaginal bleeding but the pregnancy is still viable. In such cases, the most appropriate management is reassurance and follow-up, as the pregnancy is currently viable and there is no evidence of miscarriage. Other options like low-dose aspirin, progestin therapy, or complete bed rest are not indicated in this scenario as they have not been shown to improve outcomes in threatened abortion.",9
9889,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of infective endocarditis, likely involving the aortic valve, given his history of a bicuspid aortic valve and the presence of a diastolic murmur. The high-pitched, early diastolic, decrescendo murmur along with an S3 gallop and diffuse crackles suggest aortic regurgitation and possible heart failure. The presence of a bicuspid aortic valve increases the risk of endocarditis and aortic regurgitation. Given the severity of the symptoms and the likely diagnosis of infective endocarditis with significant valve dysfunction, surgical intervention is often required. Mechanical valve replacement (B) is typically preferred in younger patients due to its durability compared to porcine (bioprosthetic) valves, which are more suitable for older patients or those who cannot take long-term anticoagulation. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management, in addition to antibiotics, is mechanical valve replacement of the aortic valve.",9
9860,,0
9898,"The patient's symptoms of headache, palpitations, diarrhea, weight loss, tachycardia, warm moist skin, and hyperreflexia suggest hyperthyroidism. The presence of a sellar mass on MRI indicates a pituitary adenoma, likely a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma (thyrotropinoma), which causes secondary hyperthyroidism. TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) acts on the thyroid gland by binding to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) on the thyroid follicular cells, stimulating the production and release of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). Therefore, the underlying cause of this patient's condition involves the binding of TSH to G protein-coupled receptors.",9
9892,"The patient presents with sudden onset of severe abdominal pain, fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and signs of peritonitis (guarding, rebound tenderness, absent bowel sounds). These findings suggest an acute abdominal emergency. The leukocytosis and fever indicate an inflammatory or infectious process. The hypotension and tachycardia suggest possible septic shock or significant fluid loss. Given the acute presentation and peritoneal signs, a perforated viscus is highly likely. A perforation would lead to leakage of gastrointestinal contents into the peritoneal cavity, causing peritonitis and the systemic inflammatory response seen here. The patient's history of NSAID use (ibuprofen) increases the risk of peptic ulcer disease and subsequent perforation. Other options like ruptured ectopic pregnancy, bowel obstruction, and colorectal cancer are less consistent with the acute presentation and peritoneal signs.",9
9907,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of a molar pregnancy, specifically a complete hydatidiform mole. The key features include painless vaginal bleeding, uterine size larger than expected for gestational age, and the ultrasound finding of a ""bunch of grapes"" appearance with no fetus. In a complete mole, there is typically no fetal tissue, and the most common karyotype is 46, XX, which results from the fertilization of an empty egg by a single sperm that duplicates its genetic material. The karyotype 46, XY can also occur but is less common. The karyotype 46, YY is not viable, and 69, XXY is associated with a partial mole, which usually presents with some fetal tissue. Therefore, the most likely karyotype in this scenario is 46, XX.",9
9915,"The clinical presentation suggests a viral infection, particularly given the history of a rash on the upper lip two weeks ago, which is characteristic of herpes labialis (cold sores) caused by Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). The current painful lesion on the finger, along with the fever and lymphadenopathy, is consistent with herpetic whitlow, which is an HSV infection of the finger. This condition often occurs in children who suck their thumbs or fingers, transferring the virus from the mouth to the finger. The presence of tender lymphadenopathy further supports a viral infection. Sporothrix schenckii is associated with rose gardener's disease and typically presents with nodular lesions along lymphatic channels. Human papillomavirus type 1 causes warts, which are not typically painful or associated with fever. Trichophyton rubrum causes dermatophytosis, which is not consistent with the acute presentation described.",9
9920,"The patient's presentation is consistent with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), as indicated by the elevated serum calcitonin level and the thyroid nodule. MTC can be associated with flushing and diarrhea due to calcitonin and other peptide secretion. The presence of lung nodules suggests metastatic disease. Vandetanib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of advanced or metastatic MTC. Radioactive iodine is not effective for MTC, as it does not take up iodine. TSH suppression is used in differentiated thyroid cancers, not MTC. Tamoxifen is used for breast cancer, not thyroid cancer. Therefore, the appropriate treatment option for this patient is Vandetanib.",9
9906,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of meningitis, including fever, confusion, photophobia, and a recent history of sinusitis, which can be a source of bacterial spread to the meninges. The most common organisms causing bacterial meningitis in adults include Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. Empirical treatment for bacterial meningitis in adults typically includes ceftriaxone and vancomycin to cover these organisms. Ampicillin is added in patients over 50 or those who are immunocompromised to cover Listeria monocytogenes. Since the patient is 45 years old and there is no indication of immunocompromise, the most appropriate empirical treatment is ceftriaxone and vancomycin.",9
9923,"The patient's symptoms of numbness, tingling, and difficulty with balance, along with laboratory findings of anemia, elevated homocysteine and methylmalonic acid levels, and hypersegmented neutrophils, suggest vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to neurological symptoms and megaloblastic anemia. Elevated methylmalonic acid is specifically associated with vitamin B12 deficiency, as opposed to folate deficiency, which would not elevate methylmalonic acid. Therefore, cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) supplementation would have prevented this condition.",9
9927,"The clinical presentation of this 4-year-old boy is consistent with Kawasaki disease, which is characterized by prolonged fever, conjunctivitis, rash, cervical lymphadenopathy, changes in the lips and oral cavity (such as a strawberry tongue), and extremity changes (such as edema and erythema of the hands and feet). Kawasaki disease is a vasculitis that primarily affects children and can lead to coronary artery aneurysms if not treated appropriately. The laboratory findings of elevated ESR and CRP support the inflammatory nature of the disease. The most concerning complication of untreated Kawasaki disease is coronary artery involvement, which can lead to coronary artery ectasia or aneurysms. Therefore, the correct answer is coronary artery ectasia.",9
9929,"The patient presents with symptoms and examination findings suggestive of mitral stenosis, as indicated by the opening snap and diastolic decrescendo murmur at the apex. The mitral valve area of 2.2 cm² suggests mild mitral stenosis (severe stenosis is usually <1.5 cm²). The irregular heart rate suggests atrial fibrillation, which is common in mitral stenosis. In pregnant patients with atrial fibrillation, rate control is important to manage symptoms and prevent complications. Beta-blockers are often used for rate control in atrial fibrillation, especially in the setting of mitral stenosis, as they help control the heart rate and reduce symptoms like palpitations. Other options like balloon commissurotomy are not indicated for mild stenosis, and warfarin is generally avoided in pregnancy due to teratogenicity, especially in the first trimester. Antidiuretic therapy is not indicated at this moment as there are no signs of heart failure.",9
9930,"The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), characterized by a sudden, severe headache (often described as a ""thunderclap"" headache), neck pain, and vomiting. The history of a similar headache a week ago that resolved spontaneously could indicate a ""sentinel bleed,"" which is a warning leak before a major hemorrhage. In suspected cases of SAH, the first step is to perform a CT scan of the head without contrast to quickly identify any bleeding. If the CT scan is negative but suspicion remains high, a lumbar puncture may be performed to look for xanthochromia. However, the immediate next step is the CT scan without contrast to confirm the diagnosis of SAH.",9
9932,"The patient is presenting with respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and elevated beta-D-glucan, which are suggestive of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), especially given his low CD4 count and non-compliance with antiretroviral therapy. The elevated lactate dehydrogenase and the arterial blood gas showing respiratory alkalosis with hypoxemia further support this diagnosis. In cases of moderate to severe PCP, as indicated by a PaO2 < 70 mm Hg or an A-a gradient > 35 mm Hg, adjunctive corticosteroids such as prednisone are recommended to reduce inflammation and improve outcomes. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is the administration of prednisone.",9
9937,"The patient is a 75-year-old woman with episodic abdominal pain following meals, which has worsened recently. Her history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (HbA1C of 10%) suggests possible vascular complications. The postprandial nature of the pain suggests intestinal angina, which is characteristic of mesenteric ischemia. Mesenteric artery occlusion, often due to atherosclerosis, is common in patients with diabetes and can lead to chronic mesenteric ischemia, presenting as abdominal pain after eating. The other options are less likely: acute pancreatitis would present with more acute, severe pain and elevated pancreatic enzymes; hepatic infarction is rare and would likely present with liver function abnormalities; chronic renal failure would not typically present with postprandial abdominal pain.",9
9936,"The patient's arterial blood gas shows a low pH (acidosis), elevated pCO2 (hypercapnia), and low pO2 (hypoxemia). The elevated pCO2 and low pH suggest a respiratory acidosis, indicating hypoventilation. The hyperresonance to percussion and decreased breath sounds bilaterally suggest air trapping, which is consistent with hypoventilation. The alveolar-arterial gradient is calculated as the difference between the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen (70 mm Hg) and the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (63 mm Hg), which is 7 mm Hg. This normal A-a gradient suggests that the hypoxemia is due to hypoventilation rather than a diffusion defect, shunt, or V/Q mismatch. Therefore, the most likely etiology of the patient's symptoms is alveolar hypoventilation.",9
9939,"The patient initially had acute otitis media and was treated with amoxicillin. After completing the antibiotic course, she is asymptomatic except for mild fullness in the ear. The otoscopic findings of an air-fluid level and decreased mobility of the tympanic membrane suggest the presence of otitis media with effusion (OME), which is common after an episode of acute otitis media. OME often resolves spontaneously without the need for additional antibiotics or steroids. Therefore, the best management approach is observation and regular follow-up to ensure resolution.",9
9942,"The patient's symptoms and colonoscopy findings are consistent with ulcerative colitis, which is characterized by inflammation starting in the rectum and extending proximally in a continuous manner. The presence of pseudopolyps and the extent of the disease up to the splenic flexure further support this diagnosis. While medications like sulfasalazine, corticosteroids, and azathioprine are used to manage symptoms and induce remission, the only definitive treatment that cures ulcerative colitis is surgical removal of the colon and rectum, known as total proctocolectomy.",9
9943,"The presentation of erythematous plaques with shiny, yellow scales over the scalp and external ears in a 5-month-old boy is characteristic of infantile seborrheic dermatitis, commonly known as cradle cap. This condition is common in infants and typically presents with these types of lesions. The complete blood count is normal, which does not suggest any systemic illness. Langerhans cell histiocytosis could present with a rash but is usually associated with other systemic symptoms and abnormal blood counts. Pityriasis amiantacea is a condition that affects older children and adults, characterized by thick scales on the scalp, and is less common in infants. Atopic dermatitis typically presents with dry, itchy skin and is less likely to have the shiny, yellow scales described here. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is infantile seborrheic dermatitis.",9
9946,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with anticholinergic toxicity, likely due to diphenhydramine, which is an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties. The symptoms include confusion, dry skin, flushed appearance, tachycardia, and fever. These are classic signs of anticholinergic syndrome. The best treatment for anticholinergic toxicity is physostigmine, which is a cholinesterase inhibitor that can cross the blood-brain barrier and counteract the central and peripheral effects of anticholinergic agents.",9
9945,"The clinical presentation of this patient suggests Turner syndrome, characterized by short stature, broad chest with widely spaced nipples, and a short fourth metacarpal. The hypertension and mild hearing loss also fit the profile. Turner syndrome is often associated with cardiovascular anomalies, the most common being coarctation of the aorta. Coarctation of the aorta typically presents with a continuous, flow murmur best heard in the interscapular region due to collateral circulation. Therefore, the most likely finding on physical exam in this patient would be a continuous, flow murmur best heard in the interscapular region.",9
9944,"Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive disorder. For a child to be affected, they must inherit two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent. The fact that two of her siblings have died from Tay-Sachs disease indicates that both parents are carriers (heterozygous for the mutation). 

For each child of two carrier parents, the probabilities are:
- 25% chance of being affected (homozygous recessive)
- 50% chance of being a carrier (heterozygous)
- 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier (homozygous dominant)

Since the woman is phenotypically normal, she is not affected by Tay-Sachs disease, which rules out the 25% chance of being homozygous recessive. Therefore, she has a 50% chance of being a carrier out of the remaining 75% chance of being either a carrier or homozygous dominant. 

Thus, the probability of her being a carrier is 50% / (50% + 25%) = 50% / 75% = 2/3 or approximately 66%.",9
9947,"The clinical presentation of the patient suggests a condition associated with connective tissue abnormalities and a metabolic disorder. The key findings include sudden onset of neurological symptoms (right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking), lens dislocation, and a marfanoid habitus (thin, long arms and slender fingers). These features are characteristic of homocystinuria, a disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme cystathionine synthase. Homocystinuria leads to elevated levels of homocysteine in the blood and urine, which aligns with the laboratory findings of increased concentrations of a metabolic intermediate. The other enzyme deficiencies listed do not match the clinical presentation as closely as cystathionine synthase deficiency does. Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency leads to phenylketonuria, homogentisate oxidase deficiency leads to alkaptonuria, and branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase deficiency leads to maple syrup urine disease, none of which fit the described symptoms.",9
9953,"The child has developed a pruritic rash with maculopapular and pustular lesions 18 days after receiving routine immunizations. Given the timing and the nature of the rash, this is most consistent with a mild case of varicella (chickenpox) due to the replication of the attenuated varicella-zoster virus from the vaccine. This is a known, albeit rare, side effect of the live attenuated varicella vaccine, which can cause a mild form of the disease as the virus replicates. The other options do not fit the scenario: 

- Option A (Antigen contact with presensitized T-lymphocytes) describes a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, which is not consistent with the presentation.
- Option B (Reactivation of virus dormant in dorsal root ganglion) describes herpes zoster (shingles), which is unlikely in a 13-month-old.
- Option C (Crosslinking of preformed IgE antibodies) describes an immediate hypersensitivity reaction, such as an allergic reaction, which does not match the clinical picture.

Therefore, the most likely explanation is replication of the attenuated vaccine strain.",9
9950,"The clinical presentation suggests a case of COPD exacerbation, likely due to an infection, given the fever and productive cough. The patient's history of smoking and previous hospitalizations for similar symptoms supports this. The disorientation and inability to complete sentences indicate possible hypercapnia or hypoxemia, common in COPD exacerbations. The chest X-ray would likely show hyperinflation or other signs consistent with COPD. In COPD, especially with right heart strain or cor pulmonale, ECG changes can include P pulmonale, which is characterized by increased P wave amplitude due to right atrial enlargement.",9
9956,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs consistent with heat stroke, including hyperthermia (temperature of 41°C), altered mental status, hypotension, and dark brown urine suggestive of rhabdomyolysis (elevated creatine kinase). Immediate cooling is critical in managing heat stroke to prevent further complications. Ice water immersion is the most effective method for rapidly reducing core body temperature in cases of exertional heat stroke, which is likely given the patient's collapse in a hot environment. Evaporative cooling is another method but is generally less effective than ice water immersion for rapid cooling. Platelet transfusion is not indicated as the thrombocytopenia is likely secondary to heat stroke and should resolve with treatment. A CT scan of the head is not immediately necessary as the primary issue is hyperthermia, not a neurological event.",9

9958,"The patient exhibits symptoms of psychosis, including auditory hallucinations and delusions, such as hearing voices and believing in a plot to kill him. These symptoms have been present for 8 months. Schizophreniform disorder is characterized by symptoms of schizophrenia that last more than 1 month but less than 6 months. Schizophrenia requires symptoms to be present for at least 6 months. Substance-induced psychosis is unlikely given the negative urine toxicology. Brief psychotic disorder lasts less than 1 month. Given the duration of 8 months, the most appropriate diagnosis is schizophrenia.",9
9960,"The clinical presentation of the child includes growth retardation (height and weight below the 5th percentile), protuberant abdomen, hepatomegaly, skin changes (hyper- and hypopigmentation, desquamation), and pitting edema. These symptoms are indicative of kwashiorkor, which is caused by severe protein malnutrition. Kwashiorkor is characterized by edema, an enlarged liver due to fatty infiltration, skin changes, and a protuberant abdomen. The presence of pitting edema and skin changes, along with the child's background of recent immigration from Africa, supports the diagnosis of kwashiorkor rather than marasmus, which is associated with total caloric deprivation and does not typically present with edema. Hypothyroidism and vitamin A deficiency do not account for the full range of symptoms observed in this child.",9
9965,"The patient has hypertension, diabetic nephropathy (indicated by elevated serum creatinine and fundoscopic findings), and edema. In patients with diabetes and hypertension, especially with evidence of nephropathy, an ACE inhibitor like perindopril is preferred. ACE inhibitors help reduce blood pressure and provide renal protection by reducing intraglomerular pressure and slowing the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic that could help with edema but is not the best choice for renal protection. Metoprolol, a beta-blocker, is not first-line for diabetic nephropathy. Diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, does not provide the renal protective effects of an ACE inhibitor. Therefore, the best initial therapy is an ACE inhibitor.",9
9957,"The patient's symptoms include tingling and numbness in the right hand, specifically affecting the little finger and the medial aspect of the hand. This distribution of sensory loss suggests involvement of the ulnar nerve. The ulnar nerve provides sensation to the little finger and the medial half of the ring finger, as well as the medial aspect of the hand. The decreased pinch strength also suggests ulnar nerve involvement, as it innervates muscles responsible for fine motor control in the hand.

The most common sites of ulnar nerve compression are the cubital tunnel at the elbow and the Guyon canal at the wrist. Given the sensory distribution and the fact that the symptoms are worse in the evening, it is more likely that the compression is occurring at the cubital tunnel, where the ulnar nerve passes behind the medial epicondyle of the humerus. This is a common site of compression for individuals who frequently flex their elbows, such as carpenters.

Compression at the Guyon canal would typically affect the ulnar nerve more distally, potentially sparing some of the dorsal sensory branches, which does not align with the patient's symptoms. Therefore, the most likely site of nerve compression is the cubital tunnel.",9
9969,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are suggestive of a pulmonary process. The key findings include dullness to percussion, increased tactile fremitus, bronchial breath sounds, and whispered pectoriloquy in the right lower lung field. These findings are characteristic of lung consolidation, which occurs when the alveoli are filled with fluid or solid material, such as in pneumonia. The dullness to percussion indicates a denser area in the lung, and increased tactile fremitus suggests that sound is being conducted more efficiently through a consolidated lung. Bronchial breath sounds and whispered pectoriloquy are also indicative of consolidation, as they occur when the normal air-filled lung is replaced by fluid or solid material, allowing for better transmission of sound. These findings are not consistent with pleural effusion (which would cause decreased fremitus and breath sounds), ruptured pulmonary blebs (which would cause pneumothorax), or pulmonary infarction (which might not cause these specific auscultatory findings). Therefore, the most likely cause of these findings is parenchymal consolidation, such as from pneumonia.",9
9971,"In a stressful situation, the body releases stress hormones such as epinephrine and cortisol. These hormones activate pathways that increase blood glucose levels to provide energy for the 'fight or flight' response. Epinephrine and glucagon activate glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, while inhibiting glycolysis in the liver. Phosphofructokinase (PFK) is a key regulatory enzyme in glycolysis, and it is inhibited by high levels of ATP and citrate, which are indicative of high energy states. During stress, the body prioritizes glucose production and release into the bloodstream rather than its utilization in glycolysis. Therefore, PFK is inhibited to reduce glycolysis and favor glucose availability. The other enzymes listed are involved in gluconeogenesis or glycogenolysis, which are processes activated during stress to increase blood glucose levels.",9
9977,"The patient was started on sertraline, an SSRI, for symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder. After 4 weeks, he reports slight improvement but not complete resolution of symptoms. SSRIs can take 4-6 weeks to show full efficacy. Since the patient is showing some improvement, it is reasonable to continue the current treatment for a longer period before making changes. Switching to a different SSRI or adding another medication is typically considered if there is no improvement or if side effects are intolerable. Therefore, the best next step is to continue sertraline and reassess later.",9
9973,"The patient's symptoms and social history suggest a sexually transmitted infection, likely gonorrhea or chlamydia. Ceftriaxone is used to treat gonorrhea. However, due to the high rate of co-infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, it is standard practice to also treat for chlamydia. Doxycycline is commonly used for chlamydia infections. Therefore, after administering ceftriaxone for gonorrhea, doxycycline would be prescribed to cover chlamydia.",9
9979,"The patient presents with chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia (pain during intercourse), and new onset yellowish vaginal discharge. She also has a fever of 39.1°C (102.3°F). The bimanual exam reveals a tender adnexa and uterus with cervical motion tenderness. These findings are highly suggestive of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which is an infection of the upper genital tract, often caused by sexually transmitted infections. The negative whiff test and vaginal pH greater than 4.5 help rule out bacterial vaginosis. The presence of cervical motion tenderness, adnexal tenderness, and fever are classic signs of PID. Ectopic pregnancy is less likely given the presentation and lack of positive pregnancy test or acute abdominal pain. Urinary tract infection typically presents with dysuria and urinary symptoms, which are not mentioned here. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is pelvic inflammatory disease.",9
9983,"The patient has experienced a thrombotic stroke, which leads to ischemia in the affected area of the brain. In the central nervous system, ischemic injury typically results in liquefactive necrosis. This is due to the high lipid content and the presence of enzymes that digest the tissue, leading to a transformation into a liquid viscous mass. The CT scan showing hypoattenuation in the left middle cerebral artery territory is consistent with this type of necrosis, as the tissue becomes less dense due to the liquefaction process.",9
9987,"The patient is a young, healthy individual experiencing intermittent palpitations, likely due to stress and lack of sleep from studying for exams. Her vital signs are stable, and she appears anxious but otherwise normal. The ECG is not described, but given the context, it is likely not showing any acute abnormalities. In such cases, where the palpitations are brief and the patient is stable, the most appropriate management is conservative. Observation and rest are recommended to see if the symptoms resolve with lifestyle modifications, such as reducing stress and ensuring adequate sleep. Echocardiography, electrical cardioversion, and pharmacologic cardioversion are not indicated at this time given the stability and likely benign nature of the symptoms.",9
9991,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of nephrotic syndrome, characterized by edema, hypoalbuminemia, and significant proteinuria. Given her history of HIV infection, the most likely cause of nephrotic syndrome in this context is HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). HIVAN is typically associated with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), which is characterized by segmental scarring of the glomeruli. This is consistent with the patient's presentation and the demographic risk factors, as African Americans are more predisposed to developing FSGS in the context of HIV infection.",9
9989,"The patient's symptoms include progressive difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), hoarseness, drooling, tongue atrophy, muscle atrophy, and hyperreflexia (3+ deep tendon reflexes). These findings suggest involvement of both upper and lower motor neurons. The intact sensation rules out peripheral neuropathy, and the normal esophagogastroduodenoscopy suggests the issue is not structural in the esophagus. Multiple cerebral infarctions would not typically cause lower motor neuron signs like muscle atrophy and tongue atrophy. Autoimmune destruction of acetylcholine receptors, as seen in myasthenia gravis, would not cause muscle atrophy or hyperreflexia. Demyelination of peripheral nerves, as seen in conditions like Guillain-Barré syndrome, would cause sensory deficits and areflexia, not hyperreflexia. The combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs is characteristic of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which involves destruction of both upper and lower motor neurons.",9
9986,"To compare the differences in outcomes between a group receiving a new treatment and a group not receiving the treatment, a study design that allows for direct comparison between two groups is needed. A clinical treatment trial, also known as a randomized controlled trial (RCT), is the most appropriate design for this purpose. In an RCT, participants are randomly assigned to either the treatment group or the control group, allowing for a controlled comparison of outcomes. This design minimizes bias and confounding factors, providing robust evidence of the treatment's efficacy. 

A case-control study is retrospective and compares patients with a condition to those without, looking back at exposures, which is not suitable for testing a new treatment. A historical cohort study uses past records to follow groups over time, which is not ideal for testing new interventions. A cohort study follows groups over time but lacks the randomization of an RCT, making it less ideal for directly comparing treatment effects.",9
9992,"The patient has a history of head trauma with a lucid interval followed by a rapid decline in consciousness, which is characteristic of an epidural hematoma. The anisocoria and signs of increased intracranial pressure (such as bradycardia and hypertension) suggest significant mass effect and possible brain herniation. The CT scan would likely show a biconvex, hyperdense lesion indicative of an epidural hematoma. The most effective treatment for an epidural hematoma with significant mass effect is surgical evacuation to relieve the pressure and prevent further brain damage.",9
9995,"The scenario describes a patient who has undergone a kidney transplant and is experiencing symptoms shortly after the procedure. The key details include lower abdominal pain, tenderness, diffuse tissue edema on ultrasound, and an increase in serum creatinine, leading to dialysis. These findings suggest a hyperacute rejection, which occurs within minutes to hours after transplantation. Hyperacute rejection is typically caused by preformed antibodies in the recipient against donor antigens, specifically class I HLA molecules. This leads to immediate vascular injury and graft failure. The other options describe mechanisms of rejection that occur later: proliferation of donor T lymphocytes (graft-versus-host disease), irreversible intimal fibrosis (chronic rejection), and immune complex deposition (acute or chronic rejection).",9
9998,"The patient is dealing with a stressful and emotional situation by focusing on intellectual aspects rather than addressing his emotions directly. He is using knowledge and facts about human emotion and neurological effects to rationalize his wife's behavior, which is characteristic of intellectualization. This defense mechanism involves using logic and reasoning to avoid confronting emotional stress.",9
9994,"The patient's symptoms are indicative of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), characterized by intrusive thoughts about harming his girlfriend and compulsive behaviors such as repeating prayers to alleviate anxiety. The fact that he recognizes the voice as his own and feels compelled to perform rituals to prevent harm suggests OCD rather than a primary psychotic disorder. Clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant with strong serotonergic properties, is particularly effective for OCD. The patient's lack of response to fluoxetine, an SSRI, suggests that a more potent serotonergic agent like clomipramine might be beneficial. Alprazolam and buspirone are not first-line treatments for OCD, and amitriptyline is not specifically effective for OCD.",9
9997,"To determine cardiac output, we need to calculate the stroke volume first and then multiply it by the heart rate. Stroke volume (SV) is calculated as the difference between end diastolic volume (EDV) and end systolic volume (ESV). In this case, SV = 160 mL - 100 mL = 60 mL. Cardiac output (CO) is then calculated by multiplying the stroke volume by the heart rate (HR). The heart rate is given as 115 beats per minute. Therefore, CO = SV * HR = 60 mL * 115/min = 6900 mL/min or 6.9 L/min. The correct formula for cardiac output in this context is (160 - 100) * 115.",10
9970,"In a sleeve gastrectomy, a large portion of the stomach along the greater curvature is removed. The arterial supply to this region primarily involves the right and left gastroepiploic arteries. The left gastroepiploic artery, which supplies the greater curvature, is a branch of the splenic artery. Therefore, to complete the resection, the left gastroepiploic artery will likely need to be ligated. Thus, the vessel that gives rise to the left gastroepiploic artery is the splenic artery.",9
10003,"The patient has pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as indicated by the blue-green pigment and grape-like odor. Piperacillin is an antipseudomonal penicillin often used in combination with tazobactam, a beta-lactamase inhibitor. The second agent is likely tazobactam, which works by inhibiting beta-lactamase enzymes produced by bacteria, thereby preventing the degradation of piperacillin. This allows piperacillin to remain effective against the bacteria. Therefore, the mechanism of action of the second agent is to impair bacterial degradation of piperacillin.",9
10004,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction (MI), including chest pain radiating to the left arm and a history of risk factors such as atrial fibrillation and diabetes. In the context of an MI, biochemical markers are used to confirm the diagnosis. 

- Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is primarily a liver enzyme and not specific for cardiac events.
- Creatinine-kinase MB (CK-MB) is a cardiac marker that rises within 4-6 hours, peaks at 12-24 hours, and returns to baseline within 48-72 hours.
- Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a less specific marker that can be elevated in various conditions, including MI, but it is not the most specific or commonly used marker.
- Troponin I is a highly specific marker for cardiac injury. It rises within 4-6 hours, peaks at 10-24 hours, and remains elevated for 7-10 days, making it the most appropriate marker for detecting an MI and monitoring it over a week.

Given the need for a marker that remains elevated for a week, Troponin I is the most likely to be elevated and remain elevated for that duration after an acute MI.",9
1815,"The patient is 18 years old, which means he is legally an adult and can make his own medical decisions. He has been informed about the diagnosis, the nature of the procedure, and the potential risks and benefits. Despite his parents' objections, he has the right to consent to the procedure himself. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to respect his autonomy and perform the excision if he consents to it.",9
10007,"The patient presents with symptoms of urinary incontinence upon exertion, coughing, and laughing, which are characteristic of stress urinary incontinence. This condition is often associated with pelvic floor weakness, which can lead to pelvic organ prolapse. Given her obstetric history (G5P3), she is at increased risk for pelvic floor disorders. A cystocele, which is a protrusion of the bladder into the anterior wall of the vagina, is a common finding in women with stress urinary incontinence. The absence of urgency, nocturia, or painful urination further supports stress incontinence rather than other types of incontinence like urge incontinence. The other options (rectocele, ovarian mass, purulent cervical discharge) are less likely to be directly related to her symptoms of stress incontinence.",9
1823,"The patient is experiencing stable angina, characterized by chest pain with exertion that resolves with rest. He is already on aspirin, which is appropriate for secondary prevention. The goal is to reduce anginal episodes and improve exercise tolerance. Beta-blockers, such as metoprolol, are first-line for stable angina as they reduce heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand. A statin is indicated for cardiovascular risk reduction. Sublingual nitroglycerin is used for immediate relief of angina. Therefore, the best regimen includes a beta-blocker, a statin, and sublingual nitroglycerin as needed.",9
10011,"The scenario describes a man who, after being passed up for a promotion, begins to imitate his coworker who received the promotion. This includes adopting his coworker's style, phrases, and even purchasing a similar car. This behavior is indicative of introjection, a defense mechanism where an individual unconsciously adopts the characteristics or traits of another person. In this case, the patient is internalizing aspects of his coworker, likely as a way to cope with the feelings of inadequacy or loss associated with not receiving the promotion. The other options do not fit as well: sublimation involves channeling unacceptable impulses into socially acceptable actions, conversion involves physical symptoms with no medical cause, and regression involves reverting to an earlier stage of development.",9
10013,"The patient is 15 weeks pregnant and presents with lower abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. On examination, the cervical os is closed, and there is no fetal tissue passed. An ultrasound shows a viable fetus with a normal heart rate. These findings are consistent with a threatened abortion, where there is vaginal bleeding before 20 weeks of gestation, but the cervix remains closed and the fetus is still viable. Incomplete abortion would involve an open cervix and passage of some fetal tissue. Inevitable abortion would involve an open cervix with bleeding and cramping, indicating that miscarriage is unavoidable. Complete abortion would involve the passage of all fetal tissue with a closed cervix afterward. Therefore, the correct diagnosis is threatened abortion.",9
10016,"The patient is a 36-year-old woman with a history of delivering large babies (macrosomia) and has a high BMI, indicating obesity. These factors increase her risk for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Given her age, obesity, and history of macrosomia, she should be screened for GDM early in pregnancy. The glucose oral tolerance test is the appropriate screening test for GDM.",9
10028,"Study A is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) where participants are randomly assigned to either a low-salt diet or a control group. This randomization helps to evenly distribute confounding variables between the groups, allowing for better control of confounding variables. Study B, on the other hand, is an observational study where dietary sodium intake is estimated without random assignment, which does not control for confounding variables as effectively as randomization does.

A chi-square test is typically used for categorical data to assess the association between two categorical variables, such as the presence or absence of atrial fibrillation in Study B. A t-test is used to compare means between two groups, which is not applicable to Study A as it involves categorical outcomes (presence or absence of atrial fibrillation) rather than continuous data.

Therefore, the statement that Study A allows for better control of confounding variables is true.",9
10020,"The patient presents with symptoms of fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and a rash after returning from Brazil, where he engaged in outdoor water activities. These symptoms, combined with the recent travel history, suggest a parasitic infection related to freshwater exposure. Schistosomiasis is a common parasitic disease associated with freshwater activities, caused by Schistosoma species. Schistosoma mansoni is prevalent in Brazil and is known to cause symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and a rash (often referred to as ""swimmer's itch"" or cercarial dermatitis). Schistosoma japonicum is more common in East Asia, not South America. Onchocerca volvulus is associated with river blindness and is not related to these symptoms or geographic location. Vibrio cholerae causes severe watery diarrhea but is not associated with a rash or the specific travel history. Therefore, the most likely organism responsible for this patient's condition is Schistosoma mansoni.",9
10029,"The patient presents with fever, chills, altered mental status, hypotension, and signs of infection, suggesting sepsis. The laboratory findings show thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), prolonged prothrombin time (PT), and prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT), which are indicative of a coagulopathy. The presence of ecchymoses and these lab findings suggest a bleeding disorder.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is characterized by widespread activation of the clotting cascade, leading to consumption of clotting factors and platelets, resulting in bleeding and ecchymoses. DIC is often associated with sepsis, which fits the clinical picture here.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) typically presents with thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, renal dysfunction, neurological symptoms, and fever, but does not usually cause prolonged PT and PTT.

Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) causes isolated thrombocytopenia without affecting PT and PTT.

An adverse effect of warfarin would cause prolonged PT, but not typically prolonged PTT, and the patient is already on warfarin, making this less likely.

Given the clinical context of sepsis and the lab findings, DIC is the most likely cause of the ecchymoses.",9
10032,"The patient's symptoms are characteristic of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), which includes an unpleasant sensation in the legs, an urge to move them, and symptoms that worsen at night. Her microcytic anemia suggests iron deficiency, which is a known risk factor for RLS. While correcting the anemia is important, pharmacological treatment for RLS often involves dopamine agonists. Ropinirole is a dopamine agonist that is commonly used to treat RLS. Haloperidol and lithium are not used for RLS and could potentially worsen symptoms. Propranolol is a beta-blocker and is not indicated for RLS treatment.",9
10035,"The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest a bleeding disorder. The prolonged bleeding time and prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) with normal prothrombin time (PT) are indicative of a defect in the intrinsic coagulation pathway. The symptoms of nosebleeds and prolonged bleeding after minor cuts are consistent with von Willebrand disease (vWD), which involves a defect in von Willebrand factor (vWF). vWF is responsible for binding to subendothelial collagen and facilitating platelet adhesion, which explains the prolonged bleeding time. The prolonged PTT occurs because vWF also stabilizes factor VIII, which is part of the intrinsic pathway. Therefore, the function of the defective component in this case is to bind to subendothelial collagen.",9
10036,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with Alzheimer's disease, characterized by progressive memory loss and disorientation. She has mild memory impairment and is oriented to self and place but not to time. The presence of urinary incontinence could suggest normal pressure hydrocephalus, but the normal gait and lack of other neurological abnormalities make Alzheimer's more likely. Galantamine is a cholinesterase inhibitor used to treat mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease by improving cognitive function. The other options are not appropriate: Acetazolamide is used for conditions like glaucoma or altitude sickness, Levodopa and carbidopa are used for Parkinson's disease, and Thiamine is used for Wernicke's encephalopathy.",9
10038,"The scenario describes a 3-year-old boy with a spiral fracture of the humerus and a rib fracture with callus formation. Spiral fractures in young children, especially in the absence of a clear, consistent, and plausible accidental mechanism, raise suspicion for non-accidental trauma (child abuse). Additionally, the presence of a rib fracture with callus formation suggests a previous injury that was healing, which is also concerning for abuse. The boy's refusal to use his arm and his clinging behavior may indicate fear or distress. Given these findings, the most appropriate next step is to ensure the child's safety and investigate the possibility of abuse. Notifying Child Protective Services (CPS) is crucial to initiate an investigation into the child's home environment and ensure his safety. Hospitalization or surgical treatment may be necessary later, but the immediate priority is to address the potential abuse. Screening for defective type I collagen would be considered if there were a suspicion of osteogenesis imperfecta, but the clinical presentation here is more suggestive of abuse.",9

10044,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), including severe tearing abdominal pain radiating to the back, hypotension, tachycardia, and confusion. These signs indicate hemodynamic instability, likely due to internal bleeding. In such cases, immediate surgical intervention is necessary to repair the aneurysm and control the bleeding. Imaging studies like CT or MRI are not appropriate in this emergency setting as they would delay life-saving treatment. Therefore, the most appropriate step is to proceed directly to surgery.",9
10047,"The clinical presentation of this 3-year-old boy suggests a condition that predisposes him to frequent fractures. The key points in the vignette include multiple fractures from minor trauma, decreased bone density on x-ray, and possibly other signs such as blue sclerae (which might be shown in the photograph mentioned). These findings are characteristic of osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic disorder that affects collagen synthesis, particularly type 1 collagen. Type 1 collagen is crucial for bone strength, and its defect leads to brittle bones that fracture easily. The other options, such as non-accidental injury, type 2 collagen defect, and type 3 collagen defect, do not align as well with the presentation of frequent fractures and decreased bone density. Non-accidental injury would not typically present with decreased bone density, and type 2 and type 3 collagen defects are associated with other conditions like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which do not primarily cause frequent fractures.",9
10050,"The child presents with polyuria, polydipsia, and hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. The lab findings show normal serum sodium, low chloride, low potassium, and high bicarbonate levels, indicating metabolic alkalosis. The urine shows hypercalciuria and high osmolality. These findings are consistent with Bartter syndrome, which is caused by a defect in the Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter in the thick ascending loop of Henle. This defect leads to impaired reabsorption of sodium, potassium, and chloride, causing hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hypercalciuria. The high urine osmolality suggests the kidneys are trying to concentrate urine despite the polyuria, which is typical in Bartter syndrome.",9
10051,"The clinical presentation of bilious vomiting in a newborn, along with the x-ray finding of no gas distal to the duodenum, suggests a diagnosis of intestinal obstruction, likely due to malrotation with midgut volvulus. This is a surgical emergency. The most appropriate next step is to confirm the diagnosis with an upper gastrointestinal contrast series, which can demonstrate the position of the duodenum and any abnormal rotation or volvulus. This imaging study is crucial before proceeding to surgery to ensure accurate diagnosis and planning.",9
10053,"The question asks about the regulation of the cell cycle, specifically in relation to the M phase where vinblastine acts. Vinblastine targets the M phase, which is the mitotic phase where cell division occurs. 

- Option A: Cyclin-dependent activation of CDK1 (also known as CDC2) is crucial for the cell to enter the M phase. CDK1, when activated by cyclins, helps drive the cell from the G2 phase into the M phase, making this statement correct.

- Option B: EGF (Epidermal Growth Factor) is involved in stimulating cell growth and proliferation, but this is more related to the G1 phase and not specifically the regulation of the M phase.

- Option C: Inhibitors of DNA synthesis typically act in the S phase, where DNA replication occurs, not the M phase.

- Option D: Replication of the genome occurs in the S phase, not the M phase. The M phase is where mitosis and cell division occur.

Therefore, the statement that best describes the regulation of the cell cycle in relation to the M phase is option A.",9
10063,"The infant's symptoms and physical findings are consistent with normal physiological processes. The blood-tinged vaginal discharge is likely due to withdrawal of maternal hormones, a common occurrence in newborns. The gray-blue patches on the back and buttocks are likely Mongolian spots, which are benign and common in infants, especially those of Asian, African, or Hispanic descent. The mild acne and breast buds are also due to maternal hormone exposure. Given these findings, there is no indication of infection or other pathology that requires treatment. Therefore, the most appropriate management is reassurance to the parents that these findings are normal and will resolve on their own.",9
10055,"The patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest interstitial lung disease, likely drug-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The key details include progressive breathlessness, dry cough, and imaging showing reticular opacities, which are consistent with pulmonary fibrosis. Among the medications listed, Amiodarone is well-known for causing pulmonary toxicity, including pulmonary fibrosis, especially with long-term use. The other medications, Lidocaine, Sotalol, and Verapamil, are not typically associated with this type of lung toxicity. Therefore, the most likely medication responsible for this patient's condition is Amiodarone.",9
10058,"The patient is an 82-year-old man with symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), including frequent urination, nocturia, and difficulty initiating urination. He is currently on terazosin, an alpha-blocker, which has provided some symptom relief. His prostate size is moderately enlarged at 50 grams, and he has a post-void residual volume of 120 mL, indicating incomplete bladder emptying. The presence of bladder wall trabeculation suggests chronic bladder outlet obstruction.

Given that he is already on an alpha-blocker (terazosin) and still has significant symptoms, adding a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor like finasteride is appropriate. Finasteride works by reducing the size of the prostate over time, which can help alleviate symptoms and reduce the risk of urinary retention. Oxybutynin is used for overactive bladder, which is not the primary issue here. Tadalafil can be used for BPH but is not typically added when an alpha-blocker is already in use. Tamsulosin is another alpha-blocker, similar to terazosin, and would not provide additional benefit in this case.",9
10064,"The clinical presentation of this patient is consistent with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Key features include multiple café-au-lait spots (hyperpigmented macules), axillary and inguinal freckling, neurofibromas (soft, painless nodules), and Lisch nodules (hyperpigmented iris nodules). NF1 is associated with an increased risk of developing certain tumors, one of which is optic glioma. Optic gliomas are common in children with NF1 and can lead to vision problems. The other conditions listed are not typically associated with NF1: glaucoma is not a common complication, renal cell carcinoma is more associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease, and giant cell astrocytoma is associated with tuberous sclerosis. Therefore, the correct answer is optic glioma.",9
10069,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a peritonsillar abscess, which is a complication of tonsillitis or pharyngitis. The key features include sore throat, difficulty swallowing, trismus (difficulty opening the mouth), fever, and a unilateral lesion superior to the tonsil. The negative rapid antigen detection test suggests that the sore throat is not due to group A streptococcus, which is commonly tested for. A peritonsillar abscess can lead to serious complications, one of which is Lemierre syndrome. Lemierre syndrome is a rare but serious condition that involves septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein, often following a peritonsillar abscess or other oropharyngeal infections. This condition can lead to systemic infection and septic emboli. Therefore, the serious complication of the most likely diagnosis (peritonsillar abscess) is Lemierre syndrome.",9
10070,"The patient has a history of asthma, chronic sinusitis, and nasal polyps, which raises the concern for aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), also known as Samter's triad. This condition is characterized by asthma, nasal polyps, and sensitivity to aspirin and other NSAIDs, which can lead to respiratory reactions. Before recommending aspirin therapy, it is crucial to determine if the patient has had any previous reactions to aspirin. Therefore, the best response is to inquire about any past reactions to aspirin.",9
1880,"The patient presents with signs and symptoms suggestive of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), including irregular menses, obesity, and signs of hyperandrogenism (acne and hirsutism). In PCOS, there is often chronic anovulation, which leads to unopposed estrogen stimulation of the endometrium. This can increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and eventually endometrial carcinoma due to the lack of progesterone to counterbalance the estrogen effect. Therefore, without treatment, the patient is at greatest risk for endometrial carcinoma.",9
10073,"The patient presents with chest pain and ST-segment elevations that resolve quickly, along with negative troponins, suggesting a non-ischemic cause of chest pain. Her history of smoking and use of sumatriptan, a vasoconstrictor, increases the likelihood of coronary vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina). Calcium channel blockers, such as diltiazem, are effective in preventing coronary vasospasm by causing vasodilation. Other options like ramipril (an ACE inhibitor), clopidogrel (an antiplatelet agent), and propranolol (a beta-blocker) are not effective in preventing vasospasm. In fact, beta-blockers can potentially worsen vasospasm by allowing unopposed alpha-adrenergic receptor activity.",9
10072,"The patient presents with crampy abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea five days post-surgery, which are key symptoms to consider. The history of severe blood loss and vasopressor use during surgery suggests a risk for ischemia. The use of vasopressors can lead to reduced blood flow to the intestines, increasing the risk of ischemic colitis. The presence of bloody stools and abdominal tenderness further supports this diagnosis. Postoperative ileus typically presents with absent bowel sounds and distention but not bloody stools. Pseudomembranous colitis, associated with antibiotic use, usually presents with watery diarrhea rather than bloody stools. An abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture would likely present with hemodynamic instability and severe abdominal or back pain, but the timing and symptoms are more consistent with ischemic colitis.",9
10079,"The patient's symptoms of exertional dyspnea and dizziness, along with weak peripheral pulses, suggest a condition affecting cardiac output. In an elderly patient, these symptoms are classic for aortic stenosis, which is characterized by a narrowed aortic valve leading to reduced blood flow from the heart. This condition often presents with a triad of symptoms: exertional dyspnea, syncope (or dizziness), and angina. The weak peripheral pulses are due to the reduced stroke volume. Aortic stenosis is common in older adults due to calcification of the aortic valve.",9
10083,"The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are suggestive of carpal tunnel syndrome, which is caused by compression of the median nerve at the wrist. The symptoms include pain and numbness in the first three digits, particularly at night, and are exacerbated by activities like driving. The Phalen's test, where hyperflexion of the wrist causes symptoms, supports this diagnosis. The confirmatory diagnostic test for carpal tunnel syndrome is nerve conduction studies, which measure the speed of electrical impulses through the median nerve and can confirm the presence of nerve compression.",9
10082,"The patient's symptoms and lab findings suggest an overdose of a salicylate, such as aspirin. The key symptoms include tinnitus (ringing in the ears), hyperventilation (increased respiratory rate), fever, nausea, dizziness, and confusion. The lab findings show a mixed acid-base disorder: a primary respiratory alkalosis (low Pco2) and a metabolic acidosis (low HCO3-), which is characteristic of salicylate toxicity. Aspirin overdose typically presents with these symptoms and lab findings, making it the most likely cause in this scenario.",9
1889,"The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of chronic hip pain due to osteoarthritis, for which he has been taking high doses of painkillers. He now presents with a respiratory rate of 10/min, which suggests possible respiratory depression, a known side effect of opioid use. The laboratory findings show eosinophilia (11%) and urinalysis reveals hematuria (RBC 7-8/HPF), pyuria (WBC 10-12/HPF), and proteinuria (1+ with 24-hour urine protein excretion of 0.9 g). The absence of casts and negative urine culture rule out infection. These findings are consistent with analgesic nephropathy, which is associated with long-term use of analgesics, particularly NSAIDs and combination analgesics, leading to chronic kidney damage. The eosinophilia and urinary findings support this diagnosis.",9

10084,"The patient is experiencing difficulty initiating sleep, which is a common symptom of insomnia. She also has social anxiety disorder and is concerned about morning drowsiness, which is important to consider when selecting a medication. 

- Doxepin is a tricyclic antidepressant that can be used for sleep maintenance insomnia, but it may cause morning drowsiness.
- Triazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine that is effective for sleep onset insomnia and is less likely to cause morning drowsiness due to its short half-life.
- Flurazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine that can cause significant morning drowsiness and is not ideal for someone who needs to be alert in the morning.
- Suvorexant is an orexin receptor antagonist used for sleep maintenance insomnia and can cause next-day drowsiness.

Given the need to avoid morning drowsiness and the specific issue with sleep initiation, Triazolam is the most appropriate choice for short-term treatment.",9
10089,"Zidovudine (AZT) is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) used in the treatment of HIV. It works by inhibiting the reverse transcriptase enzyme, which is responsible for converting viral RNA into DNA. This process is crucial for the replication of the virus. By inhibiting reverse transcriptase, zidovudine prevents the elongation of viral DNA, thereby reducing viral replication and transmission. The other options involve different stages of the HIV life cycle: integration of the viral genome (A) involves the enzyme integrase, cleavage of viral polypeptides (B) involves protease, and fusion of the virus with T cells (D) involves entry inhibitors. Therefore, the process most affected by zidovudine is the elongation of viral DNA.",9
10102,"The medication being considered is likely a bile acid sequestrant, such as cholestyramine, colestipol, or colesevelam. These drugs work by binding bile acids in the intestine, preventing their reabsorption. This forces the liver to use more cholesterol to produce new bile acids, thereby lowering LDL cholesterol levels. A common adverse effect of bile acid sequestrants is gastrointestinal disturbance, including fat malabsorption, because they can interfere with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and fats. This is due to the decreased availability of bile acids necessary for fat digestion and absorption.",9
10101,"The presentation of pruritic, erythematous, slightly raised annular patches with central clearing is suggestive of a dermatophyte infection, commonly known as ringworm or tinea corporis. To confirm this diagnosis, the presence of hyphae in skin scrapings when examined under a microscope with potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation is a classic diagnostic feature. This test helps identify fungal elements, confirming a dermatophyte infection. Other options do not align with the described presentation: A herald patch and lesions along skin cleavage lines suggest pityriasis rosea, symmetrical distribution on extremities suggests psoriasis, and a history of time spent in a Lyme-endemic region is related to Lyme disease, which does not match the skin findings described.",9
10096,"The patient's symptoms of dysphagia, regurgitation of undigested food, bad breath, and gurgling sounds suggest a structural or motility disorder of the esophagus. The absence of systemic symptoms like fever or weight loss makes malignancy less likely. The history of Raynaud disease and the use of nifedipine suggest a possible connective tissue disorder, but the symptoms are more indicative of a mechanical issue. The key symptoms of food getting stuck and regurgitation, along with bad breath, are classic for Zenker's diverticulum, which is a pharyngoesophageal diverticulum. A barium esophagram is the best test to visualize such a diverticulum, as it will show the outpouching in the esophagus. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) might miss the diverticulum if it is not carefully inspected, and it is more invasive. Serology and PCR are not relevant for this presentation, and esophageal pH monitoring is used for diagnosing GERD, which does not match the symptom profile here.",9
10106,"The newborn is presenting with signs of sepsis, including poor feeding, irritability, lethargy, fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and jaundice. The history of premature rupture of membranes increases the risk of infection. The APGAR scores indicate some initial distress, and the current examination shows respiratory distress with subcostal retractions and nasal flaring, as well as prolonged capillary refill time, suggesting possible shock. In a newborn with suspected sepsis, the most appropriate immediate management step is to start broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for potential pathogens. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to initiate antibiotic therapy with ampicillin and gentamicin.",9
10108,"The patient's age and the characteristics of the breast mass are key to determining the most likely cause. She is 24 years old, which makes malignant conditions like ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and inflammatory carcinoma less likely, as these are more common in older women. The mass is described as firm, mobile, and with well-defined margins, which are typical features of a fibroadenoma, a benign breast tumor common in young women. Occasional tenderness can also be associated with fibroadenomas. A phyllodes tumor could present similarly, but it is less common and often larger or rapidly growing. The mammography showing a dense lesion is consistent with a fibroadenoma. Therefore, the most likely cause is a fibroadenoma.",9
10085,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of tinea corporis, a superficial fungal infection of the skin, especially given his occupation as a lifeguard, which involves frequent exposure to moist environments. The rash is described as pruritic and progressively enlarging, which is characteristic of tinea infections. The most appropriate treatment for tinea corporis is an antifungal agent. Topical miconazole, an antifungal cream, is suitable for treating this condition. Other options such as topical erythromycin, phototherapy, and topical hydrocortisone are not appropriate for a fungal infection.",9
10115,"The newborn presents with fever, irritability, lethargy, poor feeding, and signs of sepsis, including tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension. The CSF findings of pleocytosis and low glucose suggest bacterial meningitis. In a newborn, the most common causes of bacterial meningitis are Group B Streptococcus (GBS), E. coli, and Listeria monocytogenes. Given the lack of prenatal care and prolonged rupture of membranes, the risk of GBS transmission is increased. Cryptococcus neoformans is not a typical cause of neonatal meningitis and is more associated with immunocompromised patients. Enterovirus can cause meningitis but typically presents differently and is not associated with low CSF glucose. Streptococcus pneumoniae is more common in older children and adults. Therefore, the most likely causative organism in this case is Group B Streptococcus.",9
1920,"The patient was involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision and presents with respiratory distress, chest pain, and decreased breath sounds over the left base. The presence of a laceration on the left side of the chest and tenderness in the left upper quadrant suggests possible thoracoabdominal injury. The chest x-ray, although not visible here, likely shows abnormal findings that correlate with the clinical presentation.

Diaphragmatic rupture is a common injury in blunt trauma, especially on the left side due to the protective effect of the liver on the right side. It can lead to herniation of abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity, causing respiratory distress and decreased breath sounds due to lung compression.

Esophageal perforation is less likely given the mechanism of injury and the absence of signs like subcutaneous emphysema or mediastinal widening.

Diaphragmatic eventration is a congenital condition and would not present acutely after trauma.

Phrenic nerve palsy would cause diaphragmatic paralysis but is less likely in this traumatic context without specific nerve injury signs.

Given the mechanism of injury and clinical findings, diaphragmatic rupture is the most likely diagnosis.",9
10117,"The study described involves following two groups of people over time: those who consume the food additive and those who do not. The researcher is interested in observing the development of cancer and other health outcomes in these groups. This prospective approach, where participants are followed over time to see if they develop the outcomes of interest, is characteristic of a cohort study. In a cohort study, the exposure status is determined at the start, and the outcomes are observed over time, which matches the description provided.",9
10121,"The patient has severe acne that has not responded to previous treatments. The presence of numerous open comedones and sebaceous lesions suggests a need for a more aggressive treatment approach. Isotretinoin is often used for severe, recalcitrant acne. However, isotretinoin is teratogenic, so it is crucial to ensure the patient is not pregnant before starting treatment. Therefore, measuring serum beta-hCG levels is indicated to rule out pregnancy before initiating isotretinoin therapy.",9
10125,"The scenario describes a situation where the relationship between asthma and myocardial infarction (MI) risk differs between male and female patients. In females, asthma is a significant predictor of MI risk, while in males, it is not. This suggests that the effect of asthma on MI risk is modified by biological sex. Effect modification occurs when the effect of the main exposure (asthma) on the outcome (MI) differs depending on the level of another variable (biological sex). This is different from confounding, which would imply a third variable is distorting the observed relationship, and measurement bias, which would involve errors in data collection. Stratified sampling refers to the method of dividing the population into subgroups, but it does not explain the difference in effect observed between the subgroups. Therefore, the best explanation for the observed difference is effect modification.",9
10131,"The patient's symptoms of nonbloody diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and bloating, along with the decreased stool pH, suggest a malabsorption issue. The fact that his coworkers had similar symptoms for a shorter duration indicates a possible infectious cause initially, but the patient's prolonged symptoms suggest a different underlying issue. Decreased stool pH is often associated with carbohydrate malabsorption, such as lactose intolerance. Lactase deficiency leads to lactose malabsorption, resulting in fermentation by colonic bacteria, producing lactic acid and other short-chain fatty acids, which lower stool pH. This matches the patient's symptoms and stool findings.",9
10134,"The patient presents with difficulty falling asleep, a common symptom of insomnia. Her history suggests poor sleep habits, such as drinking caffeinated tea close to bedtime and using her cell phone in bed, which can interfere with sleep onset. There is no indication of sleep apnea (no snoring or abnormal breathing), so CPAP is not appropriate. Modafinil is used for excessive daytime sleepiness, not insomnia. Ropinirole is used for restless legs syndrome, which is not indicated here. The best initial management for insomnia related to poor sleep habits is to improve sleep hygiene, which includes avoiding caffeine close to bedtime and reducing screen time before sleep.",9
10136,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest a diagnosis of diphtheria, caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The key features include a sore throat, fever, difficulty swallowing, and the presence of a grayish-white membrane in the oropharynx. The patient is unvaccinated, which increases the likelihood of diphtheria. The gram stain shows gram-positive club-shaped bacilli, consistent with Corynebacterium species. 

Corynebacterium diphtheriae can be cultured on specific media. Tellurite agar is a selective medium used for isolating C. diphtheriae, where it forms characteristic small black colonies due to the reduction of tellurite to tellurium. This is a classic diagnostic feature for diphtheria.",9
10141,"The patient initially consented to the surgery but has now withdrawn her consent. Informed consent is a continuous process, and a patient has the right to withdraw consent at any time. The surgeon has explained the risks of not proceeding with the surgery, and the patient understands these risks but still refuses the procedure. Respecting patient autonomy is a fundamental principle in medical ethics. Therefore, the most appropriate action is to respect her decision and cancel the surgery.",9
10135,"The patient is presenting with signs of hypovolemic shock due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by vomiting bright red blood, hypotension, tachycardia, and cool, pale skin. In hypovolemic shock, there is a loss of blood volume leading to decreased cardiac output. The body compensates by increasing peripheral vascular resistance to maintain blood pressure and perfusion to vital organs. Therefore, an increase in peripheral vascular resistance is a feature of this condition. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure would typically decrease due to reduced preload, and hemoglobin and hematocrit concentrations initially remain unchanged until fluid resuscitation or further blood loss occurs.",9
10127,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of ankylosing spondylitis, a type of inflammatory arthritis that typically presents with back pain that is worse in the morning and improves with activity. This condition often affects young men and can lead to decreased spinal mobility. The minor decrease in air movement bilaterally at the lung bases could be related to decreased chest expansion, a feature of ankylosing spondylitis. The best initial imaging study to evaluate for ankylosing spondylitis is an X-ray of the lumbosacral spine, which can reveal characteristic changes such as sacroiliitis.",9
10143,"The patient presents with acute eye pain, blurry vision, and difficulty opening the eye, which are symptoms suggestive of an eye infection. The fact that he wears contact lenses is a significant risk factor for bacterial keratitis, particularly with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pseudomonas keratitis is a common and serious infection in contact lens wearers, characterized by rapid progression and severe pain. The other options are less likely: Staphylococcus aureus keratitis is possible but less common in contact lens wearers; angle-closure glaucoma would present with a different set of symptoms, including a fixed, mid-dilated pupil and possibly systemic symptoms; herpes zoster keratitis would typically have a history of vesicular rash or dermatomal pain. Given the acute presentation and contact lens use, Pseudomonas keratitis is the most likely diagnosis.",9
10154,"The clinical presentation and x-ray findings are suggestive of osteosarcoma, a common bone malignancy in adolescents. The key features include pain, swelling, and characteristic x-ray findings such as sclerosis, cortical destruction, and new bone formation with a ""sunburst"" pattern due to spiculae radiating from the bone. Osteosarcoma is a malignant tumor that arises from osteoblasts, which are cells responsible for bone formation. Osteoblasts originate from the periosteum, the connective tissue layer covering the bone. Therefore, the malignancy is derived from cells in the periosteum.",9
10151,"The patient's MRI shows a hyperintense mass extending into the right foramen rotundum. The foramen rotundum is an opening in the sphenoid bone through which the maxillary nerve (V2), a branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN V), passes. The maxillary nerve provides sensory innervation to the midface, including the cheekbone, nasolabial fold, and upper lip. Therefore, a mass affecting the foramen rotundum would likely impact the maxillary nerve, leading to decreased sensation in these areas. 

Option A describes decreased sensation over the cheekbone, nasolabial fold, and upper lip, which corresponds to the sensory distribution of the maxillary nerve. 

Option B involves the facial nerve (CN VII), which is not related to the foramen rotundum. 

Option C involves the ophthalmic nerve (V1) and the corneal reflex, which is not related to the foramen rotundum. 

Option D involves the mandibular nerve (V3), which is not related to the foramen rotundum.

Thus, the most likely finding is decreased sensation over the areas innervated by the maxillary nerve.",9
10161,"The renal clearance of a substance is determined by its filtration, reabsorption, and secretion. If the amount excreted is greater than the amount filtered, it indicates that the substance is not only filtered but also secreted into the renal tubules. 

- **Magnesium (A)**: Primarily filtered and partially reabsorbed, not secreted.
- **Bicarbonate (B)**: Filtered and reabsorbed, not secreted.
- **Para-amino hippuric acid (C)**: Filtered and actively secreted, making its excretion greater than the amount filtered. It is often used to measure renal plasma flow because of its high clearance.
- **Glucose (D)**: Filtered and completely reabsorbed under normal conditions, not secreted.

Given that substance Y is excreted in greater amounts than filtered, it is most similar to para-amino hippuric acid, which is both filtered and secreted.",9
10157,"The clinical presentation of this 8-year-old boy, including progressive visual loss, hearing and speech deterioration, difficulty walking, hyperpigmented skin, ataxic gait, spasticity, decreased muscle strength, hyperreflexia, extensor plantar response, decreased sensation, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss, suggests a neurodegenerative disorder. The family history of a maternal male cousin with similar symptoms who died at a young age suggests an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern.

The symptoms and inheritance pattern are consistent with adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), a disorder caused by dysfunction of the ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCD1 gene), leading to the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids in tissues, particularly affecting the nervous system and adrenal glands. This results in the progressive neurological decline and adrenal insufficiency seen in ALD.

The other options do not fit the clinical picture as well:
- β-Glucocerebrosidase deficiency is associated with Gaucher disease, which presents differently.
- Arylsulfatase A deficiency causes metachromatic leukodystrophy, which has a different inheritance pattern and presentation.
- α-Galactosidase A deficiency causes Fabry disease, which presents with angiokeratomas, pain crises, and renal issues, not the neurological decline seen here.

Thus, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is dysfunction of the ATP-binding cassette transporter, consistent with adrenoleukodystrophy.",9

10171,"The patient presents with generalized edema, frothy urine, and significant proteinuria (5.1 g/24 hours), which are indicative of nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and edema. The edema is primarily due to hypoalbuminemia, which results from the loss of albumin in the urine. Albumin is a major plasma protein that helps maintain oncotic pressure in the blood vessels. When albumin levels drop, oncotic pressure decreases, leading to fluid leakage into the interstitial spaces and causing edema. The presence of fat globules in the urine (lipiduria) is also consistent with nephrotic syndrome. While hyperlipidemia is a feature of nephrotic syndrome, it is not the direct cause of edema. Loss of antithrombin III and globulin in the urine can occur but are not the primary causes of edema.",9
10172,"The patient's symptoms of chronic cough, recurrent dyspnea, history of smoking, and exacerbations suggest a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma. The family history of allergic disorders and his occupation as a farmer could also suggest occupational asthma or another form of obstructive lung disease. In obstructive lung diseases, spirometry typically shows a decreased FEV1 and a decreased FEV1/FVC ratio. The flow-volume loop would show a scooped-out pattern due to obstruction. In COPD, particularly emphysema, there is often an increase in total lung capacity (TLC) due to air trapping and hyperinflation. Therefore, the most likely finding in his pulmonary function test would be an increased TLC.",9
1989,"The clinical presentation of the 4-year-old girl includes abdominal swelling, massive splenomegaly, frontal bossing, malar prominence, rib beading, pale oral mucosa, and a dusky complexion. These findings suggest a chronic hemolytic anemia, likely due to a hemoglobinopathy. The frontal bossing and malar prominence are indicative of bone marrow expansion due to increased erythropoiesis, which is a compensatory mechanism in chronic anemia. The massive splenomegaly is also consistent with extramedullary hematopoiesis and sequestration of abnormal red blood cells. The rib beading could be related to bone changes from chronic anemia. Given the patient's origin from Bangladesh, a region where thalassemia is prevalent, and the clinical findings, the most likely explanation is extramedullary hematopoiesis due to thalassemia.",9
1996,"The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and presents with symptoms suggestive of a severe exacerbation, possibly complicated by toxic megacolon. The presence of fever, tachycardia, hypotension, abdominal distension, and hypoactive bowel sounds raises concern for this complication. Toxic megacolon is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt diagnosis and management. An abdominal x-ray is the most appropriate next step to evaluate for colonic dilation, which is a hallmark of toxic megacolon. Other options like colonoscopy or barium enema are contraindicated in this scenario due to the risk of perforation.",9
2046,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of bacterial meningitis, likely caused by Neisseria meningitidis, given the presence of petechiae (purple spots) and the CSF findings (neutrophilic pleocytosis, low glucose, high protein). In a 1-year-old child, the most appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy for suspected bacterial meningitis includes ceftriaxone or cefotaxime plus vancomycin to cover the most common pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. Additionally, close contacts of a patient with meningococcal meningitis require prophylaxis to prevent spread. Rifampin is commonly used for this purpose. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to administer ceftriaxone and vancomycin to the patient and provide rifampin prophylaxis to close contacts.",9
2050,"The patient's symptoms and MRI findings suggest early-onset Alzheimer's disease, characterized by memory impairment and atrophy in the medial temporal lobes and hippocampi. In cases of early-onset Alzheimer's, genetic mutations such as those in presenilin 1 (PSEN1) are common. The presence of the ApoE ε4 allele is associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease, not early-onset. Noncoding hexanucleotide repeats are associated with frontotemporal dementia, and CAG trinucleotide repeat expansions are linked to Huntington's disease. Therefore, the most likely genetic alteration in this case is a mutation in presenilin 1.",9
2090,"The patient is being treated with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir. Each of these medications has specific adverse effects. Lamivudine is generally well-tolerated but can cause pancreatitis, especially in pediatric patients. Zidovudine is known for causing bone marrow suppression, leading to anemia and neutropenia, and can also cause hyperpigmentation of the nails and skin. Indinavir, a protease inhibitor, is associated with the development of urolithiasis (kidney stones) due to crystallization of the drug in the renal tubules. Given the options and the medications involved, the most likely adverse effect for this patient is urolithiasis due to indinavir.",9
2106,"The patient is a 30-year-old African American man with a family history of hypertension and a BMI indicating he is overweight. His blood pressure readings over three visits are consistently elevated, indicating stage 1 hypertension. His laboratory tests are normal, and there is no evidence of diabetes or renal issues. Lifestyle modifications are the first-line treatment for stage 1 hypertension, especially in the absence of compelling indications for immediate pharmacotherapy. These modifications include weight loss, increased physical activity, and dietary changes such as salt restriction. Given his family history and current health status, recommending lifestyle changes is appropriate before initiating medication.",9
2131,"The patient's symptoms of headaches, irregular menses, and galactorrhea (nipple discharge) suggest hyperprolactinemia, likely due to a prolactinoma, as indicated by the MRI of the brain. Hyperprolactinemia inhibits the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), leading to decreased secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). This results in decreased ovarian production of estrogen and progesterone. Dopamine acts as a prolactin-inhibiting factor, so in the presence of a prolactinoma, dopamine synthesis may increase as a compensatory mechanism to try to reduce prolactin levels. Therefore, the expected changes are decreased serum estrogen, decreased serum progesterone, and increased dopamine synthesis.",9
2130,"The patient's symptoms and travel history suggest a parasitic infection. The key features include abdominal pain, itchy rash, diarrhea, and a high eosinophil count. The serpiginous rash is characteristic of cutaneous larva migrans, often caused by hookworm larvae. The eosinophilia and gastrointestinal symptoms further support a parasitic infection. In this context, the most likely finding on further evaluation would be rhabditiform larvae in the stool, which is associated with Strongyloides stercoralis infection, a common parasitic infection in tropical regions like Indonesia.",9
2138,"The lesion described is suggestive of melanoma, given its irregular borders and color variation. In melanoma, the risk of metastasis is best estimated by the depth of invasion, which is assessed by the presence of vertical tumor growth. Vertical growth phase indicates that the tumor is invading deeper into the dermis, which correlates with a higher risk of metastasis. Palisading nuclei, cellular atypia, and increased production of melanosomes are not directly related to the metastatic potential of melanoma.",9
2233,"The patient's symptoms, including joint pain, morning stiffness, a malar rash, and oral ulcers, are suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The family history of similar complaints also supports this suspicion. In SLE, the most specific serological test is the presence of anti-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies. While anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) are sensitive for SLE, they are not specific. Anti-dsDNA antibodies, on the other hand, are highly specific for SLE and can also correlate with disease activity. Anti-histone antibodies are more associated with drug-induced lupus, anti-topoisomerase antibodies are specific for systemic sclerosis, and anti-Ro antibodies are associated with Sjögren's syndrome and subacute cutaneous lupus but are not as specific for SLE as anti-dsDNA antibodies.",9
2217,"The description of cells grouped in acini with ducts suggests a glandular structure, likely the pancreas. The presence of pale cells with a rich blood supply among basophilic and granular cells is characteristic of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. These islets contain different types of endocrine cells, such as alpha, beta, and delta cells, which cannot be differentiated by light microscopy alone. Therefore, the correct statement is that there are several different types of cells within the patch that cannot be differentiated by light microscopy.",9
2234,"The patient's symptoms and history are suggestive of chronic bronchitis, a form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The key features include a chronic productive cough for at least 3 months in 2 consecutive years, which aligns with the patient's history. The lack of improvement with inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators, along with the smoking history, further supports this diagnosis. The chest X-ray findings of increased bronchovascular markings and mild cardiomegaly are also consistent with chronic bronchitis. In chronic bronchitis, the primary pathological change is hyperplasia of the mucus-secreting glands in the airways, leading to increased mucus production. This is reflected in the Reid index, which measures the thickness of the gland layer to the total thickness of the bronchial wall. Therefore, on lung biopsy, hyperplasia of the mucus glands in the airways would be the most likely finding.",9
2290,"The patient was treated with a broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic for a urinary tract infection, likely pyelonephritis given the symptoms and urinalysis findings. The transient visual blurring and falls suggest vestibular toxicity, which is a known side effect of aminoglycosides. Aminoglycosides, such as gentamicin, work by inhibiting the 30S ribosomal subunit, leading to protein synthesis inhibition. This mechanism of action aligns with option A. Other options do not match the typical side effects or mechanism of action associated with vestibular toxicity.",9
2269,"The clinical presentation suggests thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction, neurological symptoms, and fever. The peripheral blood smear likely shows schistocytes, indicating hemolysis. In TTP, we expect elevated bilirubin due to hemolysis, elevated reticulocyte count as the bone marrow responds to anemia, and potentially elevated creatinine due to renal involvement. PT and PTT are typically normal in TTP as it is not a coagulation disorder but a platelet consumption disorder. Therefore, the least likely finding in this context is elevated creatinine, as renal involvement is variable and not as consistent as the other findings.",9
2318,"The patient's symptoms are indicative of cerebellar dysfunction, particularly affecting the left side. The symptoms include difficulty walking, falling to the left, nystagmus with fast beats to the left, dysmetria, tremor, dysdiadochokinesia, and a wide-based gait. These are classic signs of cerebellar ataxia. The history of alcoholism and cirrhosis suggests a potential nutritional deficiency, particularly thiamine (vitamin B1), which can lead to Wernicke's encephalopathy. However, the specific symptoms here are more localized to the cerebellum rather than the broader symptoms of Wernicke's. The presence of a left-sided cerebellar lesion, such as a tumor, would explain the unilateral cerebellar signs. The other options, such as trinucleotide repeats, are associated with conditions like Huntington's disease, which does not match this presentation. A posterior capsular infarct would cause different symptoms, primarily affecting motor or sensory pathways rather than cerebellar function. Therefore, the most likely finding is a left-sided cerebellar tumor.",9
2322,"The patient has elevated blood glucose levels and an HbA1c of 8.9%, indicating poorly controlled diabetes. The physician prescribes a medication and advises monitoring liver enzymes, suggesting a concern for potential hepatotoxicity. Among the options, thiazolidinediones (e.g., pioglitazone) are known to require liver function monitoring due to potential liver side effects. Thiazolidinediones work by acting as agonists at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Ƴ (PPAR-Ƴ), which increases insulin sensitivity. This matches option C.",9
2275,,0
2343,"The patient's symptoms are indicative of cognitive decline, particularly memory issues, which are common in dementia. The CT scan likely shows findings consistent with Alzheimer's disease, which is characterized by cortical atrophy. This atrophy leads to the enlargement of the ventricles and sulci, which would be visible on the CT scan. Increased CSF production, congenital malformation, or infection are less likely to present with the gradual cognitive decline and specific CT findings described. Therefore, the most likely cause of the CT findings in this context is cortical atrophy due to Alzheimer's disease.",9
2355,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of toxic shock syndrome (TSS), which is often associated with the use of tampons. TSS is caused by the exotoxin produced by Staphylococcus aureus, known as toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1). This toxin acts as a superantigen, which means it can non-specifically activate a large number of T cells. Superantigens bind to the variable beta portion of the T-cell receptor (TCR) and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells, leading to massive cytokine release and the symptoms observed in TSS. Therefore, the molecule on T cells that the superantigen binds to is the variable beta portion of the TCR.",10
2379,"In cases of fingertip amputation, the goal is to preserve the amputated part for possible reattachment. The correct method involves keeping the amputated part cool and moist without direct contact with ice, which can cause tissue damage. The best practice is to wrap the fingertip in gauze dampened with saline, place it in a sealed plastic bag, and then place that bag on ice or in ice water. This method keeps the tissue cool and viable for reattachment while preventing direct ice contact that could cause frostbite or further tissue damage.",9
2387,"The question describes three pathways of programmed cell death, which are essentially different mechanisms of apoptosis. The three pathways mentioned are: 1) death receptor pathway (extrinsic pathway), 2) mitochondrial pathway (intrinsic pathway), and 3) granzyme pathway (involving cytotoxic T cells). 

1. **Death receptor pathway**: This involves transmembrane receptors like Fas (CD95) and TNF receptors. Activation of these receptors leads to the activation of initiator caspases, such as caspase-8, which then activate executioner caspases like caspase-3.

2. **Mitochondrial pathway**: This involves the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, which leads to the formation of the apoptosome and activation of initiator caspase-9, which then activates executioner caspases like caspase-3.

3. **Granzyme pathway**: Cytotoxic T cells release granzymes into target cells, which can directly activate executioner caspases like caspase-3.

Caspase-3 is a key executioner caspase that is activated in all three pathways, leading to the biochemical and morphological changes associated with apoptosis. Therefore, caspase-3 is the common component in all three pathways.",9
2450,"The symptoms described in the vignette are suggestive of Huntington's disease, which is characterized by mood changes, chorea (jerky movements), and cognitive decline. Huntington's disease is a genetic disorder that leads to degeneration of neurons in specific areas of the brain, particularly the caudate nucleus and putamen. This degeneration results in decreased levels of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) and acetylcholine in these areas. The decrease in GABA is particularly notable and is a hallmark of the disease, leading to the characteristic movement disorders and other symptoms. Therefore, the expected change in the brain of this patient would be decreased GABA at the caudate.",9

2454,"The patient presents with signs and symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis: hypotension (blood pressure 84/54 mmHg), tachycardia (pulse 130/min), respiratory distress (wheezing), and a diffuse urticarial rash. Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction that requires immediate treatment. The first-line treatment for anaphylaxis is intramuscular epinephrine, as it rapidly reverses the symptoms by causing vasoconstriction, bronchodilation, and reducing vascular permeability. While albuterol can help with wheezing, it does not address the systemic effects of anaphylaxis. Diphenhydramine can be used as an adjunct for urticaria but is not the first-line treatment. Continuous monitoring is important but does not address the acute management of anaphylaxis.",10
2479,"The clinical scenario describes a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD), also known as a Marcus Gunn pupil, which is characterized by the pupils constricting less (or appearing to dilate) when light is shined in the affected eye compared to the unaffected eye. This occurs due to a defect in the afferent pathway of the pupillary light reflex. The afferent pathway involves the optic nerve, which carries sensory information from the retina to the brain. In this case, when the light is shined in the right eye, both pupils constrict less, indicating a defect in the right optic nerve. When the light is shined in the left eye, both pupils constrict more, indicating that the left optic nerve is functioning normally. Therefore, the most likely site of the lesion is the right optic nerve.",9
2457,"The patient is a 16-year-old girl with primary amenorrhea, normal breast development, coarse pubic and axillary hair, a blind vaginal pouch, normal ovaries, and an atretic uterus. These findings suggest a condition where there is normal ovarian function (as indicated by breast development) but an absence or underdevelopment of the uterus and upper vagina. This is consistent with Mullerian agenesis (Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome), which is due to agenesis of the paramesonephric (Mullerian) duct. The presence of normal secondary sexual characteristics like breast development and pubic hair indicates normal estrogen and androgen levels, ruling out enzyme deficiencies like 5-alpha reductase or 17-alpha-hydroxylase. Monosomy of sex chromosomes (Turner syndrome) would typically present with streak ovaries and lack of secondary sexual characteristics, which is not the case here.",9
2515,"The presentation described is consistent with achondroplasia, a condition characterized by disproportionate short stature with normal trunk size and larger head size. This condition is often inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which aligns with the mother's statement that the boy gets this from his father. Achondroplasia is caused by a mutation in the FGFR3 gene, specifically an overactivation of the FGFR3 receptor. This mutation leads to inhibited chondrocyte proliferation in the growth plate, resulting in shortened limbs. Therefore, the mutation associated with this presentation is an overactivation of FGFR3.",9
2523,"The patient is showing signs of infection following burn injuries, with blood cultures growing gram-negative, oxidase-positive, non-lactose fermenting rods, which are characteristic of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This organism is known for its virulence factors, including exotoxin A, which inhibits protein synthesis by ADP-ribosylating elongation factor 2 (EF-2). This mechanism is similar to that of diphtheria toxin and is a key factor in the pathogenicity of Pseudomonas infections, especially in burn patients.",9
2610,"The patient is a 29-year-old woman with a well-defined, rubbery, mobile, nontender mass in the breast. The characteristics of the mass (well-defined, rubbery, mobile) are classic for a fibroadenoma, which is a common benign breast tumor in young women. The history of trauma and dense breasts are not specific to any particular diagnosis, but the lack of pain and the description of the mass are more consistent with a fibroadenoma than with fat necrosis, which often presents with a more irregular, firm mass and may be associated with skin changes. Phyllodes tumors are typically larger and can grow rapidly, and fibrocystic changes usually present with multiple, tender, and often bilateral lumps that fluctuate with the menstrual cycle. Given the age of the patient and the characteristics of the mass, fibroadenoma is the most likely diagnosis.",9
2605,"The clinical presentation of short stature, recurrent diarrhea, and iron deficiency anemia in a 13-year-old boy, along with positive serum anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) antibodies, is highly suggestive of celiac disease. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. The characteristic histopathologic finding in celiac disease is villous atrophy, which is described as blunting of the intestinal villi. This results in malabsorption and the associated symptoms. Other options, such as granulomas, crypt aplasia, and cuboidal appearance of basal epithelial cells, are not typical findings in celiac disease. Granulomas are more associated with Crohn's disease, crypt aplasia is not a recognized feature of celiac disease, and cuboidal appearance of basal epithelial cells is not relevant here.",9
2494,"The patient is presenting with symptoms suggestive of pyelonephritis: fever, flank pain, and costovertebral angle tenderness. This is more severe than a simple urinary tract infection (UTI). For pyelonephritis, especially with a high fever and systemic symptoms, treatment typically involves antibiotics that cover gram-negative organisms like E. coli. Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone that is appropriate for outpatient management of uncomplicated pyelonephritis in stable patients. Nitrofurantoin is used for uncomplicated cystitis and is not appropriate for pyelonephritis. Ceftriaxone and hospital admission might be considered if the patient were more unstable or unable to take oral medications, but the question suggests outpatient management is feasible. Abscess drainage is not indicated as there is no evidence of an abscess.",9
2626,"The patient is experiencing a hypertensive emergency, and the drug described is likely nitroprusside. Nitroprusside is a potent vasodilator that acts by releasing nitric oxide, leading to increased peripheral venous capacitance and rapid reduction in blood pressure. It has a very rapid onset of action and requires continuous infusion due to its short half-life. One of the most severe side effects of nitroprusside is cyanide toxicity, which can occur because nitroprusside releases cyanide ions as it is metabolized. This is particularly a concern with prolonged use or high doses.",9
2620,"The patient presents with signs of virilization, including oligomenorrhea, increased hair growth, temporal hair recession, nodulocystic acne, and clitoral enlargement. These symptoms suggest an increase in androgen levels. The laboratory findings show increased serum testosterone with normal androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone levels, indicating that the source of excess androgens is likely ovarian rather than adrenal. The presence of a right adnexal mass and a 10-cm ovarian tumor on ultrasonography further supports an ovarian source. Among the options, a Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor is known to produce testosterone and cause virilization. The other options are less likely to cause the specific hormonal profile and symptoms observed in this patient.",9
2627,"The patient presents with signs of respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and physical exam findings suggestive of a pleural effusion or hemothorax (decreased breath sounds, dullness to percussion). The chest X-ray findings of increased opacity and tracheal deviation to the right further support the presence of a large pleural effusion or hemothorax on the left side. Given the history of rib fractures and recent trauma, a hemothorax is likely. The most appropriate next step in management for a suspected hemothorax is to insert a chest tube to drain the blood and re-expand the lung, which will help improve the patient's respiratory status.",9
2681,"The patient initially presented with symptoms suggestive of infective endocarditis, given his history of IV drug use, fever, and a cardiac murmur. He was treated and improved, but then developed profuse watery diarrhea and abdominal pain. This new symptomatology is likely due to antibiotic-associated diarrhea, specifically Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), which is common after antibiotic treatment for infections like endocarditis. CDI is characterized by the presence of pseudomembranes in the colon, which are composed of fibrin, inflammatory cells, and necrotic debris. Therefore, the most likely underlying diagnosis for his current symptoms is CDI, and the finding associated with this condition is pseudomembranes of fibrin.",9
2630,"The patient's symptoms include shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, fatigue, fever, night sweats, distended neck veins, and hepatomegaly. These symptoms, along with the echocardiography findings, suggest cardiac involvement. The faint systolic murmur and the presence of fever and night sweats point towards an infectious process. Infective endocarditis can cause these symptoms due to vegetations on the heart valves leading to embolic phenomena and systemic symptoms. The distended neck veins and hepatomegaly suggest right-sided heart involvement, which can occur with tricuspid valve endocarditis, often seen in infective endocarditis. Myocardial infarction and rheumatic fever are less likely to present with these systemic symptoms and the specific combination of findings. Small cell lung cancer could cause paraneoplastic syndromes but is less directly related to these cardiac findings. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause is infective endocarditis.",9
2662,"The patient is experiencing urinary retention due to a neurogenic bladder, likely caused by his spinal cord injury. The urodynamic studies indicate detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia, where the detrusor muscle and internal urethral sphincter contract simultaneously, preventing effective bladder emptying. This condition is common in patients with spinal cord injuries above the sacral level. 

The goal of treatment is to relax the internal urethral sphincter to allow for better bladder emptying. Prazosin, an alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist, can help by relaxing the smooth muscle of the internal urethral sphincter, thereby reducing the outflow resistance and facilitating urination.

Neostigmine and bethanechol are cholinergic agents that stimulate bladder contraction, which is not needed here since the detrusor is already contracting. Phenylephrine is an alpha-1 agonist, which would worsen the condition by increasing sphincter contraction.

Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is prazosin.",9
2692,"The patient's symptoms are indicative of a manic episode, characterized by elevated mood, increased energy, decreased need for sleep, and impulsive behavior. The fast speech, grandiosity, and unusual behavior such as driving home naked suggest mania. Bipolar disorder type I is diagnosed when there is at least one manic episode, which fits this patient's presentation. Bipolar disorder type II involves hypomanic episodes, which are less severe than manic episodes and do not include psychotic features or significant impairment. Major depressive disorder does not include manic episodes, and brief psychotic disorder involves psychotic symptoms without the mood disturbance seen here.",9
2723,"The patient's symptoms and history are suggestive of peripheral artery disease (PAD), characterized by intermittent claudication. The risk factors include smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of cardiovascular disease. The physical exam findings of glossy skin and loss of hair, along with diminished pulses, support this diagnosis. The best initial therapy for PAD, especially with intermittent claudication, is lifestyle modifications, particularly smoking cessation and a structured exercise program. These interventions can improve symptoms and overall cardiovascular health. Pharmacological treatments like clopidogrel are used for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events, but they are not the first-line treatment for symptom relief in PAD. Angioplasty and stenting or arterial bypass surgery are considered for more severe cases or when conservative measures fail.",9
2741,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a pulmonary-renal syndrome, characterized by hemoptysis, renal impairment, and systemic symptoms such as fever and joint pain. The laboratory findings show anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated BUN and creatinine, and urinalysis with hematuria and proteinuria, indicating possible glomerulonephritis. The differential diagnosis includes Goodpasture syndrome, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), and other vasculitides. 

Goodpasture syndrome is associated with anti-GBM antibodies, which target type IV collagen in the basement membrane. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is associated with c-ANCA, while microscopic polyangiitis is associated with p-ANCA. 

Given the presentation, it is crucial to differentiate between these conditions to guide treatment. Testing for type IV collagen antibodies (anti-GBM) would help confirm Goodpasture syndrome, which fits the clinical picture of pulmonary hemorrhage and renal involvement. Therefore, the best next step is to check for type IV collagen antibody levels.",9
2537,,0
2826,"The patient's symptoms and lab findings are suggestive of hereditary hemochromatosis, a condition characterized by excessive iron deposition in various organs. The joint findings, including beak-like osteophytes and involvement of the metacarpophalangeal joints, are typical of hemochromatosis-related arthropathy. The elevated transferrin saturation and serum ferritin levels further support iron overload. In hereditary hemochromatosis, iron deposition can lead to several complications, including diabetes mellitus (as seen in this patient), liver cirrhosis, skin pigmentation, and endocrine abnormalities such as hypogonadism. Hypogonadism occurs due to iron deposition in the pituitary gland, affecting hormone production. Other options like hepatic adenoma, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and hepatic steatosis are not typical complications of hemochromatosis. Therefore, the patient is at risk of hypogonadism.",9
2839,"The patient's symptoms include increased urinary frequency, urgency, lower back pain, subjective warmth (suggesting fever), and a tender prostate on examination. These symptoms are consistent with acute prostatitis. The most common cause of acute prostatitis in men, especially in this age group, is a bacterial infection, typically with gram-negative organisms such as Escherichia coli. The history of a past chlamydial infection is not relevant to the current presentation, as Chlamydia trachomatis is not a common cause of acute prostatitis in older men. Prostatic adenocarcinoma typically presents with different symptoms and is not associated with acute tenderness or fever. Chemical irritation is less likely given the acute presentation and systemic symptoms. Therefore, the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms is an infection with Escherichia coli.",9
2798,,0
2810,,0
2883,"The patient is likely suffering from Wernicke's encephalopathy, which is characterized by confusion, ataxia, and nystagmus. This condition is caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, often seen in alcoholics or malnourished individuals. The decreased erythrocyte transketolase activity supports thiamine deficiency. Administering glucose without prior thiamine supplementation can precipitate or worsen Wernicke's encephalopathy because glucose metabolism requires thiamine as a cofactor. Therefore, the administration of glucose likely caused the patient's current condition.",9
2928,"The patient presents with symptoms that are classic for fat embolism syndrome, which typically occurs after long bone fractures. The key features include respiratory distress, neurological symptoms, and a petechial rash. The sudden onset of severe dyspnea following the surgery for femur and tibia fractures, along with the petechial rash, strongly suggests fat embolism. This condition is caused by fat globules entering the bloodstream and lodging in the pulmonary capillaries, leading to respiratory distress. The other options are less likely given the clinical presentation: pulmonary edema would not typically present with a petechial rash; cardiac tamponade would present with hypotension, distended neck veins, and muffled heart sounds; bacterial pneumonia would not develop so acutely post-surgery and would not cause a petechial rash.",9
2910,"The patient presents with signs consistent with chronic liver disease, such as jaundice and abdominal varices, which suggest portal hypertension. The vomiting of blood (hematemesis) and the presence of tortuous veins (caput medusae) are indicative of esophageal varices, which are dilated veins in the esophagus due to increased pressure in the portal venous system. This increased pressure is often due to cirrhosis, which leads to increased pressure in the left gastric vein and subsequently the distal esophageal vein. The sudden massive hematemesis and hypotension are consistent with a rupture of these varices, leading to hemorrhagic shock. Therefore, the most likely cause of his vomiting of blood is increased pressure in the distal esophageal vein due to increased pressure in the left gastric vein, which is a result of portal hypertension.",9
2930,"The clinical presentation of this 5-month-old boy suggests an immunodeficiency disorder. The key findings include recurrent respiratory infections, poor weight gain, and a specific type of pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii, as indicated by the methenamine silver staining showing cysts with central spores. Additionally, the patient has decreased serum IgA levels.

These findings are characteristic of Hyper-IgM syndrome, which is caused by a defect in the CD40 ligand. This defect leads to an inability of B cells to class switch from IgM to other immunoglobulin types, resulting in normal or elevated IgM levels but decreased levels of other immunoglobulins like IgA and IgG. The recurrent infections and poor weight gain are due to the immunodeficiency caused by this defect.

Other options can be ruled out based on the specific findings:
- A defective WAS gene (option A) would lead to Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, which presents with eczema, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent infections, but not specifically with the findings in this case.
- A tyrosine kinase gene mutation (option C) is associated with X-linked agammaglobulinemia, which typically presents with very low levels of all immunoglobulins and absence of B cells, not just decreased IgA.
- Impaired NADPH oxidase (option D) leads to chronic granulomatous disease, characterized by recurrent bacterial and fungal infections due to defective phagocyte function, not the specific immunoglobulin pattern seen here.

Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is a defective CD40 ligand.",9
2950,"The patient is on long-term anticoagulation, likely with warfarin, given the context of a deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Warfarin works by inhibiting vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, which include factors II, VII, IX, and X. The prothrombin time (PT) is prolonged, indicating that the extrinsic pathway is affected, which is consistent with warfarin therapy. Factor VII is the first factor in the extrinsic pathway and is the one initially affected by warfarin, leading to an increase in PT. Therefore, the factor initially activated in the target pathway for her long-term treatment is factor VII.",9
2932,"The patient is showing signs of abdominal compartment syndrome, which is characterized by increased intra-abdominal pressure leading to compromised organ function. The elevated central venous pressure, jugular venous distention, hypotension, tachycardia, oliguria, and tense, distended abdomen are indicative of this condition. The elevated urea nitrogen and creatinine levels suggest acute kidney injury, likely due to decreased renal perfusion from the increased intra-abdominal pressure. The most appropriate management for abdominal compartment syndrome is surgical decompression, which involves reopening the abdomen to relieve the pressure.",9
2967,"The ability of an infant to lift their head and visually track objects or people is a developmental milestone. By 2 months of age, infants typically begin to have better head control and can lift their head when lying on their stomach. They also start to visually track objects and people. This is consistent with the observation of the child looking at the physician with their head lifted upwards. Therefore, this behavior is commonly observed around 2 months of age in a developmentally normal child.",9
2970,"The biopsy findings describe cells with an increased nuclear: cytoplasmic ratio and marked hyperchromatism involving the full thickness of the epithelium, but above the basement membrane. This indicates that the abnormal cells are present throughout the entire thickness of the epithelium, which is characteristic of carcinoma in situ. Carcinoma in situ is a form of cancer where the malignant cells have not yet invaded beyond the basement membrane. Reactive atypia would not involve the full thickness of the epithelium with such marked changes. Microinvasion would involve penetration beyond the basement membrane, which is not described here. Urothelial metaplasia refers to a change in cell type, not the dysplastic changes described. Therefore, the best description of the biopsy findings is urothelial carcinoma-in-situ.",9
2988,"The clinical presentation of the 10-month-old boy is consistent with a viral respiratory infection, likely bronchiolitis, given the age, symptoms of rhinorrhea, cough, and wheezing. The child is alert, well-appearing, and has normal vital signs except for a mild fever. The history of previous infections is not unusual for a child of this age. The chest x-ray is not described, but given the context, it likely does not show any acute abnormalities that would suggest bacterial pneumonia or other serious conditions. 

The management of bronchiolitis in a well-appearing child typically involves supportive care, such as hydration and antipyretics, rather than further diagnostic testing or imaging. 

- Option A (Provide reassurance) is appropriate as the child is well-appearing and the condition is self-limiting.
- Option B (Perform PPD skin testing) is not indicated as there is no suspicion of tuberculosis.
- Option C (Obtain a thoracic CT scan) is unnecessary and not indicated in a stable child with suspected bronchiolitis.
- Option D (Measure T cell count) is not relevant to the current clinical scenario.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to provide reassurance to the parents.",9
3012,"The patient has mild persistent asthma and is currently on fluticasone, an inhaled corticosteroid, but is using his albuterol inhaler daily, indicating that his asthma is not well-controlled. According to asthma management guidelines, if a patient on low-dose inhaled corticosteroids is not well-controlled, the next step is to add a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) such as salmeterol. This combination can help improve asthma control by providing both anti-inflammatory effects and bronchodilation. Discontinuing fluticasone or adding cromolyn or ipratropium would not be appropriate as they do not address the need for better control of persistent symptoms.",9
2980,"The patient is a 17-year-old who is sexually active and requests oral contraceptive pills. In most states, minors can consent to contraceptive services without parental consent. Therefore, contacting the parents is not necessary. Given her sexual activity with multiple partners, it is prudent to recommend screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) as part of comprehensive sexual health care. Providing the requested prescription for oral contraceptives is appropriate after confirming the negative pregnancy test. A urine drug screen is not indicated based on the information provided. Advising against oral contraceptives and recommending only condom use does not address her request or provide comprehensive care. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to recommend STI screening and provide the prescription.",9
3041,"The patient has a suprasellar cystic mass compressing the infundibular stalk. This is suggestive of a craniopharyngioma, which can affect the pituitary stalk. Compression of the pituitary stalk can lead to disruption of the normal inhibitory control of prolactin secretion by dopamine from the hypothalamus. Normally, dopamine inhibits prolactin secretion. When the stalk is compressed, this inhibition is reduced, leading to increased levels of prolactin. Other hormones like luteinizing hormone, somatotropin (growth hormone), and vasopressin are not directly affected by stalk compression in the same way as prolactin.",9
3062,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), including lower abdominal pain, fever, cervical motion tenderness, and purulent vaginal discharge. The laboratory findings show leukocytosis and elevated ESR, supporting an inflammatory process. The negative urine nitrite and low WBC in urine suggest that a urinary tract infection is not the primary issue. PID is often caused by sexually transmitted infections, commonly Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. The recommended treatment for PID includes coverage for both of these organisms. Intramuscular ceftriaxone provides coverage for gonorrhea, and oral doxycycline covers chlamydia. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline.",9
3074,"The patient is exhibiting signs of acute confusion and agitation, which are characteristic of delirium. Delirium in a post-operative setting can be caused by several factors:

A. Infection: Post-operative infections, such as urinary tract infections (especially with an indwelling catheter), can lead to delirium.

B. Polypharmacy: The use of multiple medications, including opioids for pain management, can contribute to delirium due to drug interactions or side effects.

C. Amyloid accumulation: This is associated with Alzheimer's disease, which is a chronic condition leading to dementia, not an acute change like delirium. The patient's acute presentation and lack of prior cognitive issues make this an unlikely cause.

D. Electrolyte abnormalities: Post-operative patients can experience electrolyte imbalances, which can lead to delirium.

Given the acute nature of the patient's symptoms and the context, amyloid accumulation is the least likely contributor to her current presentation.",9
3072,"The patient presents with new onset shortness of breath and hypoxemia following a recent ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The presence of a holosystolic murmur radiating to the axilla and an S3 heart sound, along with bilateral crackles, suggests acute heart failure and possibly mitral regurgitation. In the context of a recent myocardial infarction, papillary muscle rupture is a known complication that can lead to acute mitral regurgitation. This condition would cause a holosystolic murmur due to the regurgitant flow from the left ventricle to the left atrium during systole. The S3 heart sound and crackles indicate volume overload and pulmonary congestion, consistent with acute heart failure due to severe mitral regurgitation. Other options like Dressler syndrome, free wall rupture, and interventricular septum rupture do not fit the clinical presentation as well as papillary muscle rupture does. Dressler syndrome typically presents weeks after an MI with pericarditis symptoms, free wall rupture would likely lead to cardiac tamponade and hemodynamic instability, and interventricular septum rupture would present with a murmur best heard at the left sternal border and signs of right heart failure.",9
3077,"The clinical presentation suggests placental abruption, characterized by vaginal bleeding, uterine tenderness, and hypertonic contractions. The patient is at 35 weeks' gestation, and the fetal heart rate is reassuring. In cases of placental abruption with a stable mother and fetus, the goal is to expedite delivery if the gestational age is sufficient and the fetal status is stable. Since the fetus is in cephalic presentation and the mother is having regular contractions, vaginal delivery is appropriate. There is no indication for cesarean delivery as the fetal heart rate is stable, and the mother is not in distress. Betamethasone is not needed as the fetus is beyond 34 weeks, and terbutaline is contraindicated in placental abruption due to the risk of worsening bleeding.",9
3112,"The clinical presentation of progressive memory loss, disorientation, and eventual severe cognitive decline in an elderly patient is highly suggestive of Alzheimer's disease. The key histological features of Alzheimer's disease include the presence of Aβ amyloid neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Among the options provided, Aβ amyloid neuritic plaques are the characteristic histological finding that confirms the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. 

Option B, ubiquitinated TDP-43, is associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, not Alzheimer's disease. 

Option C, beta-pleated sheet proteins resistant to proteases, refers to prion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. 

Option D, viral inclusions within oligodendrocytes, is related to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a demyelinating disease caused by the JC virus.

Therefore, the histological feature that confirms the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in this patient is Aβ amyloid neuritic plaques.",9
3136,"The patient is experiencing intermittent claudication, which is characterized by pain in the legs due to inadequate blood flow during exercise, typically caused by peripheral artery disease (PAD). The diminished popliteal artery pulse on the right side supports this diagnosis. Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that has vasodilatory effects and inhibits platelet aggregation, which can improve symptoms of intermittent claudication by increasing blood flow to the affected limbs. Acetaminophen is an analgesic and antipyretic, not effective for claudication. Isosorbide dinitrate is used for angina, not claudication. Ranolazine is used for chronic angina, not for PAD. Therefore, cilostazol is the most appropriate choice to improve this patient's symptoms.",9
3170,"The symptoms and findings described in the question are characteristic of an Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm) infection. The key features include itching of the vulva and anal region, especially at night, and the presence of ova on adhesive tape applied to the perianal area. The most appropriate treatment for pinworm infection is an antihelminthic medication. Mebendazole is commonly used to treat pinworm infections. Melarsoprol is used for African trypanosomiasis, diethylcarbamazine is used for filariasis, and praziquantel is used for schistosomiasis and other trematode infections. Therefore, the correct treatment for this patient is mebendazole.",9
3164,"The clinical presentation suggests a possible case of cat scratch disease, which is caused by Bartonella henselae. This condition is characterized by regional lymphadenopathy, often in the axillary region, following a scratch or bite from a cat. The presence of a separate lesion on the forearm that appears inflamed but is painless could be the site of inoculation. Given these findings, it is important to inquire about contact with pets, particularly cats, to support the diagnosis of cat scratch disease.",9
3202,"Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is primarily mediated by the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), which is located in the area postrema of the medulla oblongata. The CTZ detects emetogenic substances in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid and communicates with the vomiting center to induce nausea and vomiting. The other options listed do not play a direct role in the emetic pathway. The medial geniculate nucleus is involved in auditory processing, the posterior hypothalamus is involved in autonomic and endocrine functions, and the ventral posterolateral nucleus is involved in somatosensory processing.",9
3218,"The symptoms described in the vignette are characteristic of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), a group of connective tissue disorders. The key features include easy bruising, skin hyperextensibility, and joint hypermobility. The specific type of EDS that presents with these symptoms, particularly the skin hyperextensibility and joint hypermobility, is often associated with defects in type V collagen. Type V collagen is crucial for the structural integrity of connective tissues, and its defect leads to the classic presentation of EDS. Type III collagen defects are more associated with vascular EDS, which presents with more severe vascular complications. Type I collagen defects are associated with osteogenesis imperfecta, which presents with brittle bones rather than the skin and joint symptoms described here. Impaired copper absorption is related to Menkes disease, which presents differently. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is defective type V collagen.",9
3161,"The patient is a 7-year-old girl with signs of precocious puberty, including vaginal bleeding, breast development, and pubic hair growth. Her bone age is advanced at 11 years, indicating early maturation. Her serum luteinizing hormone (LH) level is low, which suggests that the precocious puberty may not be centrally mediated (i.e., not due to early activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis). In cases of peripheral precocious puberty, the LH level remains low because the source of sex steroids is outside the pituitary control. A GnRH stimulation test can help differentiate between central (gonadotropin-dependent) and peripheral (gonadotropin-independent) precocious puberty. In central precocious puberty, LH levels will rise significantly after GnRH stimulation, whereas in peripheral precocious puberty, LH levels will remain low. Thus, the most appropriate next step is to perform a GnRH stimulation test to further evaluate the cause of the precocious puberty.",9
3245,"The drug follows first-order kinetics, meaning the rate of elimination is proportional to the drug concentration. The half-life (t1/2) can be determined from the initial concentration (60 U/L) and the concentration after 3 hours (30 U/L). Since the concentration halves from 60 U/L to 30 U/L in 3 hours, the half-life is 3 hours.

To find the concentration 9 hours after administration, we calculate how many half-lives have passed in 9 hours:

- 9 hours / 3 hours per half-life = 3 half-lives.

Starting from 60 U/L:
- After 1 half-life (3 hours): 30 U/L
- After 2 half-lives (6 hours): 15 U/L
- After 3 half-lives (9 hours): 7.5 U/L

Thus, the concentration after 9 hours is 7.5 U/L.",10
3222,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of Marfan syndrome, characterized by tall stature, lens dislocation, scoliosis, and cardiovascular abnormalities. The early diastolic murmur along the left sternal border indicates aortic regurgitation, which is common in Marfan syndrome due to aortic root dilation. Aortic regurgitation leads to a wide pulse pressure, as seen in this patient (140/50 mm Hg), and is associated with a bounding pulse known as a water hammer pulse. This is due to the rapid rise and fall of the pulse pressure. Therefore, the further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show a water hammer pulse.",9
3289,"The patient presents with normocytic anemia (hemoglobin 9 g/dL, hematocrit 29%, MCV 90 µm^3) and hypercalcemia (serum calcium 11.8 mg/dL). Normocytic anemia can be caused by chronic disease, bone marrow disorders, or acute blood loss. However, the significant weight loss and hypercalcemia are key clues. Hypercalcemia in the context of anemia and weight loss is often associated with malignancy, particularly multiple myeloma or other cancers that cause paraneoplastic hypercalcemia. Bone marrow aplasia would typically present with pancytopenia, not just anemia. Intravascular hemolysis would show signs like elevated LDH, low haptoglobin, and increased bilirubin, which are not provided here. Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency would cause macrocytic anemia, not normocytic. Therefore, the combination of symptoms and lab findings most strongly suggests a malignancy.",9
3278,"In the lymph node, B cell proliferation and differentiation primarily occur in the germinal centers of the lymphoid follicles. These germinal centers are located in the cortex of the lymph node. The cortex is the outer region of the lymph node, and it contains the follicles where B cells are activated and undergo proliferation and differentiation. In the context of the lymph node structure, the germinal centers are typically found in the secondary follicles of the cortex. Based on the typical numbering of lymph node sections, the cortex is often labeled as section 3.",9
3305,"The patient presents with headaches, visual disturbances (double vision and impaired peripheral vision), and an intrasellar mass on MRI. These symptoms are suggestive of a pituitary adenoma. The location and size of the mass, along with the symptoms, suggest a non-functioning or possibly a prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma (prolactinoma). Prolactinomas are the most common type of pituitary adenoma and can cause symptoms such as galactorrhea and hypogonadism, leading to erectile dysfunction in men. The absence of symptoms like temperature intolerance or weight changes makes thyroid or adrenal hormone-secreting tumors less likely. The most likely finding in this scenario, given the commonality of prolactinomas and the symptoms, is erectile dysfunction due to hyperprolactinemia.",9
3317,"The patient's symptoms and findings suggest a diagnosis of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2). This is supported by the presence of a pheochromocytoma (indicated by paroxysms of headaches, elevated blood pressure, palpitations, and elevated plasma-free metanephrines) and a medullary thyroid carcinoma (indicated by the thyroid nodule staining positive for calcitonin). The family history of thyroid cancer further supports this diagnosis. MEN 2 is known to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.",9
3313,"Metoprolol is a selective ß1 receptor antagonist. In the kidneys, ß1 receptors are present on juxtaglomerular cells, which are responsible for the secretion of renin. By blocking these ß1 receptors, metoprolol reduces the secretion of renin. Therefore, the expected effect of metoprolol is a decrease in serum renin levels due to ß1 receptor antagonism.",9
3365,"The patient presents with symptoms and lab findings suggestive of salicylate (aspirin) overdose. Initial ABG shows a primary respiratory alkalosis (high pH, low pCO2) due to hyperventilation, which is common in early salicylate toxicity. The repeat ABG shows a mixed acid-base disorder with metabolic acidosis (low pH, low HCO3-) and a compensatory respiratory alkalosis (low pCO2). The symptoms of tinnitus and agitation further support salicylate toxicity. The best management step for salicylate overdose is to alkalinize the urine to enhance salicylate excretion. This is achieved by administering IV sodium bicarbonate, which will help correct the metabolic acidosis and promote renal excretion of salicylates.",9
3359,"The patient's symptoms and findings suggest a condition characterized by skin hyperpigmentation, diabetes, and heart issues. The combination of these symptoms is classic for hemochromatosis, a condition where there is increased intestinal absorption of iron leading to iron overload. This iron deposition can cause skin hyperpigmentation (bronze diabetes), diabetes mellitus due to pancreatic damage, and cardiac issues such as restrictive cardiomyopathy, which is consistent with the echocardiogram findings of reduced filling despite a normal ejection fraction. The extra heart sound before S1 (S4 gallop) and the symptoms of heart failure (fatigue, dyspnea, edema) further support this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely explanation for this patient's condition is increased intestinal absorption of iron.",9
3472,"The patient is experiencing symptoms of sadness, crying, changes in sleep and appetite, and social withdrawal following a significant life stressor (loss of her job). These symptoms have been present for about a month. She still engages in some activities, such as attending a book club and planning a family reunion, which suggests that her functioning is not severely impaired. The timeline and context of her symptoms align with an adjustment disorder, which is characterized by emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor occurring within 3 months of the onset of the stressor. Dysthymic disorder (persistent depressive disorder) requires symptoms for at least 2 years, which is not the case here. Substance use disorder would require a pattern of substance use leading to significant impairment or distress, which is not clearly indicated. Bipolar disorder involves episodes of mania or hypomania, which are not present in this case.",9
3498,"The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings suggest a rotator cuff injury, likely involving the supraspinatus muscle, given the pain and weakness with abduction and external rotation. The subacromial tenderness also supports this. While physical exam and history are crucial for initial assessment, imaging is often used to confirm the diagnosis. MRI is the most definitive imaging modality for visualizing soft tissue injuries like rotator cuff tears, as it provides detailed images of the tendons and muscles. Ultrasound can also be used to assess rotator cuff injuries, but MRI is generally considered the gold standard for confirmation.",9
3511,"The patient's symptoms of pounding headache, dizziness, blurring of vision, palpitations, and severe hypertension suggest a catecholamine-secreting tumor, such as a pheochromocytoma. The episodic nature of the symptoms, along with the severe hypertension and palpitations, are classic for pheochromocytoma. The family history of renal cancer could suggest a genetic syndrome, but the symptoms align more closely with pheochromocytoma. Imaging would likely reveal an adrenal medullary mass, which is characteristic of pheochromocytoma.",9
3501,"The patient's symptoms and PFT results suggest an obstructive lung disease, as indicated by the decreased FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio. The increased TLC suggests hyperinflation, which is common in obstructive diseases. The fact that the patient does not smoke and is relatively young points away from typical emphysema due to smoking. Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic condition that can cause early-onset emphysema, particularly in the lower lobes, and is consistent with the patient's age and non-smoking status. Chronic bronchitis is typically associated with smoking and would not usually present with increased TLC. Asthma could present similarly but is less likely to cause increased TLC to the same extent as emphysema. Pneumothorax would not cause these PFT changes.",9
3514,"The clinical presentation of the newborn suggests a genetic syndrome characterized by specific facial features, poor muscle tone, and a high-pitched cry. The combination of these features, particularly the high-pitched cry, is highly suggestive of Cri du chat syndrome. Cri du chat syndrome is caused by a deletion on the short arm of chromosome 5 (5p). The characteristic high-pitched cry, which resembles the cry of a cat, along with the facial features and developmental delays, aligns with this diagnosis.",9
3525,"The patient's symptoms of blurry vision, difficulty walking, fatigue that improves with rest, and bilateral ptosis suggest a neuromuscular junction disorder, specifically myasthenia gravis (MG). MG is characterized by autoantibodies against the acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle weakness that worsens with activity and improves with rest. The appropriate treatment for MG involves increasing the availability of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction to improve muscle contraction. This can be achieved by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine, thereby increasing its concentration and duration of action at the neuromuscular junction. Therefore, the most appropriate drug mechanism is inhibition of acetylcholinesterase.",9

3528,"The patient has a history of a molar pregnancy, as indicated by the presence of hyperplastic and hydropic trophoblastic villi without fetal tissue. The significantly elevated beta-hCG level, which has increased from 63,200 mIU/mL to 101,005 mIU/mL over two weeks, suggests persistent gestational trophoblastic disease. The bilateral adnexal masses with multiple thin-walled cysts seen on ultrasound are characteristic of theca lutein cysts. These cysts are associated with high levels of beta-hCG, as seen in molar pregnancies, and are typically bilateral and multilocular. The other options are less likely: corpus luteal cysts are usually unilateral and related to normal ovulation, ectopic pregnancy would not cause such high beta-hCG levels or bilateral cysts, and endometriomas are associated with endometriosis and have a different ultrasound appearance.",9
3580,"The patient presents with signs of respiratory distress, decreased breath sounds, and dullness on percussion on the right side, suggesting a possible hemothorax or pneumothorax. The presence of crepitation and a crunching sound synchronous with the heartbeat (Hamman's sign) is indicative of pneumomediastinum, which is often associated with tracheobronchial injury. The arterial blood gas analysis shows respiratory acidosis with hypoxemia, consistent with impaired ventilation. Given the mechanism of injury (high-speed collision) and the clinical findings, bronchial rupture is the most likely diagnosis.",9
3582,"The clinical presentation of recurrent bacterial infections, particularly with encapsulated organisms like pneumococcus, along with undetectable serum immunoglobulins and reduced B cells, suggests a defect in B cell development or function. The family history of affected male relatives suggests an X-linked pattern of inheritance. Bruton agammaglobulinemia, also known as X-linked agammaglobulinemia, is characterized by a mutation in the BTK gene, leading to a failure in B cell maturation and resulting in low or absent B cells and immunoglobulins. This fits the clinical and laboratory findings in this patient. Common variable immunodeficiency typically presents later in life and is not X-linked. DiGeorge syndrome involves T cell deficiency due to thymic hypoplasia, not B cell deficiency. Hereditary angioedema is unrelated to immunoglobulin levels or B cell counts.",9
3583,"The patient presents with symptoms and a family history suggestive of a genetic condition affecting the lungs. He has been treated for asthma, but his symptoms have progressed, which is unusual for well-managed asthma. The family history of early-onset COPD in non-smokers (father and uncle) suggests a hereditary condition. The presence of clubbing, bilateral crackles, and mild hepatomegaly are also notable. These findings, along with the prolonged expiratory phase, point towards emphysema, which can be caused by α1-antitrypsin deficiency, a genetic disorder. This condition can lead to early-onset emphysema, especially in non-smokers, and can also cause liver problems, explaining the hepatomegaly.",9
3606,"The patient is a 68-year-old man with a 4 cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm identified on screening ultrasound. He has a significant smoking history and mild hypertension, but is otherwise in good health. The management of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) depends on the size of the aneurysm and the presence of symptoms. For asymptomatic AAAs, the general guideline is:

- Surveillance for aneurysms less than 5.5 cm in diameter.
- Consideration of repair for aneurysms 5.5 cm or larger, or if they are rapidly expanding or symptomatic.

In this case, the aneurysm is 4 cm, which is below the threshold for surgical intervention. Therefore, the best initial step is surveillance, which involves regular follow-up imaging to monitor the size of the aneurysm. Beta-blockers are not indicated specifically for aneurysm management unless there is another cardiovascular indication. Urgent repair is not necessary for an aneurysm of this size, and reassurance alone is not sufficient as the aneurysm needs to be monitored over time.",9
3591,"Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic used for treatment-resistant schizophrenia and sometimes in bipolar disorder with psychotic features. A significant risk associated with clozapine is agranulocytosis, a potentially life-threatening decrease in white blood cells. To monitor for this, patients on clozapine require regular complete blood count (CBC) tests to ensure their white blood cell count remains within a safe range. Initially, this monitoring is done weekly for the first six months of treatment.",9
3765,"The patient presents with hematochezia (bright red blood in the stool) and weight loss, which raises concern for a possible lower gastrointestinal source of bleeding, such as colorectal cancer or polyps. Given the patient's age and symptoms, a colonoscopy is the most appropriate next step. Colonoscopy allows for direct visualization of the entire colon and can help identify potential sources of bleeding, such as tumors, polyps, or other lesions. While a complete blood count could provide information on anemia, it does not help identify the source of bleeding. A barium enema is less commonly used now due to the availability of colonoscopy. Anoscopy is limited to examining the anal canal and lower rectum, which may miss more proximal lesions. Therefore, colonoscopy is the best choice for a comprehensive evaluation.",9
8573,"The patient is showing signs of anaphylaxis, which include shortness of breath, wheezing, urticaria, lip swelling, and hypotension. Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction that requires immediate treatment. The first-line treatment for anaphylaxis is intramuscular epinephrine, which helps to counteract the symptoms by causing vasoconstriction, bronchodilation, and reducing vascular permeability. While diphenhydramine can be used to treat allergic reactions, it is not the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. Vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam are antibiotics and not relevant to treating anaphylaxis. Endotracheal intubation may be necessary if there is airway compromise, but the immediate step is to administer epinephrine to stabilize the patient.",9
8438,"The patient presents with a testicular mass, gynecomastia, and elevated levels of both HCG and AFP. These findings are suggestive of a non-seminomatous germ cell tumor. Seminomas typically do not produce AFP, so the presence of elevated AFP rules out a pure seminoma. Leydig cell tumors can cause gynecomastia due to hormone production but do not typically elevate AFP or HCG. Metastasis to the testis is rare and would not typically present with these specific tumor marker elevations. Embryonal carcinoma, a type of non-seminomatous germ cell tumor, can produce both HCG and AFP, making it the most likely diagnosis given the laboratory findings and clinical presentation.",9
8651,"Changing the cut-off for a positive PPD from 10 mm to 5 mm means that more people will be classified as having a positive test result. This increases the sensitivity of the test because it will identify more true positive cases. However, increasing sensitivity typically comes at the cost of decreasing specificity, as more false positives are likely to occur. With more false positives, the positive predictive value (PPV) of the test decreases because PPV is the proportion of true positive results in all positive results. Therefore, the correct statement regarding this change is that it will decrease the positive predictive value of the test.",9
8809,"In patients using opioids for pain management, tolerance can develop to many of the side effects, such as nausea, pruritus, and respiratory depression. However, tolerance to constipation does not typically develop. This is because the gastrointestinal tract's response to opioids does not adapt in the same way as other systems. Therefore, even with dose escalation, constipation remains a persistent side effect that does not improve with continued opioid use.",9
8872,"The patient has a written advance directive that clearly states his wishes not to be resuscitated or placed on life support. Advance directives are legal documents that express a patient's preferences regarding medical treatment in situations where they are unable to communicate their decisions. These directives take precedence over the wishes of family members, including the spouse, unless there is evidence that the directive is invalid or has been revoked. In this case, the patient's wife wants resuscitation, but the advance directive must be honored as it reflects the patient's autonomous decision. Therefore, the appropriate course of action is to respect the patient's advance directive orders.",9
8832,"In the thymus, T cell development involves several stages. Initially, T cell precursors enter the thymus and become double-negative (lacking both CD4 and CD8). As they progress, they become double-positive (expressing both CD4 and CD8) in the cortex of the thymus. During positive selection, these double-positive T cells interact with cortical epithelial cells expressing MHC molecules. If they successfully bind, they survive; if not, they undergo apoptosis. This process ensures that T cells can recognize self-MHC. Therefore, during this phase, the T cells are CD4+ and CD8+.",9
8914,"During pregnancy, the demand for thyroid hormones increases due to increased levels of thyroid-binding globulin and the need to supply thyroid hormone to the developing fetus. Women with hypothyroidism who are on levothyroxine often require an increase in their dose to maintain euthyroid status. It is generally recommended to increase the dose of levothyroxine by 30% as soon as pregnancy is confirmed. This helps to ensure adequate thyroid hormone levels for both the mother and the developing fetus.",9
8783,"The patient has a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) as indicated by the noncompressible popliteal vein on ultrasound. The drug prescribed is likely an anticoagulant. The laboratory results show a normal thrombin time, which suggests that direct thrombin inhibitors like dabigatran or drugs affecting thrombin directly are not involved. The partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is slightly elevated, and the prothrombin time (PT) is also elevated, which is consistent with the use of a direct factor Xa inhibitor like apixaban. Unfractionated heparin would typically cause a more significant increase in PTT and might affect thrombin time. Low molecular weight heparin primarily affects factor Xa and would not typically cause significant changes in PT or PTT. Alteplase is a thrombolytic and would not be used for routine anticoagulation. Therefore, the drug most likely prescribed is apixaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor, which would explain the laboratory findings.",9
8952,"The patient's symptoms and history are suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). She has a malar rash, joint pain, pleuritic chest pain, hematuria, and a history of miscarriages, all of which are consistent with SLE. In SLE, complement levels (C3 and C4) are often low due to consumption by immune complexes. Anti-histone antibodies are more specific for drug-induced lupus, which is less likely given the systemic nature of her symptoms and the presence of a malar rash. Joint erosions are more characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis, and cytotoxic glomerular antibodies are not typically associated with SLE. Therefore, low serum levels of C3 and C4 are the most likely finding in this patient.",9
8962,"The patient presents with a painful genital ulcer that is draining purulent material, along with tender inguinal lymphadenopathy. These symptoms are indicative of a sexually transmitted infection. The key features to note are the painful ulcer and the purulent discharge.

- **Chlamydia trachomatis**: This organism can cause lymphogranuloma venereum, which typically presents with painless ulcers and painful lymphadenopathy, not purulent discharge.

- **Klebsiella granulomatis**: Causes granuloma inguinale (donovanosis), which presents with painless, beefy-red ulcers that bleed easily, not painful ulcers with purulent discharge.

- **Herpes simplex virus 2**: Causes painful vesicular lesions that can ulcerate, but these are not typically associated with purulent discharge.

- **Haemophilus ducreyi**: Causes chancroid, which is characterized by painful genital ulcers and tender suppurative inguinal lymphadenopathy. The ulcers are often described as having a necrotic base and can produce purulent discharge.

Given the presentation of a painful ulcer with purulent discharge and tender lymphadenopathy, the most likely causal organism is Haemophilus ducreyi, which causes chancroid.",9
9111,"The analysis strategy described is known as an ""intention-to-treat"" (ITT) analysis. In an ITT analysis, all participants are analyzed in the groups to which they were originally assigned, regardless of whether they adhered to the treatment protocol. This approach is used to preserve the benefits of randomization and to provide an unbiased estimate of treatment effect. By including all participants as originally assigned, ITT analysis helps to maintain the comparability of groups and prevents bias that could arise from differential dropout or non-adherence. This strategy is primarily aimed at reducing selection bias, as it ensures that the groups remain comparable and that the results reflect the effect of assigning the treatment rather than the effect of receiving the treatment. Therefore, the best answer is that this strategy is used to reduce selection bias.",9
9127,"The patient is experiencing depressive symptoms and erectile dysfunction, likely as a side effect of sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). When considering a switch in antidepressant medication, it's important to choose one that is less likely to cause sexual side effects. Bupropion is an antidepressant that works as a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) and is known for having a lower incidence of sexual side effects compared to SSRIs. Additionally, bupropion can be effective in treating depressive symptoms. Nortriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, and fluoxetine, another SSRI, are more likely to cause sexual side effects. Buspirone is primarily used for anxiety and is not typically used as a primary treatment for depression. Therefore, bupropion is the most appropriate choice for this patient.",9
9138,"The clinical presentation of the 5-year-old girl suggests pertussis (whooping cough), characterized by violent coughing spells followed by a high-pitched inspiratory ""whoop."" The conjunctival hemorrhage and petechiae are likely due to the intense coughing. The child has not been fully vaccinated, which increases the likelihood of pertussis. The most appropriate treatment for pertussis in children is a macrolide antibiotic, such as azithromycin, to reduce transmission and severity. Topical treatments or artificial tears would not address the underlying infection. Therefore, oral azithromycin is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy.",9
9174,"The patient presents with painful menses (dysmenorrhea) that occurs during the first two days of her menstrual period. Her symptoms are relieved by ibuprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which suggests that the pain is likely due to prostaglandin-mediated processes. Primary dysmenorrhea is caused by increased production of prostaglandins in the endometrium, leading to uterine contractions and pain. The absence of other symptoms such as dyspareunia or irregular menses, and the normal pelvic examination, make secondary causes like endometriosis or adenomyosis less likely. Therefore, the underlying cause of her pain is most consistent with prostaglandin-induced myometrial contraction.",9
9134,"The patient is a 25-year-old pregnant woman at 28 weeks gestation presenting with a headache, elevated blood pressure (164/104 mmHg), and proteinuria. Her platelet count is low at 100,500/mm^3, which is below the normal range. These findings are consistent with preeclampsia, which is characterized by hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation. The presence of a headache and low platelet count suggests a more severe form of preeclampsia. However, there is no mention of seizures, which would indicate eclampsia. The liver function tests (AST and ALT) are normal, which makes acute fatty liver disease of pregnancy less likely. Given the elevated blood pressure, proteinuria, and low platelet count, the most likely diagnosis is severe preeclampsia.",9
9175,"The patient's symptoms and the presence of a small, firm mass in the right upper quadrant suggest a gallbladder issue. The CT scan likely shows a gallbladder abnormality, possibly a porcelain gallbladder, which is a calcified gallbladder wall. Porcelain gallbladder is associated with chronic inflammation and is a risk factor for gallbladder adenocarcinoma. The other options, such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and acute pancreatitis, are not directly related to the findings described in this scenario. Therefore, the condition that this patient is at increased risk for is gallbladder adenocarcinoma.",9
9181,"The patient has a history of asthma and is experiencing increased frequency of symptoms, particularly nocturnal cough and daily use of his rescue inhaler. This suggests that his asthma is not well-controlled. The presence of end-expiratory wheezing and a PEFR of 74% indicates moderate persistent asthma. The standard treatment for persistent asthma includes the use of a daily inhaled corticosteroid to reduce inflammation and prevent symptoms. Inhaled albuterol is a short-acting beta-agonist used for quick relief, not for long-term control. Ipratropium bromide is not typically used for asthma management, and levocetirizine is an antihistamine used for allergic symptoms, which the patient does not have. Therefore, the best next step is to add a daily inhaled corticosteroid to his regimen to achieve better asthma control.",9
9180,"The patient presents with symptoms and ultrasound findings consistent with acute cholecystitis, likely due to a gallstone obstructing the neck of the gallbladder. The presence of fever, leukocytosis, and ultrasound findings such as gallbladder wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, and sloughing of the intraluminal membrane indicate inflammation and possible infection. The common bile duct is unremarkable, suggesting no choledocholithiasis. In cases of acute cholecystitis, the initial management includes supportive care with intravenous fluids, pain control, and antibiotic therapy to address potential infection. Emergent surgery is not typically the first step unless there is evidence of complications such as perforation or gangrene. Elective cholecystectomy is considered after the acute episode resolves. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to start antibiotic therapy to manage the infection.",9
9191,"The patient has a documented living will that explicitly states he refuses intubation under any circumstance. This is a legally binding document that outlines the patient's wishes regarding medical treatment. Even though the family is requesting intubation, the living will takes precedence over the family's wishes. The patient's autonomy and previously expressed wishes must be respected, especially since the living will is clear and specific about refusing intubation. Therefore, the best course of action is to follow the living will and not intubate the patient.",9
9227,"The patient's symptoms and lab findings suggest a gastrointestinal issue. The abdominal pain occurring 2-3 hours after meals, especially at night, is characteristic of a duodenal peptic ulcer. The pain pattern is typical for duodenal ulcers, which often cause pain when the stomach is empty, such as at night. The patient's fatigue and conjunctival pallor, along with low hemoglobin, suggest anemia, which can be due to chronic blood loss from a peptic ulcer. The stress from her job could also be a contributing factor to ulcer formation. The normal ESR and absence of fever or significant leukocytosis make acute cholecystitis and gallbladder cancer less likely. Choledocholithiasis typically presents with jaundice and elevated liver enzymes, which are not mentioned here.",9
9184,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest serum sickness-like reaction, which can occur after exposure to foreign proteins, such as antivenom used for snake bites. The key features include fever, rash, arthralgia, and proteinuria. Serum sickness is characterized by immune complex deposition, leading to complement activation and consumption. Therefore, decreased serum complement levels are expected in this condition.",9
9237,"The child presents with signs of riboflavin (vitamin B2) deficiency, which include angular cheilitis, glossitis, and anemia. Riboflavin deficiency can also lead to seborrheic dermatitis. The anemia is normocytic, which is consistent with riboflavin deficiency rather than a deficiency that would cause macrocytic anemia (like vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, which would lead to hypersegmented neutrophils). Keratomalacia is associated with vitamin A deficiency, and dilated cardiomyopathy is associated with thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. Therefore, if left untreated, the child is most likely to develop seborrheic dermatitis due to riboflavin deficiency.",9

9259,"The patient is in a critical condition following a motor vehicle accident, showing signs of hypovolemic shock (tachycardia, hypotension, distended abdomen, and weak pulses) and respiratory compromise (low SpO2 and blood in the oropharynx). The immediate priority in trauma management is to secure the airway, especially given the presence of blood in the oropharynx and low oxygen saturation. While a cricothyroidotomy is an invasive procedure, it is indicated here due to the potential for airway obstruction and the need for rapid airway control. Other options like blood transfusion or FAST scan are important but secondary to securing the airway in this scenario.",9
9183,"The patient's symptoms, including abdominal pain, weight loss, diarrhea after meals, history of alcohol use, and palpable liver edge, suggest the possibility of chronic pancreatitis or liver disease. Chronic pancreatitis could lead to malabsorption, explaining the weight loss and diarrhea. The best initial test to evaluate these symptoms would be imaging to assess for pancreatic abnormalities, such as calcifications or structural changes. A CT scan of the abdomen can evaluate the pancreas and other abdominal organs for signs of chronic pancreatitis or any structural abnormalities.",9
9381,"The patient presents with features suggestive of Marfan syndrome, which include tall stature, long fingers (arachnodactyly), scoliosis, and a diastolic murmur indicative of possible aortic regurgitation. The skin findings of red-to-white linear markings could be striae, which are also seen in Marfan syndrome. Marfan syndrome is caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene, which encodes the protein fibrillin-1, a component of connective tissue. The other options are associated with different conditions: COL3A1 is associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, ELN with cutis laxa, and IT15 with Huntington's disease. Therefore, the most likely gene mutation in this patient is FBN1.",9
9241,"The patient's symptoms of chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and a history of an itchy rash (likely dermatitis herpetiformis) are suggestive of celiac disease. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten ingestion, leading to malabsorption and associated symptoms. The rash, dermatitis herpetiformis, is a classic skin manifestation of celiac disease. To confirm the diagnosis of celiac disease, the most specific test is the small bowel biopsy obtained via endoscopy, which would show villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and intraepithelial lymphocytosis. While the serum anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody assay (option C) is a useful screening test for celiac disease, the definitive confirmation is through histological examination of the small bowel mucosa.",9
9423,"The patient presents with symptoms and findings suggestive of cervical cancer, such as postcoital bleeding, an unpleasant odor, and a cervical mass. The presence of a 4-cm exophytic mass with necrosis on the cervix is highly indicative of cervical cancer. The most common cause of cervical cancer is persistent infection with high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly types 16 and 18. The patient's history of having a single sexual partner and no recent gynecologic evaluations does not rule out HPV infection, as HPV can persist for many years before causing cancer. The other options are less likely: hyperestrogenemia is not typically associated with cervical cancer, IUD complications do not usually present with a cervical mass, and radioactive iodine exposure is not linked to cervical cancer.",9
9337,"In assessing the risk factors for completed suicide, several factors are considered more significant. While female sex is associated with higher attempts, males have a higher completion rate, making option A less relevant here. Not having a spouse (option B) can increase isolation, but it's not the strongest risk factor. Firearm possession (option C) significantly increases risk due to the lethality of this method, making it a critical risk factor. Having a previous suicide attempt (option D) is one of the most significant risk factors for future completed suicide because it indicates past intent and willingness to act upon suicidal thoughts. Between possession of a firearm and a previous attempt, the history of a prior attempt is generally considered a more direct indicator of higher risk for future completion.",9

9567,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of organophosphate poisoning, which is common in agricultural settings. Symptoms include altered mental status, twitching (fasciculations), urination, drooling, and coughing, which are consistent with cholinergic crisis due to acetylcholinesterase inhibition. The best immediate treatment for organophosphate poisoning is atropine, which acts as an anticholinergic to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine.",9
9566,"The patient presents with bloody diarrhea after a camping trip where she drank water from streams. This suggests a possible exposure to pathogens found in contaminated water. The key symptoms are bloody diarrhea and fever. Clostridium difficile is unlikely as it typically follows antibiotic use and causes watery diarrhea. Campylobacter is a common cause of bloody diarrhea and can be contracted from contaminated water or food. E. coli 0157:H7 also causes bloody diarrhea but is more commonly associated with undercooked beef or contaminated produce. Shigella can cause bloody diarrhea and is transmitted via fecal-oral route, often in settings with poor sanitation. Given the context of drinking stream water, Campylobacter is the most likely pathogen.",9
9585,"The scenario describes a man who was abused as a child and is now abusing his own family. This suggests he is unconsciously adopting behaviors from his father, who was his abuser. This is an example of the defense mechanism known as 'identification,' where an individual assimilates an aspect, property, or attribute of another and is transformed, wholly or partially, by the model that other provides. In this case, the man is identifying with his abusive father and replicating that behavior in his own family.",9
9644,"The patient presents with chest pain that occurs intermittently and is not consistently related to exertion, along with transient ST elevations on ECG. These features suggest Prinzmetal's angina (variant angina), which is caused by coronary artery spasm rather than significant atherosclerotic blockage. The transient nature of the ST elevations and the minimal blockage seen on angiography support this diagnosis. Prinzmetal's angina is associated with vasospastic disorders, such as Raynaud phenomenon, which involves episodic vasospasm of the extremities. Therefore, the condition most closely associated with this patient's presentation is Raynaud phenomenon.",9
9659,"Teniposide is a chemotherapeutic agent that works by inhibiting the enzyme topoisomerase II. This inhibition leads to an increase in double-stranded DNA breaks because topoisomerase II is responsible for relieving torsional strain in DNA by creating transient double-stranded breaks. By inhibiting this enzyme, teniposide prevents the re-ligation of these breaks, leading to DNA damage and ultimately cell death. Therefore, the mechanism of action of teniposide is best explained by its ability to increase double-stranded DNA breaks.",9
9703,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings are suggestive of a hematological malignancy. The child has symptoms such as fatigue, fever, bleeding, pallor, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly, along with laboratory findings of anemia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. The bone marrow aspirate shows immature leukocytes that are positive for CD10, CD19, and TdT, and negative for myeloperoxidase.

- CD10 and CD19 are markers associated with B-cell lineage.
- Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) is a marker of lymphoid precursors, particularly in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
- The absence of myeloperoxidase staining indicates that the cells are not of myeloid origin.

These findings are consistent with Pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which is common in children and presents with these specific markers.",9
9828,"Inhaled corticosteroids like mometasone are commonly used to manage asthma by reducing inflammation in the airways. However, they can lead to local side effects, such as oral thrush (candidiasis), due to the deposition of the medication in the oropharynx. To prevent this complication, it is recommended that patients rinse their mouth with water and spit it out after using the inhaler. This practice helps remove any residual medication that could contribute to the development of thrush.",9
9821,"The patient's history of previous pulmonary tuberculosis and current symptoms of productive cough with blood-streaked sputum suggest a possible complication such as a mycetoma (fungal ball), often caused by Aspergillus species, in a pre-existing lung cavity. This is supported by the presence of crackles in the right infraclavicular area and the chest x-ray findings, which likely show a cavitary lesion. A characteristic feature of a mycetoma is that it can move within the cavity when the patient's position changes. Therefore, repositioning the patient may cause the mass to move, which corresponds to option A.",9
9845,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are indicative of a viral infection. The presence of a corneal dendritic ulcer with terminal bulbs that stains with rose bengal is characteristic of herpes simplex keratitis. Additionally, the finding of multinucleated giant cells on Giemsa staining supports a viral etiology, specifically herpes simplex virus. HSV-1 is the most common cause of dendritic corneal ulcers and keratitis in adults. The other options, such as Acanthamoeba, Candida albicans, and Pseudomonas, do not typically present with dendritic ulcers or multinucleated giant cells.",9

9895,"The clinical presentation of the 5-year-old girl includes a high fever, rash that involves the palms and soles, conjunctival injection, and significant swelling of the extremities. These symptoms, along with the laboratory findings of neutrophilic leukocytosis and elevated CRP, are suggestive of Kawasaki disease. Kawasaki disease is characterized by prolonged fever, rash, conjunctivitis, changes in the extremities (such as swelling), and cervical lymphadenopathy. The presence of hyperbilirubinemia and increased ɣ-GT can also occur in Kawasaki disease due to liver involvement. The normal platelet count is not typical, as thrombocytosis is often seen later in the course, but it does not rule out the diagnosis. Scarlet fever, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome do not fit the full clinical picture as well as Kawasaki disease does.",9
9904,"The patient's symptoms of fatigue, pruritus, and icterus, along with the laboratory findings of elevated alkaline phosphatase and cholesterol, suggest a cholestatic liver disease. Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), now known as primary biliary cholangitis, is characterized by the presence of anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) in the majority of cases. In contrast, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is often associated with p-ANCA positivity and 'onion skin fibrosis' on liver biopsy. The presence of AMA is a key distinguishing feature of PBC over PSC.",9
9880,"The ACGME sets specific guidelines for resident work hours to ensure patient safety and resident well-being. According to the ACGME standards:

- Residents should not work more than 80 hours per week, averaged over four weeks.
- Residents should have at least one day free of duty every week, averaged over four weeks.
- Residents should have a minimum of 8 hours off between scheduled duty periods.
- Residents should not be scheduled for more than 24 hours of continuous duty, with an additional 4 hours allowed for transitions of care.

In this scenario:

- The resident worked a maximum of 76 hours per week, which is within the 80-hour limit.
- The resident had one day off per week, which meets the requirement.
- The resident had a minimum of 12 hours off between duty periods, which exceeds the 8-hour minimum.
- The resident was on duty for 27 hours continuously when receiving the patient, which exceeds the 24-hour limit plus the 4-hour transition period, totaling 28 hours. Therefore, the 27th hour of continuous duty is in violation of the ACGME standards.",9
9628,"The patient has atrial fibrillation, as indicated by the irregularly irregular pulse and absence of distinct P waves on ECG. The drug used for treatment is likely a calcium channel blocker, such as diltiazem or verapamil, which slows AV node conduction and prevents calcium entry into myocytes. One of the common adverse effects of calcium channel blockers, particularly the dihydropyridine class, is peripheral edema. However, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers like verapamil and diltiazem can also cause gingival hyperplasia, although it is more commonly associated with drugs like phenytoin and cyclosporine. In this context, the most likely adverse effect related to the calcium channel blocker used for atrial fibrillation is gingival hyperplasia.",8
9959,"The boy presents with symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure (headache, nausea, vomiting, papilledema) and signs of meningeal irritation (positive Brudzinski's sign). The history of tooth pain suggests a possible dental infection that could have spread, leading to a brain abscess. The fever, confusion, and focal neurological signs (sluggish pupils) further support an infectious process. Medulloblastoma is less likely due to the acute presentation and lack of cerebellar signs. HSV encephalitis typically presents with fever, altered mental status, and focal neurological deficits, but the history of tooth pain and the pattern of symptoms are more consistent with a brain abscess. Cavernous sinus thrombosis would present with ocular signs and cranial nerve deficits, which are not prominent here. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a pyogenic brain abscess.",9
9981,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI), specifically pyelonephritis, given the fever and right costovertebral angle tenderness. Pyelonephritis is typically caused by bacteria ascending from the bladder to the kidneys. The patient's sexual activity and inconsistent condom use may increase the risk of UTIs, but the key factor here is the pathophysiology of pyelonephritis, which involves bacteria ascending from the bladder. Ascending bacteria from the endocervix would be more related to pelvic inflammatory disease, which is not indicated by the symptoms. Noninfectious inflammation of the bladder and decreased urinary pH are not consistent with the presentation of fever and costovertebral angle tenderness.",9
9996,"The patient's symptoms and clinical findings suggest a diagnosis of Crohn's disease. She has chronic diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain, weight loss, and perianal disease (skin tags and anal fissure), which are characteristic of Crohn's disease. On endoscopy, Crohn's disease typically shows focal ulcerations, and histologically, non-caseating granulomas may be present. This is in contrast to ulcerative colitis, which would show diffuse, continuous inflammation and friable mucosa with pinpoint hemorrhages. Therefore, the most likely finding on endoscopy and biopsy for this patient is focal ulcerations with granuloma.",9
10001,"The histological description provided in the question indicates the presence of simple cuboidal cells and smooth muscle, with the absence of chondrocytes and goblet cells. This suggests a part of the respiratory system that is distal to the bronchi, as bronchi contain cartilage (chondrocytes) and goblet cells. The absence of these structures points towards the bronchioles. 

Among the bronchioles, the terminal bronchioles are lined with simple cuboidal epithelium and have smooth muscle, but they do not have cartilage or goblet cells. Conducting bronchioles also lack cartilage and goblet cells but are lined with ciliated columnar epithelium. Respiratory bronchioles, which are distal to terminal bronchioles, have simple cuboidal epithelium and are involved in gas exchange, but the question does not specify any alveolar structures which are characteristic of respiratory bronchioles.

Therefore, the description best fits the terminal bronchiole, which is characterized by simple cuboidal epithelium and smooth muscle, without cartilage or goblet cells.",9
10039,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of adrenal insufficiency, likely due to the abrupt cessation or inadequate dosing of prednisone, which she has been taking for her sarcoidosis. Her symptoms include hypotension, hypoglycemia, and gastrointestinal distress, which are consistent with adrenal crisis. In the context of long-term glucocorticoid therapy, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is suppressed, leading to decreased production of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). When exogenous steroids are reduced or stopped, the body cannot produce adequate cortisol due to this suppression. Therefore, in this scenario, we would expect decreased levels of CRH and ACTH. However, the question asks for the most likely laboratory change, which would be decreased CRH due to the suppression of the HPA axis from chronic steroid use.",9
10040,"The patient's symptoms are suggestive of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), characterized by an urge to move the legs, usually accompanied by uncomfortable sensations, which are relieved by movement. RLS symptoms typically occur at night and can disrupt sleep. Iron deficiency is a known contributor to RLS, and iron studies are often recommended to assess for this. If iron deficiency is present, supplementation can improve symptoms. Therefore, the best initial step in management is to check iron levels to determine if iron deficiency is contributing to her symptoms.",9
10077,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), including elevated alpha-fetoprotein and liver enlargement. The genetic mutation described, a G:C to T:A transversion in codon 249 of the TP53 gene, is specifically associated with exposure to aflatoxins. Aflatoxins are carcinogens produced by certain molds found in improperly stored grains and nuts, and they are known to cause this specific mutation in the TP53 gene, leading to HCC. While other risk factors like hepatitis C and hemochromatosis can also lead to HCC, the specific mutation described is most closely linked to aflatoxin exposure.",9
10076,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), likely an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) given the acute chest pain, sweating, and shortness of breath. His risk factors include diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and a significant smoking history. The ECG, although not shown here, is likely indicative of STEMI given the context of the question. Initial management with aspirin and nitroglycerin has been provided. The blood pressure is low, and the heart rate is elevated, which suggests hemodynamic instability. In the setting of STEMI, the most appropriate next step is to restore coronary blood flow as quickly as possible. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the preferred method for reperfusion in STEMI if it can be performed in a timely manner. Other options like echocardiography or observation do not address the acute need for reperfusion, and metoprolol is contraindicated in the setting of hypotension and possible cardiogenic shock.",9
10078,"The patient presents with vaginal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, elevated prothrombin time, and renal dysfunction. These findings suggest a coagulopathy, likely disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). DIC can occur due to various obstetric complications, one of which is placental abruption. Placental abruption involves the separation of the placenta from the uterus, leading to bleeding and the release of thromboplastin into the maternal circulation, which triggers DIC. The elevated prothrombin time and low platelet count are consistent with this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism is the release of thromboplastin into the maternal circulation due to placental abruption.",9
9948,"Exenatide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist used to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. It can be combined with metformin, so option A is incorrect. Exenatide is known to have beneficial effects on body weight and glycemic control, but it has not been specifically associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes, making option B correct. The risk of hypoglycemia with exenatide is low unless used with insulin or sulfonylureas, so option C is incorrect. It can be combined with insulin, although with caution, making option D incorrect.",9
10086,"The patient's EKG shows fast sawtooth waves at 200/min, which is indicative of atrial flutter. The symptoms of ringing in the ears, headache, flushed skin, and a spinning sensation after medication administration suggest cinchonism, a side effect associated with quinidine. Quinidine is a Class IA antiarrhythmic drug. Class IA drugs decrease the rate of phase 0 depolarization and increase the action potential duration by blocking sodium channels and also blocking potassium channels, which prolongs repolarization. Therefore, the medication administered is likely quinidine, which has the properties of decreased rate of phase 0 depolarization and increased action potential duration.",9

10094,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of diabetes (polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia) and laboratory findings consistent with diabetic nephropathy (elevated creatinine, albuminuria, and glucose in urine). The specific gravity of 1.070 indicates concentrated urine, which is unusual given the polyuria, suggesting possible osmotic diuresis due to glucosuria. The enlarged kidneys on ultrasound are also consistent with diabetic nephropathy. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is diabetic nephropathy, which does not require further renal imaging or arteriography. Urine protein electrophoresis is not indicated as the proteinuria is likely due to diabetes. Therefore, no further renal tests are required at this point, as the clinical picture is consistent with diabetic nephropathy.",9
10124,"The patient presents with symptoms and lab findings consistent with acute hepatitis, and the detection of hepatitis C virus RNA by PCR confirms an active hepatitis C infection. The negative anti-hepatitis C antibody suggests this is a recent infection, as antibodies may not have developed yet. In hepatitis C infections, the majority of cases (about 75-85%) progress to chronic hepatitis, which is characterized by persistent infection and liver inflammation. This chronic infection can slowly progress over years, potentially leading to liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma if untreated. However, the most immediate and common outcome without treatment is chronic hepatitis, which is a slowly progressive condition. Fulminant hepatitis is rare in hepatitis C infections, and transient infection (spontaneous clearance) occurs in a minority of cases (15-25%). Therefore, the most likely outcome without treatment is slowly progressive hepatitis.",9
10103,"The clinical presentation of the child, including fever, fatigue, bone pain, and pancytopenia (anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis with a high white blood cell count), is suggestive of leukemia. The child also has Down syndrome, which increases the risk of acute leukemia, particularly acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To confirm the diagnosis of leukemia, a bone marrow biopsy is necessary as it will show the presence of leukemic blasts and help in determining the specific type of leukemia.",9
10140,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest a diagnosis of pyruvate kinase deficiency. This condition is characterized by hemolytic anemia, which explains the patient's fatigue, pallor, and history of requiring blood transfusions. The presence of echinocytes (burr cells) and rigid red blood cells on the peripheral smear is indicative of this condition. Pyruvate kinase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder, which is the mode of inheritance for this condition.",9
10144,"The patient's symptoms of carpopedal spasms, peri-oral numbness, paresthesias, and a history of seizure are indicative of hypocalcemia. The history of total thyroidectomy suggests possible damage or removal of the parathyroid glands, leading to hypoparathyroidism. This would result in decreased parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, decreased serum calcium, and increased serum phosphate due to the lack of PTH's effects on the kidneys and bones. The Chvostek sign and QT prolongation are also associated with hypocalcemia. Therefore, the correct combination of findings would be Chvostek sign, QT prolongation, decreased PTH, decreased serum calcium, and increased serum phosphate.",9
10015,"This patient presents with a history of alcohol abuse and clinical signs suggestive of liver dysfunction (ascites, bleeding at IV sites, low platelet count). His elevated AST and ALT levels further suggest liver injury. These findings are consistent with coagulopathy due to liver disease, which is likely leading to bleeding issues due to the reduced production of coagulation factors by the liver. Phytonadione (vitamin K) is used to address coagulopathy from vitamin K deficiency. However, in the context of a bleeding coagulopathy due to liver dysfunction, the most immediate and effective treatment is fresh frozen plasma (FFP), which provides all the necessary coagulation factors.",9
1954,"The patient presents with lethargy, pinpoint pupils, and respiratory depression (respiratory rate of 6/min) following a femur fracture. These symptoms are suggestive of opioid overdose, likely due to pain management post-surgery. The ABG shows respiratory acidosis with elevated PaCO2 and low pH, consistent with hypoventilation. The most appropriate therapy for opioid overdose is naloxone, an opioid antagonist, which can rapidly reverse the effects of opioids.",9
1953,"The presentation of an expanding erythematous patch with a target-like appearance, along with systemic symptoms such as low-grade fever and lymphadenopathy, is suggestive of Lyme disease. The history of recent camping, which could involve exposure to ticks, supports this diagnosis. Tinea corporis typically presents as a ring-shaped lesion with a scaly border, not a target-like lesion. Granuloma annulare usually presents as skin-colored or erythematous papules that form rings, not target lesions. Hansen’s disease (leprosy) presents with hypopigmented or erythematous patches with sensory loss, which does not match this presentation. The presence of a pet cat could suggest cat scratch disease, but the target-like lesion is more characteristic of Lyme disease.",9
10109,"The patient has symptoms suggestive of a peptic ulcer, likely due to Helicobacter pylori infection, as indicated by the positive urea breath test. The standard treatment for H. pylori involves a combination of antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor. Given her allergy to azithromycin and clarithromycin, she likely received an alternative regimen that includes metronidazole. Metronidazole can cause a disulfiram-like reaction when alcohol is consumed, leading to flushing, headaches, nausea, and vomiting. This reaction occurs because metronidazole inhibits the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, leading to the accumulation of acetaldehyde when alcohol is consumed. Therefore, the mechanism of the drug involved in the adverse reaction is related to the inhibition of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, which is not directly listed in the options. However, the closest mechanism related to metronidazole's action is the formation of free radicals, which is how it exerts its antimicrobial effect.",9
10155,"The clinical presentation suggests hereditary angioedema, characterized by episodes of swelling without urticaria, often triggered by trauma or stress, such as a tooth extraction. The family history of similar episodes supports this diagnosis. Hereditary angioedema is due to a deficiency or dysfunction of C1 esterase inhibitor, leading to increased bradykinin levels, which cause the swelling. The most appropriate treatment targets the bradykinin pathway. Therefore, a drug that acts as an antagonist at the bradykinin receptor would be effective in managing this condition.",9
10148,"The patient is experiencing symptoms consistent with an allergic reaction, specifically anaphylaxis, due to exposure to peanuts. Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that occurs rapidly after exposure to an allergen. The symptoms include difficulty breathing, facial flushing, itching, and stridor, which are indicative of anaphylaxis. This type of reaction is mediated by IgE antibodies that trigger mast cell and basophil degranulation, leading to the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators. This is characteristic of a Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction. Type 2 hypersensitivity involves antibody-mediated cytotoxicity, Type 3 involves immune complex deposition, and neither are relevant to this clinical scenario. Therefore, the correct answer is Type 1 hypersensitivity.",9
2098,"The clinical presentation of the child includes fever, lethargy, and a rash characterized by flaccid blisters that rupture easily, leaving areas of erythematous moist skin. The positive Nikolsky sign (blister formation upon rubbing the skin) is also noted. The laboratory findings show leukocytosis with a predominance of neutrophils and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, indicating an inflammatory process. The normal oropharyngeal examination and the absence of respiratory or urinary symptoms help narrow down the differential diagnosis.

Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) is characterized by fever, irritability, and a diffuse erythematous rash that progresses to blistering and desquamation, particularly in young children. The Nikolsky sign is positive in SSSS, which matches the clinical findings in this case.

Pemphigus vulgaris typically presents with mucosal involvement and is rare in children. Scarlet fever is associated with a sandpaper-like rash and is usually accompanied by pharyngitis. Bullous pemphigoid is more common in the elderly and presents with tense blisters rather than flaccid ones.

Given the age of the patient, the clinical presentation, and the positive Nikolsky sign, the most likely diagnosis is Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome.",9
2139,"The child presents with symptoms consistent with scarlet fever, which is caused by Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes). The rash, fever, sore throat, and sandpaper-like texture of the rash are characteristic. The white coating on the tongue, which can later become a 'strawberry tongue,' is also typical. The physician is concerned about a complication that can occur if the infection is left untreated. One of the well-known complications of untreated streptococcal pharyngitis is rheumatic fever, which can lead to rheumatic heart disease. The mechanism underlying rheumatic fever is molecular mimicry, where the immune system attacks the body's own tissues because of similarities between streptococcal antigens and human tissue antigens. This autoimmune response can lead to damage of the heart valves, joints, and other tissues.",9

2391,"The patient presents with severe retrosternal chest pain and odynophagia (painful swallowing), which are symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation or ulceration. The endoscopy shows a single punched-out ulcer at the gastroesophageal junction. The patient's medication list includes alendronate, a bisphosphonate known to cause esophageal irritation and ulceration if not taken properly (e.g., without adequate water or lying down soon after taking it). Given the location and appearance of the ulcer, it is likely that alendronate is the cause. Discontinuing alendronate is the most appropriate next step to prevent further esophageal damage.",9
2524,"The clinical presentation of the 32-day-old boy suggests a problem with neutrophil function. The key findings include a necrotic umbilical cord, recurrent infections (fever, bulging tympanic membrane, and perirectal abscess), and delayed separation of the umbilical cord. These symptoms are characteristic of Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency (LAD), which is a disorder of neutrophil migration. In LAD, there is a defect in the integrins that are necessary for neutrophils to adhere to the endothelium and migrate to sites of infection. This results in impaired neutrophil migration, leading to recurrent bacterial infections and delayed umbilical cord separation. Therefore, the most likely abnormal process in this patient is neutrophil migration.",9
2484,"The clinical presentation of tea-colored urine, facial edema, and hypertension in this child, following a recent history of sore throat, is suggestive of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). This condition typically occurs after a streptococcal infection, such as pharyngitis or skin infection. The key pathological mechanism in PSGN is the deposition of immune complexes in the glomeruli. These immune complexes are formed by antibodies reacting with streptococcal antigens, leading to complement activation and inflammation in the glomeruli. This results in the characteristic findings of hematuria, proteinuria, and hypertension. Therefore, the best representation of the mechanism of this patient's condition is immune complex deposition.",9
2287,,0
2221,"This patient presents with signs of acute decompensated heart failure, likely due to non-compliance with his medications. The low blood pressure (85/50 mm Hg) indicates hypoperfusion. The low renal perfusion pressure would activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), leading to increased plasma renin and angiotensin II activity. Additionally, the presence of hypoperfusion and the probable accumulation of lactic acid due to poor oxygen delivery would likely result in a metabolic acidosis, leading to a decreased serum pH. These findings align with option C: ↑ Plasma renin and angiotensin II activity, ↓ blood pressure, ↓ renal perfusion pressure, ↓ serum pH.",9
2766,"In this scenario, the patient is a minor and the father, who is the official healthcare proxy, has confirmed that the family are Jehovah's Witnesses and do not want blood transfusions. Generally, adults have the right to refuse medical treatment, including blood transfusions, based on religious beliefs. However, when it comes to minors, the situation is more complex. The state has an interest in protecting the welfare of children, which can sometimes override parental wishes, especially in life-threatening situations. In emergencies where a child's life is at risk, physicians may provide life-saving treatment, including blood transfusions, despite parental refusal. Therefore, the best next step is to transfuse the boy to save his life, while respecting the mother's wishes as an adult.",9
2712,"The patient presents with fever, fatigue, weight loss, and a history of recurrent infections, which are suggestive of a hematologic malignancy. The laboratory findings show anemia (hemoglobin 10 g/dL), leukocytosis (leukocyte count 18,000/mm3), and thrombocytopenia (platelet count 40,000/mm3). The presence of petechiae and purpura further supports a bleeding tendency due to low platelets. The enlarged lymph nodes in the axillary and cervical regions suggest lymphadenopathy. 

The key to the diagnosis lies in the peripheral blood smear, which is not shown here, but we can infer from the options and clinical presentation. Hairy cell leukemia typically presents with pancytopenia and splenomegaly, not lymphadenopathy. Burkitt lymphoma is associated with a high-grade lymphoma often presenting with a mass, not typically with the described blood findings. MALT lymphoma is usually a localized disease associated with mucosal sites, not typically presenting with the described systemic symptoms and blood findings.

Acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) can present with anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis with circulating blasts, which fits the clinical and laboratory picture described. The recurrent infections, fatigue, and bleeding tendencies are consistent with AML.",9
2779,"The patient presents with signs and symptoms suggestive of gastric cancer, particularly in the context of a previous partial gastrectomy, which increases the risk of gastric stump cancer. The biopsy findings are consistent with adenocarcinoma. The next step in management should focus on staging the cancer to guide treatment decisions. An abdominopelvic CT scan is appropriate for staging gastric cancer as it helps assess the extent of the disease, including local invasion and distant metastasis. Laparoscopy is also used for staging but is typically performed after imaging studies. Stool antigen testing for H. pylori and vitamin B12 assessment are not immediate priorities in the context of a confirmed gastric mass with biopsy-proven malignancy.",9
2791,"The patient has been diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma, and the molecular analysis indicates the presence of a receptor associated with poor prognosis. In breast cancer, the receptors commonly tested are estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2/neu. HER2 positivity is associated with a more aggressive disease and poorer prognosis. Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the HER2 receptor and is used in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. Given the context of the question, the receptor associated with poor prognosis is likely HER2, making trastuzumab the appropriate treatment choice.",9

This suggests the Somogyi effect, where low blood glucose levels during the night lead to a rebound hyperglycemia in the morning due to counter-regulatory hormone release. The appropriate management for the Somogyi effect is to decrease the nighttime insulin dose to prevent the nocturnal hypoglycemia that triggers the rebound hyperglycemia.",9

The biopsy findings of mucosal and submucosal involvement with crypt abscesses further support this diagnosis. Ulcerative colitis is associated with an increased risk of developing primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a chronic liver disease characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the bile ducts. PSC is more commonly associated with UC than with Crohn's disease. The other options, such as cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and primary biliary cirrhosis, are not as directly associated with ulcerative colitis as PSC is.",9

2831,"The meal consisting of meat riblets and beef strips is high in protein and fat, which would typically lead to digestive hormone changes. Gastrin is released in response to proteins in the stomach to increase gastric acid secretion (protons), not decrease it, ruling out A. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is released by I cells in the duodenum in response to fats and proteins to stimulate pancreatic enzyme secretion and gallbladder contraction, meaning B is incorrect because cholecystokinin release would increase, not decrease. Secretin is released in response to acidic chyme in the duodenum to stimulate bicarbonate secretion from the pancreas, but this meal will primarily lead to an increase in CCK rather than secretin, especially since secretin is more responsive to acids than fats or proteins, making C incorrect. The vagus nerve stimulates digestive activity, including the release of ACh, which would typically increase during a meal, making D incorrect. Therefore, the logical answer is an increase in CCK release.",7

3464,"The patient presents with profuse, almost clear diarrhea, which is indicative of a loss of isotonic fluid. This type of fluid loss leads to a decrease in extracellular fluid volume without a change in osmolarity because both water and electrolytes are lost proportionally. As a result, there is no osmotic gradient created to cause a shift of water between the intracellular and extracellular compartments. Therefore, the intracellular volume remains unchanged. This scenario is best represented by a decrease in extracellular volume with no change in osmolarity, which corresponds to option B.",9

3292,"The patient presents with shortness of breath, palpitations, and a rapid, irregular pulse. His past medical history includes hypertension and coronary artery disease, and he takes medications such as aspirin, metoprolol, lisinopril, and clopidogrel. The key findings on examination are a rapid (pulse 136/min) and irregular heart rhythm, and an ECG (although not provided, inferred results) is performed.

The irregularly irregular rhythm strongly suggests atrial fibrillation (AF). The most likely causes in this clinical setting, especially given the patient's history of coronary artery disease, include re-entry circuits within the atria, often precipitated by factors such as enlargement and fibrosis of the atria.

Looking at the options:

- **A. Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs):** These would cause an irregular heartbeat but are not typically rapid and do not generally cause sustained irregular rhythms unless turning into something like ventricular tachycardia.

- **B. Abnormal automaticity within the ventricle:** This could lead to arrhythmias like ventricular tachycardia but is less likely to cause an irregularly irregular pattern typical of AF.

- **C. Degeneration of sinoatrial node automaticity:** This leads more to bradycardia or arrhythmias such as sick sinus syndrome, not a rapid irregular rhythm.

- **D. Wandering atrial pacemaker:** This involves pacemaker activity shifting within the atria, causing slight irregularity with varying P-wave morphologies, but it is typically slower and not associated with the rapid rates or significant irregularity seen in this patient.

The scenario is most consistent with atrial fibrillation, which can occur secondary to atrial enlargement or fibrosis, often involving re-entrant circuits but not explicitly listed as an option. However, given the provided options and evidence, the irregular rhythm points most clearly to AF.

Hence, the best choice considering the given options is:

**C. Degeneration of sinoatrial node automaticity** is incorrect for AF; focus is actually on the underlying atrial mechanics not quickened in the list here, but sic middles between symptoms and C for the hypothetic cause.",7

3641,"The patient presents with recurrent pneumonia in the right lower lobe, a large pleural effusion, and a mass near the hilum of the right lung. The cytologic examination of the pleural fluid shows evidence of malignancy. Given the patient's significant smoking history and the location of the mass, small cell lung cancer is a likely consideration. Small cell lung cancer is strongly associated with smoking and often presents centrally near the hilum. It can also cause paraneoplastic syndromes and is known for early metastasis, which could explain the malignant pleural effusion. Pulmonary hamartoma is a benign tumor and unlikely to cause malignant pleural effusion. Mesothelioma typically involves the pleura diffusely and is less associated with smoking. Metastatic lung disease would require a known primary cancer elsewhere, which is not indicated here. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is small cell lung cancer.",9

3786,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of serotonin syndrome, characterized by hyperthermia, autonomic instability (elevated blood pressure and heart rate), altered mental status, neuromuscular hyperactivity (clonus, hyperreflexia), and diaphoresis. Given her history of major depressive disorder and social anxiety disorder, she may be on medications such as SSRIs or SNRIs, which can lead to serotonin syndrome if overdosed. The presence of clonus and hyperreflexia are particularly indicative of serotonin syndrome. Cyproheptadine is an antihistamine with antiserotonergic properties and is used to treat serotonin syndrome. Other options like ammonium chloride, flumazenil, and naloxone are not appropriate for treating serotonin syndrome. Ammonium chloride is used for urinary acidification, flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonist, and naloxone is an opioid antagonist.",9

PCD is associated with Kartagener syndrome, which includes situs inversus, chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis. The question asks for an associated finding with the most likely diagnosis. The options include: 

A. Diastolic murmur along the right lower sternal border could be associated with situs inversus, a part of Kartagener syndrome, as the heart could be on the opposite side.
B. Hypocalcemia is not typically associated with PCD.
C. Repeat sinus infections secondary to allergies would not explain the bronchiectasis and other symptoms.
D. Social withdrawal and avoidance of eye contact suggest autism spectrum disorder, which does not fit the clinical picture.

Thus, the diastolic murmur due to situs inversus is most consistent with the syndrome associated with PCD.",9
3789,"The patient presents with signs of pneumonia, likely due to a gram-negative organism given the Gram stain results showing oxidase-positive gram-negative rods. This suggests the possibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common cause of pneumonia in patients with underlying lung disease such as COPD. The patient is also immunocompromised due to stage IV colon cancer and chemotherapy, increasing the risk of infection with resistant organisms. 

The most appropriate treatment for suspected Pseudomonas pneumonia includes antibiotics with activity against Pseudomonas. Cefepime is a fourth-generation cephalosporin with good activity against Pseudomonas, and levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone that also covers Pseudomonas and provides additional coverage for atypical organisms. 

Clarithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanate are not appropriate as they do not cover Pseudomonas. Vancomycin is used for gram-positive organisms, particularly MRSA, and colistin is reserved for multidrug-resistant gram-negative infections due to its toxicity profile.

Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is cefepime and levofloxacin.",9
3802,"The patient's presentation is consistent with gout, characterized by sudden onset of pain, swelling, and erythema in the MTP joint of the big toe. Gout is caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals due to hyperuricemia. Certain medications can exacerbate gout by increasing uric acid levels. Hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, is known to increase serum uric acid levels and can precipitate gout attacks. Colchicine and indomethacin are used to treat gout, while methotrexate is used for other conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and is not typically associated with gout exacerbation.",9
3795,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which is characterized by the triad of hemolytic anemia, acute kidney injury, and thrombocytopenia. The history of consuming undercooked beef and the identification of E. coli O157:H7 in the stool strongly suggest an infection by this specific strain of E. coli, which is known to produce a toxin similar to Shiga toxin. This toxin is responsible for the bloody diarrhea and the subsequent development of HUS. While both Shiga toxin and verotoxin are terms used to describe the toxin produced by E. coli O157:H7, verotoxin is the more specific term used in this context. Enterotoxin type B and erythrogenic toxin are not associated with E. coli O157:H7 infections.",9

3886,"The patient is showing signs of muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, autonomic instability (elevated heart rate and blood pressure), and increased end tidal CO2, which are indicative of malignant hyperthermia. This condition is often triggered by exposure to certain anesthetic agents or succinylcholine during surgery. The most appropriate treatment for malignant hyperthermia is dantrolene, a muscle relaxant that works by reducing calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle, thereby alleviating the symptoms.",9
3891,"The patient is presenting with signs of renal transplant dysfunction, including increased creatinine levels, decreased urine output, fever, and tenderness over the graft site. The biopsy shows tubulitis, which is indicative of acute cellular rejection. The negative C4d staining suggests that antibody-mediated rejection is unlikely. Acute cellular rejection is primarily mediated by the recipient's T cells recognizing the donor antigens, leading to T cell activation and subsequent attack on the graft. This aligns with option C, allorecognition with T cell activation, as the most likely cause of the patient's findings.",9
3937,"The question involves identifying a transcription factor using a labeled oligonucleotide probe. Western blot is used for detecting proteins, Northern blot is for RNA, and PCR is for amplifying DNA. Southwestern blotting is specifically used to detect DNA-binding proteins, such as transcription factors, by using a labeled DNA probe. Since the investigator is identifying a transcription factor, which is a DNA-binding protein, the appropriate technique is the Southwestern blot.",9
10169,"The patient presents with bilateral renal masses, hypertension, and a family history of kidney disease, which are suggestive of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). In ADPKD, there is an increased risk of intracranial aneurysms, particularly berry aneurysms, which can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage. Given the family history and the presentation, it is important to assess for the presence of intracranial aneurysms. CT angiography of the head is a non-invasive method to evaluate for these aneurysms. The other options do not directly address the potential complications associated with ADPKD.",9
9857,"Multiple sclerosis is characterized by an autoimmune response where T-lymphocytes attack the body's own myelin sheaths. This suggests a failure in the immune system's ability to distinguish self from non-self. During T-lymphocyte development in the thymus, negative selection is the process where T-cells that strongly bind to self-antigens are eliminated. A defect in negative selection would allow self-reactive T-cells to survive and potentially cause autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis. Positive selection ensures T-cells can recognize self-MHC molecules, while D-J and V-DJ rearrangements are involved in the generation of T-cell receptor diversity, not in self-tolerance. Therefore, a defect in negative selection is most likely responsible for the autoimmune nature of multiple sclerosis.",9
2187,"The presentation of the 8-month-old boy includes decreased activity, excessive sleepiness, difficulty arousing, a full anterior fontanelle, posterior rib fractures, and bilateral retinal hemorrhages. These findings are highly suggestive of non-accidental trauma, specifically shaken baby syndrome, which is a form of child abuse. The posterior rib fractures are indicative of squeezing, and retinal hemorrhages are classic for shaken baby syndrome. The full anterior fontanelle could indicate increased intracranial pressure, possibly due to subdural hematomas, which are also common in shaken baby syndrome. The history of the child hitting his head while crawling is unlikely to cause such severe injuries. Vitamin K deficiency would lead to bleeding issues but not typically cause rib fractures or retinal hemorrhages. Osteogenesis imperfecta could cause fractures but not retinal hemorrhages. Bacterial meningitis could cause lethargy and a full fontanelle but not rib fractures or retinal hemorrhages.",9

3179,"The patient has sustained nondisplaced rib fractures from trauma, which is causing severe pain and mild shortness of breath. His vital signs are stable, and the oxygen saturation is adequate. The main concern with rib fractures is pain management to ensure adequate ventilation and prevent complications such as atelectasis or pneumonia. The chest X-ray shows clear lung fields, indicating no pneumothorax or hemothorax. The focused assessment with sonography for trauma is negative, ruling out significant internal injuries. Given these findings, the most appropriate next step is to provide adequate analgesia to manage the pain and allow for proper breathing. Conservative management is typically sufficient for nondisplaced rib fractures in a stable patient.",9

4019,"The patient is a 71-year-old man experiencing decreased sexual performance, including longer time to achieve an erection, difficulty maintaining an erection, less forceful ejaculations, and a longer refractory period. These symptoms are common in aging men and are often due to physiological changes rather than pathological conditions. The patient's examination and lab results do not indicate vascular, psychogenic, or neurogenic causes. His intact pedal pulses and sensation suggest that vascular and neurogenic causes are unlikely. The absence of marital conflicts and the chronic nature of the symptoms make a psychogenic cause less likely. Therefore, the most likely etiology is physiological changes associated with aging.",9
4025,"The newborn presents with jaundice, lethargy, anemia (hemoglobin 9.6 g/dL), and a positive direct Coombs test. These findings suggest hemolytic disease of the newborn, likely due to Rh or ABO incompatibility. The positive Coombs test indicates that the baby's red blood cells are coated with maternal antibodies, leading to hemolysis. In such cases, extramedullary hematopoiesis can occur due to increased demand for red blood cell production, which often results in hepatosplenomegaly. This is because the liver and spleen become sites of increased blood cell production to compensate for the hemolysis.",9
4044,"The patient's symptoms include agitation, combativeness, violent behavior, nystagmus (both horizontal and vertical), tachycardia, and diaphoresis. These symptoms are characteristic of phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication. PCP is known to cause dissociative symptoms, hallucinations, and can lead to violent behavior. The presence of nystagmus, especially both horizontal and vertical, is particularly indicative of PCP use. Cocaine can cause agitation and tachycardia but is less associated with nystagmus. GHB typically causes CNS depression rather than agitation. LSD can cause hallucinations and agitation but is not associated with nystagmus. Therefore, the most likely causative agent is PCP.",9
4050,"The clinical presentation of the 2-year-old boy, including gingival growth, pain, and multiple soft tissue density lesions in the craniofacial region, suggests a systemic condition. The presence of necrotic slough on the gingiva and the CT findings are indicative of a proliferative disorder. Among the options, Birbeck granules are specific to Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH), a condition that can present with such symptoms, including bone lesions and gingival involvement. The other options are associated with different conditions: ragged red fibers with mitochondrial myopathies, prominent perifascicular atrophy with dermatomyositis, and endomysial infiltrates with polymyositis. Therefore, the presence of Birbeck granules would be the most specific indicator of LCH in this patient.",9

4070,"The patient's symptoms are suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), characterized by bilateral hand pain, morning stiffness, and worsening symptoms over time. RA is an autoimmune disease where the immune system produces antibodies against the body's own antibodies, specifically targeting the Fc portion of IgG. These are known as rheumatoid factors. Therefore, the pathogenesis involves the production of antibodies against antibodies.",9
4072,"The clinical description of the lesion as a hyperpigmented papule with a greasy, wax-like, and stuck-on appearance is characteristic of seborrheic keratosis. Histologically, seborrheic keratosis is characterized by immature keratinocytes and the presence of small keratin-filled cysts, known as horn cysts. This matches the description in option C. 

Option A describes findings typical of melanoma, which is not consistent with the clinical presentation. 

Option B describes koilocytes, which are associated with HPV infections and warts, not seborrheic keratosis. 

Option D describes fibroblast proliferation, which is more typical of dermatofibroma, not seborrheic keratosis.",9
4092,"The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are suggestive of aortic stenosis. The key features include exertional chest pain, lightheadedness, syncope, and a systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border with a soft S2. These are classic signs of aortic stenosis, which is often due to calcific degeneration in older adults. However, in younger patients or those presenting earlier, a bicuspid aortic valve is a common cause. Given the patient's age, a bicuspid aortic valve could have led to earlier onset of symptoms due to accelerated calcification. The murmur described is consistent with aortic stenosis, and increased blood flow velocity through the aortic valve is characteristic of this condition due to the narrowed valve opening. Pulsus paradoxus is associated with conditions like cardiac tamponade, not aortic stenosis. Decreased murmur intensity with squatting is more characteristic of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, not aortic stenosis. Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient, given the context of aortic stenosis, is increased blood flow velocity through the aortic valve.",9

4134,"The patient presents with chest pain and shortness of breath, which are concerning for several potential etiologies. The key details include the sharp nature of the pain, its reproducibility with deep inspiration and palpation, and the recent long flight. While a pulmonary embolism (clot in the pulmonary arteries) is a consideration due to the flight, the normal oxygen saturation and the fact that the pain is reproducible with palpation suggest a musculoskeletal cause. Myocardial ischemia is less likely given her age, lack of risk factors, and the nature of the pain. A psychogenic cause could be considered due to anxiety, but the reproducibility of pain with palpation strongly points to a musculoskeletal origin. Therefore, the most likely etiology is musculoskeletal inflammation.",9
4163,"The patient presents with a persistent nonproductive cough that is worse at night, with no significant findings on physical examination or chest X-ray. Her FEV1 is normal, indicating no obstructive lung disease. The history of a runny nose every morning during winter suggests allergic rhinitis, which can lead to postnasal drip, a common cause of chronic cough. The absence of fever, productive cough, or systemic symptoms makes an infectious cause less likely, ruling out the need for antibiotics like amoxicillin-clavulanate. Prednisone is not indicated as there is no evidence of an inflammatory or autoimmune process. Acetylcysteine is used for mucus thinning in conditions like COPD or cystic fibrosis, which is not applicable here. Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine, can address postnasal drip due to allergic rhinitis, making it the most appropriate next step.",9
4172,"The clinical features described in the newborn are characteristic of Down syndrome (Trisomy 21). These features include a sloping forehead, flat nasal bridge, increased interocular distance, low-set ears, protruding tongue, single palmar crease, increased gap between the first and second toe, and Brushfield spots (small white and brown spots in the iris). The abdominal x-ray findings suggest duodenal atresia, which is also associated with Down syndrome. 

Down syndrome is commonly associated with congenital heart defects, the most characteristic of which is an atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD). While other cardiac anomalies can occur in Down syndrome, AVSD is the most classic and frequently associated defect.",9
4184,"The patient has β-thalassemia major and receives frequent blood transfusions, which can lead to iron overload due to the body's inability to excrete excess iron. This condition is known as secondary hemochromatosis. In the liver, iron overload is characterized by the accumulation of hemosiderin, an iron-storage complex. Hemosiderin appears as golden-yellow granules within macrophages and hepatocytes when stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and can be confirmed with Prussian blue staining, which specifically stains iron deposits. Therefore, the liver biopsy would most likely show macrophages with cytoplasmic granules that stain golden-yellow with hematoxylin, indicative of hemosiderin deposition due to iron overload.",9
4193,"The patient is an 8-year-old boy with a limp favoring his right leg, decreased range of motion of the left hip, and mild tenderness in the left lumbar region. The limp has been present for 6 months without complaint, which suggests a chronic condition. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) typically occurs in adolescents and is associated with obesity, which is not the case here. Developmental dysplasia of the hip is usually diagnosed in infants. Viral-induced synovitis, or transient synovitis, is typically acute and self-limiting, often following a viral infection, but this patient has had symptoms for 6 months. Legg-Calve-Perthes disease is a condition that affects children between 4 and 10 years old, characterized by avascular necrosis of the femoral head, leading to hip pain and limping over a prolonged period. This fits the patient's age and chronic presentation.",9
4096,"The patient's symptoms suggest a manic episode characterized by irritable mood, decreased need for sleep, increased energy, distractibility, and impulsive spending. These symptoms have lasted for 5 days. She also has a history of depressive episodes, where she experienced fatigue, hypersomnia, excessive crying, indecisiveness, and feelings of worthlessness. The presence of a manic episode (lasting at least 1 week or requiring hospitalization) is necessary for a diagnosis of Bipolar I disorder. However, in this case, the duration of the manic symptoms is 5 days, which may suggest a hypomanic episode. Bipolar II disorder involves hypomanic episodes and major depressive episodes. The history of depressive episodes and current hypomanic symptoms align with Bipolar II disorder. Major depressive disorder does not account for the current hypomanic symptoms, and substance abuse is unlikely given the history provided and normal vital signs.",9
4101,"The patient is a 17-year-old girl with recurrent, cyclic abdominal pain occurring mid-cycle, which is consistent with ovulatory pain (mittelschmerz). Her menstrual cycles are regular, and there are no abnormalities on examination or pregnancy. Given the cyclic nature of the pain and its timing in relation to her menstrual cycle, this is likely ovulatory pain, a benign condition. The most appropriate management for this condition is reassurance, as it is self-limiting and typically does not require further intervention. Imaging or hormonal treatment is not indicated at this stage without further indication of pathology.",9
4225,"The clinical presentation and MRI findings are suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS), a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. The key features include ataxic gait, hearing deficits, tonic gaze deviation, and the presence of multiple lesions with high T2 signal intensity on MRI. The CSF findings show an elevated leukocyte count and increased gamma globulin, which are consistent with MS. The mechanism of MS involves an autoimmune response where T-cells attack myelin sheaths in the CNS. This is a cell-mediated immune response, characteristic of Type IV hypersensitivity. Type II hypersensitivity involves antibody-mediated cytotoxicity, Type III involves immune complex deposition, and Type V involves stimulatory antibodies, none of which fit the pathophysiology of MS.",9
4260,"The patient's symptoms of muscle stiffness, myalgia, weight gain, cold dry skin, and delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes are suggestive of hypothyroidism. The elevated creatine kinase level and proximal muscle weakness further support this suspicion, as hypothyroidism can lead to myopathy with elevated CK levels. The most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis of hypothyroidism is to perform thyroid function tests, which typically include TSH and free T4 levels.",9
4275,"The patient presents with a loss of proprioception and vibration sense in the right leg, while motor strength and sensation in the left leg are normal. This suggests a lesion affecting the dorsal columns on the right side, which carry proprioceptive and vibration sense. The dorsal columns are supplied by the posterior spinal arteries. The lateral corticospinal tract, responsible for motor function, is intact as motor strength is normal. The artery of Adamkiewicz supplies the lower thoracic and upper lumbar regions of the spinal cord, primarily affecting motor function if compromised, which is not the case here. The dorsal root would affect sensory input but not specifically proprioception and vibration sense alone. Therefore, the posterior spinal artery is the most likely structure affected, leading to the specific sensory deficits observed.",9
4279,"The patient presents with acute onset aphasia and right-sided weakness, suggesting a left middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke. The symptoms started 5 hours ago. The CT scan is unremarkable, which is typical for an ischemic stroke in the early hours. The key decision point is the time window for treatment. IV tPA is typically administered within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. Since the patient is beyond this window, IV tPA is not an option. Mechanical thrombectomy is considered for large vessel occlusions within 6 hours of symptom onset, and sometimes up to 24 hours in select cases. Given the acute presentation and the time frame, mechanical thrombectomy is the best option if a large vessel occlusion is confirmed on imaging. Aspirin is used for secondary prevention but is not the immediate treatment for acute ischemic stroke in this scenario. Mannitol is used for reducing intracranial pressure, which is not indicated here.",9
4292,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest a hematological disorder. The child has fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, petechiae, and splenomegaly, along with pancytopenia (anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia). These findings are consistent with bone marrow infiltration or suppression. The peripheral blood smear would likely show blasts if acute leukemia is present. Given the age of the child and the presentation, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a common diagnosis. Bacterial sepsis could cause similar symptoms but would not typically cause such profound pancytopenia without other signs of infection. Burkitt’s lymphoma usually presents with a mass and is less likely to cause pancytopenia. Infectious mononucleosis can cause lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly but is less likely to cause severe pancytopenia. Therefore, the best explanation for these findings is acute lymphoid leukemia.",9
4293,"The infant presents with a scrotal mass that transilluminates and increases in size when crying, which is indicative of a communicating hydrocele. A hydrocele occurs when there is fluid accumulation around the testicle. In infants, this is often due to a patent processus vaginalis, which allows peritoneal fluid to enter the scrotum. The fact that the mass is reducible and increases in size with crying suggests a communication with the peritoneal cavity, consistent with a patent processus vaginalis. Other options such as lack of testicular fixation, germ cell neoplasia, or sperm collection in the epididymal duct do not fit the presentation of a transilluminating, reducible scrotal mass in an infant.",9

4357,"The patient presents with hypercalcemia, as indicated by the elevated serum calcium level of 12.8 mg/dL. The elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) level suggests primary hyperparathyroidism. The decreased calcitriol and renal insufficiency (elevated creatinine) are also noted. The patient is symptomatic with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, which are common in hypercalcemia. Initial management of severe hypercalcemia includes rehydration with intravenous saline and administration of calcitonin to rapidly lower calcium levels. Bisphosphonates are used to inhibit bone resorption and are appropriate for longer-term management of hypercalcemia, especially in cases related to malignancy or primary hyperparathyroidism. Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, bisphosphonates are the most appropriate next step after initial management with saline and calcitonin.",9
4363,"The patient has a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and is presenting with symptoms that suggest a progression of his condition. MDS can transform into acute myeloid leukemia (AML), especially given the patient's leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count). The presence of petechiae and purpura indicates bleeding tendencies, which are consistent with thrombocytopenia. The enlarged lymph nodes and crackles in the lungs could be due to infection or leukemic infiltration. The fever and productive cough suggest a possible infection, but the underlying hematologic changes are more indicative of a transformation to AML rather than a new primary cancer or lymphoma. Burkitt lymphoma and small cell lung cancer are less likely given the patient's history and current hematologic findings. Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema does not explain the leukocytosis and lymphadenopathy.",9
4278,"The presentation of a spontaneous hemarthrosis in a 2-year-old boy with no significant past medical history is suggestive of a bleeding disorder, most likely hemophilia. Hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) and hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency) are the most common causes of such presentations in young boys, as they are X-linked recessive disorders. The appropriate treatment for hemophilia A is the administration of factor VIII concentrates. Desmopressin (DDAVP) can be used in mild cases of hemophilia A to increase factor VIII levels, but it is not used for hemophilia B. Given the options, Desmopressin (option C) is the treatment that aligns with the management of hemophilia A, which is the most likely diagnosis given the presentation of hemarthrosis in this child.",9

4364,"The vaccine described involves a polysaccharide conjugated to a carrier protein. This type of vaccine is designed to enhance the immune response to polysaccharide antigens, which are typically found on the surface of bacteria. Conjugate vaccines are particularly important for young children, who do not respond well to polysaccharide antigens alone. 

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a bacterium with a polysaccharide capsule, and the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) is designed to protect against it by conjugating the polysaccharide to a protein carrier. This enhances the immunogenicity of the vaccine in young children.

Hepatitis A virus and Varicella zoster virus are viruses, and their vaccines do not involve polysaccharide conjugation. Bordetella pertussis is a bacterium, but the pertussis vaccine is not a conjugate vaccine; it is an acellular vaccine containing inactivated pertussis toxin and other components.

Therefore, the pathogen targeted by the polysaccharide conjugate vaccine is most likely Streptococcus pneumoniae.",9
4374,"The primary endpoint in the study is death from any cause. The mortality rate in the eplerenone group is 14.4% (0.144) and in the placebo group is 16.7% (0.167). To calculate the number needed to treat (NNT) to save one life, we use the formula NNT = 1 / (control event rate - experimental event rate). Here, the control event rate is 0.167 and the experimental event rate is 0.144. Therefore, the NNT is 1 / (0.167 - 0.144).",10
4367,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones), including severe flank pain, fever, chills, and hematuria. The CT scan shows ring shadows in the medullae of the kidney, which are indicative of medullary nephrocalcinosis. This condition can be associated with certain types of kidney stones, particularly those related to hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria. The patient's history of taking vitamin supplements and over-the-counter pain medicine is relevant. Specifically, excessive use of certain pain medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can lead to analgesic nephropathy, which is associated with renal papillary necrosis and may contribute to nephrocalcinosis. Therefore, the pain medicine is the most likely contributor to the development of this patient's condition.",9

4405,"The patient presents with iron deficiency anemia, positive stool occult blood, and a colonoscopy finding of an irregular, bleeding exophytic ulcer in the right colon, which is suggestive of colorectal cancer. The question asks for the lesion that is the greatest risk factor for this condition. Among the options, villous adenomatous polyps have the highest risk of malignant transformation compared to other types of polyps. Tubular adenomas have a lower risk, and hyperplastic polyps are generally considered benign with minimal risk of malignancy. Submucosal lipomatous polyps are benign and not associated with cancer risk. Therefore, the villous adenomatous polyp is the greatest risk factor for colorectal cancer.",9
4384,"The patient presents with unilateral leg swelling that began after travel to Kenya, along with non-pitting edema and skin changes such as roughness and induration. These symptoms are characteristic of lymphedema. The travel history to Kenya is significant because it suggests possible exposure to filarial infections, which are endemic in certain regions and can lead to lymphatic obstruction. The non-pitting nature of the edema and the skin changes further support a lymphatic cause rather than a venous one. Persistent elevation of venous pressures and venous thromboembolism typically cause pitting edema and are less likely to cause the described skin changes. Lymphatic hypoplasia is a congenital condition and would not present suddenly after travel. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is obstruction of lymphatic channels, likely due to filariasis.",9
4416,"The patient is being treated with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir. Each of these medications has specific adverse effects associated with them. Lamivudine is generally well-tolerated but can cause pancreatitis, especially in children. Zidovudine is known for causing bone marrow suppression, leading to anemia and neutropenia. Indinavir, a protease inhibitor, is associated with nephrolithiasis (urolithiasis) due to crystallization of the drug in the renal tubules. Given the options, indinavir is most likely to cause urolithiasis, which is the greatest risk among the listed adverse effects for this patient.",9
4411,"The patient presents with nephrotic syndrome, characterized by frothy urine, significant proteinuria (4.8 g/24 hours), and generalized edema. She has a history of rheumatoid arthritis and is on Penicillamine and Methotrexate. The urinalysis shows proteinuria and fat globules, consistent with nephrotic syndrome. The renal biopsy reveals diffuse capillary and glomerular basement membrane thickening.

Penicillamine is known to cause membranous nephropathy, which is characterized by thickening of the glomerular basement membrane without significant hypercellularity. This aligns with the biopsy findings. Minimal change disease and lipoid nephrosis typically do not show thickening of the basement membrane on biopsy. Diabetic glomerulonephropathy is unlikely given the patient's age, lack of significant hyperglycemia, and the specific biopsy findings.

Therefore, the most likely cause of her impaired renal function, given her medication history and biopsy findings, is membranous nephropathy due to Penicillamine use.",9
4432,"The newborn presents with central cyanosis, a holosystolic murmur, and a single second heart sound, which are suggestive of a congenital heart defect. The chest X-ray shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette with a narrowed mediastinum, which is characteristic of transposition of the great arteries (TGA). TGA is more common in infants of diabetic mothers due to the teratogenic effects of maternal hyperglycemia during pregnancy. Therefore, the most likely finding in the mother would be elevated hemoglobin A1c, indicating poorly controlled diabetes during pregnancy.",9
4478,"The question involves identifying the most likely target for a new antibody against HIV envelope proteins. The HIV envelope proteins are crucial for the virus's ability to infect host cells. Among the options provided:

- **gp120**: This is an envelope glycoprotein on the surface of the HIV virus. It plays a critical role in the virus's ability to attach to and enter host cells by binding to the CD4 receptor and a co-receptor (such as CCR5 or CXCR4) on the surface of T cells.

- **CXCR4**: This is not a viral protein but a co-receptor on the host cell that HIV uses to enter the cell. It is not a target for antibodies against the virus itself.

- **p24**: This is a core protein of HIV, part of the capsid, and is not an envelope protein.

- **p17**: This is a matrix protein of HIV, also not an envelope protein.

Since the question specifies targeting the HIV envelope proteins, gp120 is the correct choice as it is directly involved in the virus's ability to infect host cells and is a common target for neutralizing antibodies.",9
4467,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of bronchiolitis, commonly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants. The symptoms include wheezing, increased respiratory rate, and retractions, along with a preceding upper respiratory tract infection. The infant is stable with an oxygen saturation of 95% on room air and is playing, indicating that he is not in severe respiratory distress. Therefore, aggressive interventions like intubation are not necessary. Antibiotics are not indicated as this is likely a viral infection. A chest radiograph is not immediately necessary unless there is suspicion of a complication or alternative diagnosis. The most appropriate management for mild to moderate bronchiolitis is supportive care, which includes monitoring the child for any signs of worsening respiratory distress or hypoxia.",9
4493,"Omalizumab is a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of moderate to severe persistent allergic asthma. It works by targeting IgE antibodies. Specifically, omalizumab binds to the Fc region of circulating IgE antibodies, preventing them from binding to the high-affinity IgE receptors (FcεRI) on mast cells and basophils. This action reduces the release of inflammatory mediators from these cells, which are responsible for the symptoms of asthma and allergic reactions. Therefore, the mechanism of action of omalizumab is best described by option B.",9
4510,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of Paget's disease of bone, characterized by abnormal bone remodeling. The patient's symptoms, including bone pain, hearing loss, and changes in hat size, align with this condition. The bone scan showing diffuse uptake in the calvarium and other bones supports increased osteoblastic activity. In Paget's disease, there is increased bone turnover, leading to elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatase due to increased osteoblastic activity. Therefore, the expected laboratory abnormality is increased serum alkaline phosphatase.",9
4532,"The patient's symptoms of insomnia and anxiety, along with her report of taking extra doses of her medication to achieve an anxiolytic effect, suggest that she was likely prescribed a medication with a potential for tolerance and dependence. Hydroxyzine (A) is an antihistamine with sedative properties, but it is not typically associated with tolerance or dependence. Buspirone (B) is an anxiolytic that does not cause sedation or dependence, and it takes several weeks to become effective, so it is unlikely to be the medication she is taking extra doses of for immediate relief. Propranolol (C) is a beta-blocker used for performance anxiety and does not cause dependence. Triazolam (D) is a short-acting benzodiazepine used for insomnia, which can cause tolerance and dependence, leading patients to take extra doses for increased effect. Given the patient's behavior of taking extra doses for anxiolytic effect, Triazolam is the most likely medication prescribed.",9
4535,"The patient has a solitary calcified nodule in the left hilar region, which is confirmed to be 0.5 cm on CT. The nodule is calcified and small, which often suggests a benign etiology, such as a granuloma from a prior infection. Given the size and calcification, the risk of malignancy is low. In such cases, the standard management is to monitor the nodule over time to ensure it does not grow, which would suggest a benign process. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to repeat the chest CT scan in 6 months to monitor for any changes in size or characteristics of the nodule.",9

4464,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a condition affecting platelet function or number, such as Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) or Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP). The diffuse petechiae and low platelet count point towards thrombocytopenia. The prolonged bleeding time is consistent with decreased platelet function.

In ITP, there is immune-mediated destruction of platelets, which would correspond to answer B. However, ITP typically does not have increased bleeding time or petechiae at such platelet count levels unless it's chronic or severe.

In TTP, you can have normal or slightly elevated platelet counts with symptoms due to platelet consumption. TTP is characterized by normal platelet aggregation on a smear but increased von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimers due to decreased ADAMTS13 enzyme activity. This leads to the aggregation of platelets as long strands of vWF facilitate excessive clotting and consumption of platelets.

Given the fact that the patient's lab results do not indicate increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which would be elevated in TTP due to hemolytic anemia, this scenario is less likely. However, TTP would cause increased vWF multimers.

Considering all these factors and the available options, it seems that the increased vWF multimers in TTP align most closely with the symptoms and findings presented.",7
4559,"The clinical presentation of this 4-year-old girl suggests cystic fibrosis. Key features include failure to thrive despite a good appetite, frequent bulky and foul-smelling stools (steatorrhea), recurrent sinusitis, and respiratory symptoms. These symptoms are indicative of malabsorption due to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, which is common in cystic fibrosis. The pancreatic insufficiency leads to poor digestion and absorption of nutrients, particularly fats, resulting in the described stools and failure to thrive. The recurrent respiratory infections and sinusitis are also consistent with cystic fibrosis. Other options such as impaired intestinal amino acid transport, gluten intolerance, or Whipple's disease do not fit the overall clinical picture as well as exocrine pancreatic insufficiency does in the context of cystic fibrosis.",9
4567,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), characterized by fatigue, weight loss, splenomegaly, and a markedly elevated leukocyte count with a left shift (increased immature myeloid cells). The laboratory findings show a high leukocyte count with a predominance of myeloid cells at various stages of maturation, which is typical for CML. The presence of basophilia and thrombocytosis also supports this diagnosis. The history of a testicular tumor treated with radiation therapy could be a risk factor for secondary malignancies, including CML. Molecular testing likely confirmed the presence of the BCR-ABL fusion gene, which is pathognomonic for CML. The most appropriate treatment for CML, especially in the chronic phase, is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor such as imatinib, which specifically targets the BCR-ABL fusion protein.",9
4579,"The patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with acute gout, characterized by the sudden onset of pain, swelling, and erythema in the great toe, along with elevated uric acid levels and the presence of negatively birefringent crystals in the synovial fluid. The long-term management of gout typically involves reducing uric acid levels to prevent future attacks. The most common medication used for this purpose is allopurinol, which works by inhibiting xanthine oxidase, an enzyme involved in the production of uric acid. This reduces the synthesis of uric acid, thereby lowering its levels in the blood and preventing gout attacks.",9
4537,"The patient's symptoms of constipation, abdominal pain, increased urinary frequency, and increased thirst, along with the lab findings of hypercalcemia (high calcium levels), decreased PTH, and increased phosphate, suggest a condition associated with elevated calcium levels. Hypercalcemia with low PTH suggests a non-parathyroid cause. Increased ionized calcium and hyperphosphatemia are not typical of primary hyperparathyroidism (which would show increased PTH). The low PTH and hypercalcemia are more indicative of a paraneoplastic syndrome or vitamin D-related disorder. Vitamin overdose, specifically hypervitaminosis D, can cause increased calcium levels, decreased PTH due to negative feedback, and increased phosphate, as vitamin D increases intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. Vitamin D overdose (Vitamin A overdose would not cause these electrolyte changes) is consistent with taking vitamin supplements. Hence, vitamin overdose (hypervitaminosis D) fits the clinical picture.",9
4547,"The patient's symptoms and radiographic findings are consistent with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which is characterized by symmetric arthritis, particularly affecting the small joints of the hands and wrists. The morning stiffness, fatigue, and low-grade fever also support this diagnosis. RA is primarily mediated by autoantibodies and immune complexes that lead to inflammation and joint damage. The mechanism involves the formation of immune complexes (Type III hypersensitivity) and the recruitment of inflammatory cells, including T-cells, which contribute to the chronic inflammation seen in RA. Therefore, the correct mechanism of her reaction is a Type III–immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction.",9
4593,"The ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) is the connection between the renal pelvis and the ureter. If the UPJ fails to recanalize, it can lead to an obstruction at this junction. This obstruction prevents urine from flowing from the renal pelvis into the ureter, causing urine to accumulate in the renal pelvis. This accumulation of urine leads to dilation of the renal pelvis, a condition known as hydronephrosis. Since the abnormality is detected in the right kidney, the hydronephrosis would be unilateral, affecting only the right side. Therefore, the most likely finding on fetal ultrasound would be unilateral hydronephrosis.",9
4605,"The child presents with difficulty swallowing and a white lesion on the tongue and oropharynx. He was recently diagnosed with asthma and has been using an inhaler, which could be a corticosteroid inhaler. The use of inhaled corticosteroids can lead to oral thrush, a fungal infection caused by Candida species. The absence of fever, cough, or pain during swallowing, along with the description of a white lesion, supports the diagnosis of oral thrush. Leukoplakia and oral hairy leukoplakia are less likely in this age group and context. Primary gingivostomatitis is typically associated with herpes simplex virus and presents with painful oral lesions and systemic symptoms, which are not present here.",9
4600,"The patient presents with a history of a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, recurrent headaches, dizziness, and neurological findings such as dysarthria and hyperreflexia. The CT scan shows four brain lesions. Given her history of travel to Ecuador and the presence of multiple brain lesions, neurocysticercosis is a likely diagnosis. Neurocysticercosis is caused by the ingestion of eggs from the tapeworm Taenia solium, often through contaminated food. Therefore, avoiding contaminated food would have prevented the ingestion of the eggs and subsequent development of neurocysticercosis.",9
4655,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a musculoskeletal cause for his chest pain, likely due to costochondritis or a similar condition. The pain is localized and worsens with deep breaths, and there is tenderness on palpation, which are typical signs of musculoskeletal chest pain. The recent increase in physical activity (training for a hockey tournament) supports this diagnosis. The chest X-ray is likely normal, as musculoskeletal chest pain does not typically show abnormalities on imaging. Given these considerations, the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy is an NSAID to address inflammation and pain. Naproxen, an NSAID, is suitable for treating this type of pain. Alprazolam is an anxiolytic, alteplase is a thrombolytic, and heparin is an anticoagulant, none of which are appropriate for musculoskeletal chest pain.",9

4639,"The patient's symptoms include progressive memory loss, fatigue, poor concentration, ataxia, difficulty swallowing, and white plaques in the oropharynx. These symptoms, along with the white-grayish lesions seen on endoscopy, suggest an immunocompromised state, likely due to HIV infection. The presence of oral thrush (confluent white plaques) and esophageal candidiasis (streaky, white-grayish lesions) are common in individuals with HIV/AIDS. The neurological symptoms, including memory deficits and ataxia, are consistent with HIV-related encephalopathy, which can occur in advanced HIV infection. Other options like cerebral toxoplasmosis would typically present with focal neurological deficits and imaging findings, pseudodementia is more related to depression without the physical findings, and frontotemporal dementia would not explain the immunocompromised state and opportunistic infections.",9
4688,"The patient presents with symptoms and findings suggestive of coronary artery disease, specifically stable angina that has progressed to unstable angina, as indicated by the worsening and increasing frequency of episodes. The ECG shows ST-segment depression, which is indicative of subendocardial ischemia. The coronary angiography reveals significant narrowing of the left main coronary artery, which is a critical finding.

In the context of coronary artery disease, a mural thrombus is most likely to form in the left ventricle. This is because myocardial ischemia or infarction can lead to areas of hypokinesis or akinesis in the ventricular wall, creating conditions conducive to thrombus formation. The left ventricle is the most common site for mural thrombi in the setting of ischemic heart disease due to the high pressure and turbulent flow, especially if there is any degree of left ventricular dysfunction or aneurysm formation post-infarction.",9
4694,"The patient presents with symptoms of intermittent claudication, which is a common manifestation of peripheral artery disease (PAD). His risk factors include type 2 diabetes mellitus and a significant smoking history. The ABI of 0.80 confirms the diagnosis of PAD, as an ABI less than 0.90 is indicative of the disease. Initial management of intermittent claudication in PAD includes lifestyle modifications such as smoking cessation and exercise therapy. Pharmacologic therapy can also be initiated to improve symptoms. Cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, is the first-line pharmacologic treatment for intermittent claudication as it improves walking distance and alleviates symptoms. Endovascular revascularization is considered for more severe cases or when medical therapy fails. Duloxetine is used for neuropathic pain, and heparin is an anticoagulant used for acute thrombotic events, neither of which are appropriate for initial therapy in this context.",10
4691,"The clinical scenario describes a patient who likely developed aspiration pneumonia following an episode of coughing while eating. The progression to bilateral opacities and worsening oxygenation despite supplemental oxygen suggests the development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). In ARDS, there is damage to the alveolar-capillary membrane, leading to increased permeability and pulmonary edema. This results in impaired gas exchange and ventilation-perfusion mismatch, specifically an increased pulmonary shunt fraction. A shunt occurs when blood passes through the lungs without being oxygenated, which is characteristic of ARDS due to the presence of fluid-filled alveoli. The other options do not align with the pathophysiology of ARDS: increased pulmonary wedge pressure is more indicative of cardiogenic pulmonary edema, increased mixed venous oxygen saturation is not typical in ARDS, and decreased pulmonary artery pressure is not associated with ARDS.",9
4713,"The patient's laboratory findings and symptoms are consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism. This condition is characterized by hypercalcemia, elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH), low phosphorus, and elevated alkaline phosphatase. The elevated 24-hour urine calcium level and history of kidney stones further support this diagnosis. In primary hyperparathyroidism, one of the classic radiologic findings is subperiosteal bone resorption, particularly on the radial aspect of the middle phalanges of the index and middle fingers, which can be seen on hand X-rays.",9

4768,"The patient is currently on metformin and has shown some improvement in HbA1c from 8.2% to 7.2%, but further control is needed. The physician wants to add a medication that does not cause weight gain. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are thiazolidinediones, which can cause weight gain, so they are not suitable choices. Glyburide is a sulfonylurea, which can also cause weight gain. Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which does not typically cause weight gain and is suitable for this patient.",9

4772,"The patient presents with hypercalcemia (elevated calcium level of 12.2 mg/dL) and normal parathyroid hormone levels, suggesting a non-parathyroid-related cause of hypercalcemia. The weight loss, elevated creatinine, and bone pain suggest a possible malignancy, such as multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is characterized by increased bone resorption, leading to hypercalcemia, renal impairment, and bone pain. The increased urinary calcium is consistent with hypercalcemia. The most accurate diagnostic test for multiple myeloma is a bone marrow biopsy, which would show clonal plasma cells. Radiographs may show lytic bone lesions, but they are not as definitive as a bone marrow biopsy for diagnosis.",9
4708,"The patient presents with hypercalcemia (serum calcium of 14 mg/dL) and hypophosphatemia (serum phosphorus of 1.5 mg/dL), along with a compression fracture and osteopenia. These findings suggest increased bone resorption. The most common cause of hypercalcemia with hypophosphatemia is primary hyperparathyroidism, which leads to increased osteoclastic activity and bone resorption due to elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH increases bone resorption by increasing the expression of RANKL, which binds to RANK on osteoclast precursors, promoting their differentiation into active osteoclasts. Therefore, the underlying cause of decreased bone mineral density in this case is likely related to increased RANKL activity due to primary hyperparathyroidism. However, none of the answer choices directly mention RANKL activity. The closest option related to increased bone resorption is an increase in interleukin-1 secretion, which can also stimulate osteoclast activity and bone resorption.",9
4798,"The clinical presentation suggests Prader-Willi syndrome, characterized by hypotonia, hyperphagia leading to obesity, developmental delays, and hypogonadism. The child also has cryptorchidism and short stature. Growth hormone deficiency is common in Prader-Willi syndrome, and growth hormone therapy can help improve height, body composition, and possibly cognitive function. Testosterone may be used to address hypogonadism. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management, in addition to calorie restriction, is growth hormone and testosterone therapy.",9
4779,"The patient's symptoms and the description of the bacteria suggest an infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is known to grow on MacConkey agar and is oxidase-positive. Pseudomonas infections are commonly associated with exposure to water, particularly in environments like swimming pools or hot tubs. The rash and pruritus, along with the bacterial characteristics, align with a condition known as ""hot tub folliculitis,"" which is caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Therefore, the greatest risk factor for this condition is exposure to contaminated water, such as swimming in a pool.",9
4819,"The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of smoking, COPD, coronary artery disease, and hypertension. He has a BMI of 32.5 kg/m2, indicating obesity. His medical history includes a venous clot and resected colon polyps. His current medications include albuterol, atenolol, lisinopril, and aspirin. 

Given his age and smoking history, he is at risk for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The USPSTF recommends one-time screening for AAA with ultrasonography in men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked. This patient fits the criteria for this screening due to his smoking history.

Pulmonary function testing (A) is not a routine screening test and is more diagnostic or for monitoring COPD. A CT scan of the chest (C) is not indicated without specific symptoms or risk factors for lung cancer beyond his smoking history. Bone densitometry (D) is generally recommended for women over 65 or men with specific risk factors for osteoporosis, which are not clearly present here.

Therefore, the most appropriate health maintenance recommendation is abdominal ultrasonography to screen for AAA.",9
4833,"The patient's symptoms are suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), characterized by symmetric joint pain, particularly in the hands, and morning stiffness that improves with activity. The weight loss could be associated with systemic inflammation. RA is most strongly associated with the HLA-DR4 allele. The other options are associated with different conditions: HLA-B27 is linked to ankylosing spondylitis and other spondyloarthropathies, HLA-DR2 is associated with multiple sclerosis and narcolepsy, and HLA-DR3 is linked to conditions like type 1 diabetes and systemic lupus erythematosus.",9

4857,"The clinical presentation and MRI findings suggest a posterior fossa tumor in a child, which is common for certain types of brain tumors. The key histological description provided is the presence of parallel bundles of cells with eosinophilic, corkscrew-like processes. This description is characteristic of Rosenthal fibers, which are typically found in pilocytic astrocytomas. Pilocytic astrocytomas are common in children and often occur in the cerebellum, which is part of the posterior fossa. The other options do not match the histological description as closely: Medulloblastomas are also common in the posterior fossa but have different histological features, craniopharyngiomas are usually suprasellar, and pinealomas are located in the pineal gland region.",9
4864,"The patient is a 17-year-old male who has been struck by a vehicle and presents with signs of hypovolemic shock (hypotension, tachycardia, cool skin, delayed capillary refill) and abdominal tenderness with guarding. These findings suggest possible intra-abdominal injury and bleeding. In the setting of trauma, the FAST exam is a rapid, non-invasive bedside ultrasound used to assess for free fluid (blood) in the peritoneal cavity, pericardium, and pleural spaces. It is the most appropriate next step to quickly evaluate for internal bleeding and guide further management. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is more invasive and less commonly used now due to the availability of FAST. Diagnostic laparoscopy and emergency laparotomy are more invasive procedures and are typically considered after initial imaging or if the patient is unstable and requires immediate surgical intervention. Given that the patient is currently stable enough for further assessment, the FAST exam is the best next step.",9

4868,"The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis, which is a communicable disease that poses a public health risk. Physicians are required by law to report certain infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, to public health authorities to ensure appropriate measures are taken to prevent the spread of the disease. While patient confidentiality is important, public health concerns take precedence in this situation. Therefore, the most appropriate initial action is to inform the local public health department of the diagnosis.",9
4914,"Red blood cells (RBCs) are unique in that they lack several organelles, including mitochondria, nuclei, and ribosomes. The synthesis of heme, a component of hemoglobin, requires mitochondria because several steps of the heme biosynthesis pathway occur within the mitochondria. Since mature RBCs lack mitochondria, they cannot synthesize new heme molecules. This explains why the red blood cells in the study are unable to regenerate new heme molecules after the destruction of hemoglobin.",9
4897,"To diagnose type 2 diabetes, the criteria include: a fasting blood glucose ≥126 mg/dL, a 2-hour plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL during an oral glucose tolerance test, a random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL with symptoms of hyperglycemia, or an HbA1c ≥6.5%. In this case, the patient's fasting blood glucose is 125 mg/dL, which does not meet the criteria for diabetes. The HbA1c is 6.3%, which also does not meet the criteria. However, the 2-hour glucose level after the oral glucose tolerance test is 201 mg/dL, which meets the criteria for diabetes. The random glucose level is 211 mg/dL, but the patient is asymptomatic, so this alone does not confirm diabetes. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that the patient has type 2 diabetes as diagnosed by his oral tolerance blood glucose.",9
4944,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of cyanide poisoning. The key findings include altered consciousness, headache, shortness of breath, cherry-red skin, and a severe metabolic acidosis with a high lactate level. Cyanide poisoning is known to inhibit cytochrome C oxidase (also known as complex IV) in the electron transport chain, leading to impaired cellular respiration and a shift to anaerobic metabolism, resulting in lactic acidosis. The high lactate level and metabolic acidosis are consistent with this mechanism. The other enzymes listed do not explain the combination of symptoms and laboratory findings as effectively as cytochrome C oxidase inhibition does.",9
4810,"The presentation of the rash, characterized by erythema and bullae on the hands and arms with sharply delineated, symmetrical distribution, suggests non-accidental injury rather than a medical condition. The description of the lesions, particularly the stripes of normal skin and symmetry, is more consistent with an external cause, such as immersion in a hot liquid, rather than a dermatological disease. Given this, it's crucial to consider the possibility of child abuse. In such cases, the primary concern is the safety of the child, and Child Protective Services should be notified to ensure proper investigation and protection if abuse is suspected. A forensic interview or speaking to the parents individually might be necessary later, but notifying Child Protective Services is the immediate priority to ensure timely action.",9
4948,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), characterized by sudden onset of severe abdominal pain radiating to the back, hypotension, and a pulsatile abdominal mass. The risk factors include hypertension and a history of smoking. The underlying mechanism of an AAA is primarily due to aortic wall stress, which leads to weakening and dilation of the aortic wall. This stress is exacerbated by hypertension and smoking, which contribute to the degeneration of the aortic wall and eventual aneurysm formation. Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism in this case is aortic wall stress.",9
4955,"The patient was admitted to the psychiatric ward and given an emergency medication to calm his agitation. Over the next few days, he developed symptoms consistent with Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), such as hyperthermia, autonomic instability, altered mental status, and muscle rigidity. NMS is a known side effect of antipsychotic medications, which work primarily by blocking dopamine receptors. The symptoms of NMS are due to dopamine blockade in the central nervous system. Therefore, the drug that most likely caused this condition is an antipsychotic, which acts by blocking dopamine receptors.",9
4976,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of celiac disease, including diarrhea, bloating, nausea, abdominal discomfort, fatigue, and iron deficiency anemia (low hemoglobin and ferritin levels). The positive IgA tissue transglutaminase antibody further supports this diagnosis. Although a biopsy is the gold standard for confirming celiac disease, the patient is unwilling to undergo the procedure. In such cases, the most appropriate next step is to initiate a gluten-free diet, which is the primary treatment for celiac disease and should alleviate her gastrointestinal symptoms.",9
4979,"The patient's symptoms and family history suggest Wilson's disease, a genetic disorder leading to copper accumulation in the body. Key features include neurological symptoms (difficulty walking, slurred speech, tremor), psychiatric symptoms (flat affect), and liver disease (hepatosplenomegaly). The grandfather's death from esophageal varices suggests liver cirrhosis, which can occur in Wilson's disease. The eye photograph likely shows Kayser-Fleischer rings, indicative of copper deposition. Wilson's disease is characterized by low serum ceruloplasmin concentration due to defective copper transport.",9
5013,"The clinical presentation of this 11-month-old boy suggests a primary immunodeficiency. The chronic diarrhea, multiple pyogenic infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia are indicative of a severe immunodeficiency. The key immunologic profile to consider here is the one associated with Hyper-IgM syndrome, which is characterized by a defect in class switching due to a problem with CD40 ligand or CD40. This results in normal or increased levels of IgM and decreased levels of IgA, IgG, and IgE. The recurrent infections and opportunistic infections like Pneumocystis jirovecii are consistent with this syndrome. Therefore, the immunologic profile that matches this condition is increased IgM and decreased IgA, IgG, and IgE.",9
4999,"The patient's symptoms are suggestive of myasthenia gravis, characterized by muscle weakness that worsens with activity and improves with rest. The test described involves administering a medication that temporarily improves muscle strength, which is indicative of myasthenia gravis. Edrophonium is a short-acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used in the Tensilon test to diagnose myasthenia gravis. The temporary improvement in symptoms after administration of the medication aligns with the use of edrophonium.",9
4998,"The patient is presenting with hematemesis likely due to esophageal varices secondary to alcoholic cirrhosis. He is also confused and disoriented, which raises concerns about his airway protection. In cases of active variceal bleeding, airway protection is crucial, especially if the patient is confused and at risk of aspiration. While intravenous octreotide is used to control variceal bleeding, the immediate concern is to secure the airway due to the risk of aspiration from ongoing vomiting and altered mental status. Therefore, the most appropriate initial step in management is to perform endotracheal intubation to protect the airway.",9

5036,"In cases of digit amputation, proper preservation of the amputated part is crucial for potential reattachment. The goal is to keep the tissue viable by preventing it from drying out or becoming too cold. Placing the thumb directly in a liquid like milk or saline (options A and B) is not advisable as it can cause tissue damage. Option D is incorrect because saving the thumb is important for possible reattachment. The best method is to wrap the thumb in saline-moistened, sterile gauze to keep it moist, then place it in a sterile bag. This bag should then be placed in a container with ice to keep it cool without direct contact with ice, which could cause frostbite. Therefore, option C is the correct choice.",9
5040,"The patient is experiencing a severe asthma exacerbation, as indicated by his inability to speak in full sentences, use of accessory muscles, and poor air movement. The arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.34, indicating acidosis, and a Pco2 of 44 mm Hg, which is normal but inappropriate in the context of an asthma exacerbation where hyperventilation would typically cause a low Pco2. This suggests impending respiratory failure due to fatigue. The Po2 is low at 54 mm Hg, and the O2 saturation is 87%, indicating significant hypoxemia. Despite initial treatments with albuterol, ipratropium, and steroids, the patient's confusion and disorientation suggest worsening respiratory status. Given these findings, the most appropriate next step is to secure the airway and provide mechanical ventilation to prevent respiratory arrest.",9
5023,"The patient has a history of recurrent first-trimester miscarriages and a positive VDRL with a negative FTA-ABS, which suggests a false-positive syphilis test. This is often associated with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), a condition that can cause recurrent miscarriages and is characterized by thrombosis and pregnancy complications. The lab results show a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), which is consistent with the presence of a lupus anticoagulant, a common finding in APS. The best management for preventing miscarriage in APS is anticoagulation therapy. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is commonly used to prevent thrombosis and improve pregnancy outcomes in patients with APS.",9
5058,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of an aortic dissection, given the chest pain radiating to the back, hypertension, and history of cocaine use (a risk factor for dissection). In aortic dissection, one common finding is asymmetric blood pressures in the upper extremities due to involvement of the aortic arch and its branches. The other options are less likely: a coronary artery thrombus or vasospasm would typically present with more localized chest pain and not radiate to the back, and a pulmonary artery thrombus (pulmonary embolism) would more likely present with respiratory symptoms and not the described pain pattern.",9
5080,"The patient's presentation is consistent with pemphigus vulgaris, an autoimmune blistering disorder. The key features include flaccid bullae, involvement of the oral mucosa, and a positive Nikolsky sign (formation of new blisters upon rubbing the skin). Pemphigus vulgaris is caused by autoantibodies against desmogleins, which are transmembrane proteins involved in cell-to-cell adhesion in the epidermis. These proteins are part of the desmosomes, which hold keratinocytes together. The autoantibodies are of the IgG type, leading to the loss of cell adhesion and blister formation. Therefore, the pathogenesis involves IgG against transmembrane proteins between cells.",9
5090,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest Lyme disease, which is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted by the Ixodes tick. The circular red rash described is likely erythema migrans, a characteristic feature of Lyme disease. The Ixodes tick is also known to transmit other pathogens, including Babesia microti, which causes babesiosis. Ehrlichia is transmitted by the Amblyomma tick, Rickettsia rickettsii by the Dermacentor tick, and Rickettsia typhi by fleas. Therefore, the pathogen transmitted by the same tick responsible for Lyme disease is Babesia microti.",9
5051,"The boy has a history of recurrent ear infections, respiratory tract infections, and pneumonia, which suggests an underlying issue with his immune system or respiratory system. Cystic fibrosis (A) is characterized by thick mucus leading to respiratory infections, but it often presents with gastrointestinal symptoms and failure to thrive, which are not mentioned here. Common variable immune deficiency (B) usually presents later in life, often in adolescence or adulthood. X-linked agammaglobulinemia (C) is a condition where there is a lack of B cells leading to recurrent bacterial infections, but it typically presents with absent tonsils and lymphoid tissue, which is not mentioned. Kartagener syndrome (D) is a type of primary ciliary dyskinesia characterized by recurrent respiratory infections due to impaired ciliary function, leading to poor clearance of mucus. It often includes situs inversus, which might be seen on the chest X-ray. Given the recurrent respiratory infections and ear infections, Kartagener syndrome is the most likely cause.",9
5093,"The patient's symptoms and the description of a facial rash with burning or stinging sensations suggest rosacea. Rosacea is a chronic skin condition characterized by facial redness, flushing, and sometimes acne-like lesions. The strongest predisposing factor for rosacea is alcohol consumption, as it can trigger flushing and exacerbate the condition. Cutibacterium colonization is more associated with acne vulgaris, lisinopril therapy is not a known trigger for rosacea, and filaggrin gene mutation is linked to atopic dermatitis, not rosacea.",9
5091,"The patient's symptoms include right-sided jaw pain that worsens with chewing, pain radiating to the ear, a cracking sound while eating, limited jaw opening, and facial muscle spasms. These symptoms are characteristic of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction. TMJ dysfunction often presents with pain that worsens with jaw movement, clicking or popping sounds, and restricted jaw movement. The headaches and muscle spasms can be secondary to the muscle strain and tension associated with TMJ dysfunction. The other options, such as dental abscess, infection of the mandible, and chronic sinus inflammation, do not typically present with the combination of jaw clicking, limited opening, and muscle spasms.",9
5102,"The clinical presentation of this patient, including recurrent respiratory infections, bulky foul-smelling stools, and failure to thrive, is suggestive of cystic fibrosis. The autopsy findings of bronchial mucus plugging and bronchiectasis further support this diagnosis. Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which is located on chromosome 7. The most common mutation is the deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (ΔF508). This mutation leads to defective chloride channels, resulting in thick mucus secretions in the lungs and digestive tract. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is the deletion of the phenylalanine codon on chromosome 7.",9
5116,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with organophosphate poisoning, which is common in agricultural settings due to pesticide exposure. Organophosphates inhibit acetylcholinesterase, leading to an accumulation of acetylcholine at synapses. This results in overstimulation of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. The cardiac manifestations, such as bradycardia and AV block, are due to the activation of M2-cholinergic receptors in the heart. M2 receptors, when activated, decrease heart rate and conduction velocity through the AV node, leading to bradycardia and AV block. Therefore, the cardiac symptoms are due to the activation of M2-cholinergic receptors.",9
5122,"The patient presented with hypotension and tachycardia, which improved after IV fluids, suggesting a possible volume depletion or hypovolemia. Given the history of a fall, there is concern for internal bleeding, especially considering the patient is on warfarin with an INR of 2.5, which indicates anticoagulation. The normal hemoglobin and hematocrit suggest no significant acute blood loss at this time. The improvement in vital signs with fluids suggests the patient is stable for now. The INR is therapeutic for a prosthetic valve, but if there is concern for bleeding, reversing anticoagulation could be considered. However, there is no direct evidence of bleeding or hemodynamic instability after fluid resuscitation. Imaging such as a CT scan is often the next step to identify any internal injuries or bleeding sources in a stable patient after trauma. Therefore, a CT scan is the best next step in management to assess for any internal injuries.",9

5130,"The patient's symptoms of intermittent severe headaches, palpitations, sweating, and pallor, along with hypertension and tachycardia, are suggestive of pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine-secreting tumor that can cause episodic symptoms due to excess production of epinephrine and norepinephrine. The first step in medical management is to control the hypertension and prevent hypertensive crises. Alpha-adrenergic blockade is initiated first to prevent unopposed alpha stimulation, which could worsen hypertension if beta-blockers are used first. Phenoxybenzamine, a non-selective alpha-adrenergic blocker, is typically used as the first-line treatment to manage the hypertension associated with pheochromocytoma.",9
5123,"The patient is 46 years old and had a normal Pap smear one year ago. Current guidelines recommend cervical cancer screening with a Pap smear every 3 years for women aged 21 to 65, or every 5 years with HPV co-testing for women aged 30 to 65. Therefore, a yearly Pap smear is not recommended (eliminating option B). Bone mineral density screening is typically recommended starting at age 65 unless there are specific risk factors, making option C unlikely. Colorectal cancer screening generally starts at age 50, so option D is also not recommended at this age. Blood glucose screening is recommended for adults aged 40 to 70 who are overweight or obese, which is a common recommendation for middle-aged adults, making option A the most appropriate.",9
5137,"To calculate the attributable risk percent, we first need to determine the incidence of lung cancer in both the exposed and unexposed groups. 

1. **Incidence in Exposed Group:**
   - Number of lung cancer cases in exposed group = 18
   - Total number of exposed individuals = 300
   - Incidence in exposed group = (18/300) = 0.06 or 6%

2. **Incidence in Unexposed Group:**
   - Number of lung cancer cases in unexposed group = 11
   - Total number of unexposed individuals = 500
   - Incidence in unexposed group = (11/500) = 0.022 or 2.2%

3. **Attributable Risk (AR):**
   - AR = Incidence in exposed - Incidence in unexposed = 0.06 - 0.022 = 0.038 or 3.8%

4. **Attributable Risk Percent (AR%):**
   - AR% = (AR / Incidence in exposed) * 100 = (0.038 / 0.06) * 100 = 63.3%

Therefore, the attributable risk percent for developing lung cancer over a 10-year period after radon exposure is 63.3%.",10
5143,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest acute rejection of the transplanted kidney. Acute rejection can be either antibody-mediated or cell-mediated. In this case, we are considering acute cell-mediated rejection, which is primarily driven by T lymphocytes. On biopsy, acute cell-mediated rejection is characterized by a lymphocytic infiltrate, particularly involving the tubules and interstitium of the kidney. This is due to the immune response against the transplanted tissue. Other options, such as sloughing of proximal tubular epithelial cells, drug precipitation, and granular immunofluorescence, are not characteristic of acute cell-mediated rejection. Sloughing of epithelial cells might suggest acute tubular necrosis, drug precipitation could indicate nephrotoxicity, and granular immunofluorescence is more indicative of antibody-mediated processes.",9
5152,"The patient's symptoms are indicative of a manic episode, characterized by decreased need for sleep, increased energy, distractibility, irritability, and erratic behavior. This is consistent with bipolar disorder, particularly bipolar I disorder, given the history of a major depressive episode. The strongest predisposing factor for bipolar disorder is genetic predisposition. Family history of bipolar disorder significantly increases the risk of developing the condition. While other factors like maternal obstetric complications and advanced paternal age can have some association with psychiatric conditions, they are not as strongly linked to bipolar disorder as genetic factors. Being married is not a known risk factor for bipolar disorder.",9

5146,"The patient presents with fever, confusion, and signs of meningeal irritation (involuntary flexion of the hips and knees with neck flexion), which are suggestive of meningitis. The CSF analysis shows a high leukocyte count with a predominance of neutrophils, elevated protein, and low glucose, which are indicative of bacterial meningitis. The patient's recent chemotherapy and immunocompromised state (due to non-Hodgkin lymphoma) increase the risk for infections, including those caused by Listeria monocytogenes. Listeria is a common cause of meningitis in immunocompromised individuals and requires specific coverage with ampicillin. Therefore, the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy should cover common bacterial causes of meningitis, including Listeria. The combination of vancomycin, ampicillin, and cefepime provides broad coverage for bacterial meningitis, including Listeria, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Gram-negative bacilli.",9
5147,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri. Key features include headache, visual disturbances, papilledema, and elevated opening pressure on lumbar puncture with normal CSF composition. The absence of a mass on MRI and the elevated opening pressure suggest increased intracranial pressure without a clear mass lesion. The most likely pathogenic mechanism in IIH is impaired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption, often due to elevated intracranial venous pressure, which leads to increased intracranial pressure. This is supported by the elevated opening pressure on lumbar puncture and the lack of other abnormalities.",9
5158,"The patient presents with jaundice, dark urine, pruritus, and abdominal pain after eating, which suggests obstructive jaundice. The lab findings show elevated conjugated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, indicating cholestasis. The ultrasound shows a normal gallbladder but an invisible common bile duct, suggesting a possible obstruction. A contrast CT is unremarkable, which might miss small stones or strictures. ERCP is both diagnostic and therapeutic for common bile duct obstructions, such as stones or strictures, and is the next best step to visualize and potentially relieve the obstruction.",9
5161,"The patient presents with proximal muscle weakness, difficulty swallowing, elevated creatine kinase, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. These findings are suggestive of an inflammatory myopathy, such as polymyositis or dermatomyositis. The elevated creatine kinase indicates muscle damage, and the elevated ESR suggests inflammation. Electromyography (EMG) is useful in diagnosing myopathies by showing characteristic patterns of muscle activity. A lumbar puncture is not indicated as there is no evidence of central nervous system involvement. The Tensilon test is used for myasthenia gravis, which typically presents with fluctuating weakness that improves with rest, unlike this case. Temporal artery biopsy is used for diagnosing giant cell arteritis, which does not fit this clinical picture. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is electromyography to further evaluate the muscle weakness.",9
5163,"The child presents with hearing loss, microcytic hypochromic anemia, and basophilic stippling on the peripheral smear. These findings, along with the history of living in an old house in Flint, Michigan, suggest lead poisoning. The Rinne test indicates sensorineural hearing loss, which can be associated with lead toxicity. The presence of basophilic stippling and the history of living in an area known for lead contamination further support this diagnosis. The most immediate and crucial step in managing suspected lead poisoning is to remove the child from the source of lead exposure to prevent further harm. While chelation therapy may be necessary if blood lead levels are high, the first step is to eliminate exposure.",9
5154,"The patient presents with fatigue, confusion, irritability, muscle and joint pain, and constipation. The lab results show microcytic anemia (low hemoglobin and hematocrit with low MCV). These symptoms and lab findings are consistent with heavy metal exposure, particularly lead poisoning, which can cause neurological symptoms, abdominal pain, and microcytic anemia. Iron deficiency also causes microcytic anemia but does not typically present with neurological symptoms like confusion and irritability. Systemic lupus erythematosus can cause a variety of symptoms but is less likely given the specific presentation and lab findings. Guillain-Barre syndrome primarily causes ascending muscle weakness and is not associated with microcytic anemia or the other symptoms described.",9
5166,"The patient had ARDS, which can lead to long-term pulmonary complications due to the damage and inflammation in the lungs. After ARDS, patients are at risk for developing interstitial lung disease (ILD) due to fibrosis and scarring from the inflammatory process. The presence of inspiratory crackles at discharge suggests some ongoing interstitial changes, which aligns with the development of ILD. Spontaneous pneumothorax, panacinar emphysema, and asthma are less likely to be direct long-term complications of ARDS. Therefore, the most likely long-term complication in this scenario is interstitial lung disease.",9
5169,"The patient's symptoms include getting tired early in the evening, going to bed around 9 PM, and waking up between 2 and 3 AM. She also experiences increased daytime sleepiness and takes naps. These symptoms are characteristic of a circadian rhythm sleep disorder, specifically advanced sleep phase disorder (ASPD). ASPD is characterized by an earlier than normal sleep onset and wake time, leading to early evening sleepiness and early morning awakening. The patient does not have difficulty falling asleep, which rules out insomnia. Her symptoms do not align with depressive disorder, as there is no mention of mood changes or other depressive symptoms. Delayed sleep phase disorder involves difficulty falling asleep and waking up late, which is the opposite of this patient's pattern. Non-REM sleep arousal disorders involve incomplete awakenings from sleep, such as sleepwalking or night terrors, which are not described here.",9
5164,"The patient's symptoms of aching pain and stiffness in the neck, shoulders, and hips, along with difficulty in rising from a seated position and raising her arms, are suggestive of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). PMR is characterized by pain and stiffness in the proximal muscles, but muscle strength is typically normal, which aligns with the physical examination findings. The presence of fatigue and chronic fevers also supports this diagnosis. In PMR, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is typically elevated due to systemic inflammation, while the serum creatinine kinase (CK) remains normal because there is no true muscle damage or myositis. Therefore, the expected laboratory findings would be an elevated ESR and a normal CK.",9
5171,"The patient is a 24-year-old woman at 35 weeks gestation presenting with regular contractions and cervical changes (60% effacement and 5 cm dilation), indicating she is in preterm labor. The contraction amplitude of 220 MVU suggests adequate uterine activity. At 35 weeks, the primary concern is to delay delivery to allow for further fetal maturation if possible. However, at this gestational age, the risks of preterm delivery are lower than at earlier gestational ages, and the use of tocolytics like terbutaline is generally not recommended beyond 34 weeks. Magnesium sulfate is used for neuroprotection in preterm infants less than 32 weeks gestation, not for tocolysis at 35 weeks. Oxytocin is used to augment labor, which is not needed here as the patient is already in active labor. Therefore, the most appropriate management is to allow labor to progress without pharmacotherapy.",9
5173,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of actinic keratosis, which is characterized by rough, sandpaper-like lesions on sun-exposed areas of the skin. This condition is common in individuals with significant sun exposure, such as those with outdoor occupations like gardening. Actinic keratosis is considered a precancerous lesion that can potentially progress to squamous cell carcinoma if left untreated. The description of the lesion as thin, adherent, and yellow-colored aligns with actinic keratosis. Therefore, the most likely condition to develop if this skin condition is left untreated is squamous cell carcinoma.",9
5179,"The infant in this scenario is presenting with symptoms consistent with infantile colic, characterized by episodes of inconsolable crying in an otherwise healthy and well-fed infant. The crying episodes are high-pitched and unprovoked, lasting for several hours, which is typical for colic. The infant is gaining weight appropriately and has a normal physical examination, indicating no underlying medical condition. In such cases, the most appropriate management is reassurance to the parents, as colic is a self-limiting condition that typically resolves by 3 to 4 months of age. Other options like simethicone, pantoprazole, or gripe water are not supported by strong evidence for effectiveness in treating colic.",9
5175,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of osteomyelitis, particularly in the context of his poorly-controlled diabetes and peripheral vascular disease. The exposed bone and the chronicity of the symptoms, along with systemic signs like fever and chills, support this diagnosis. In diabetic patients, especially those with peripheral vascular disease, Staphylococcus aureus is the most common causative organism of osteomyelitis. The other options are less likely: Mycobacterium tuberculosis typically causes chronic infections with a different presentation, Neisseria gonorrhoeae is associated with septic arthritis rather than osteomyelitis, and Pasteurella multocida is usually linked to animal bites, which the patient does not report.",9
5186,"The patient presents with acute rectal bleeding, easy bleeding during manicures, and a systolic murmur. These symptoms suggest a bleeding disorder. The murmur, along with bleeding tendencies, points towards a condition like von Willebrand disease, which is associated with aortic stenosis (Heyde's syndrome). The murmur at the right upper sternal border suggests aortic stenosis, which can be associated with von Willebrand factor deficiency due to increased shear stress leading to its degradation. This explains the bleeding tendency and the murmur. Therefore, the deficiency of von Willebrand factor is the most likely cause of this patient's condition.",9
5188,"The patient is pregnant and has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by E. coli, as indicated by the urine culture. In pregnant women, UTIs should be treated promptly to prevent complications such as pyelonephritis, which can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes. The most appropriate antibiotics for treating UTIs in pregnancy are those that are safe for both the mother and the fetus. Amoxicillin/clavulanate is a safe and effective choice for treating UTIs in pregnant women. Gentamicin is not typically used for uncomplicated UTIs in pregnancy due to potential nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Renal ultrasound and cystoscopy are not indicated in this scenario as the diagnosis is clear and the focus should be on treatment.",9
5194,"The patient presents with a chronic rash that has acutely worsened, characterized by silvery scaly plaques on extensor surfaces, which is highly suggestive of psoriasis. The involvement of more than 10% of the body surface area indicates moderate to severe psoriasis. Additionally, the patient reports early morning swelling of distal joints, which could suggest psoriatic arthritis. Given the severity of the skin involvement and the potential joint symptoms, systemic treatment is warranted. Methotrexate is a systemic treatment option for moderate to severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Phototherapy is also an option for moderate psoriasis but may not address joint symptoms. Infliximab is a biologic that could be used but is typically considered after methotrexate. A skin biopsy is not necessary as the clinical presentation is classic for psoriasis. Therefore, the next best step is to initiate methotrexate.",9
5135,,0
5189,"The patient's symptoms of progressive fatigue, shortness of breath, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea suggest heart failure. The presence of bilateral basilar rales indicates pulmonary congestion. The history of palpitations and heart pounding could be related to arrhythmias secondary to valvular heart disease. Given the history of intravenous drug use, there is a possibility of valvular damage, particularly affecting the left-sided heart valves. Mitral valve regurgitation can cause pulmonary congestion and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea due to backflow of blood into the left atrium, leading to increased pulmonary venous pressure. Aortic valve regurgitation can also cause heart failure symptoms, but it typically presents with a diastolic murmur and bounding pulses, which are not mentioned here. Aortic stenosis usually presents with exertional dyspnea, syncope, and angina, and is less likely given the symptoms described. Tricuspid regurgitation would cause systemic venous congestion rather than pulmonary congestion. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is mitral valve regurgitation.",9
5195,"The infant presents with cyanosis, a single S2, and a harsh systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border. The presence of a right ventricular lift suggests right ventricular hypertrophy. The single S2 indicates that there is likely only one semilunar valve closing, which is consistent with conditions where there is a significant outflow tract obstruction or abnormality. The displaced and hypoplastic thumb suggests a possible genetic syndrome, such as Holt-Oram syndrome, which is associated with cardiac defects. The combination of cyanosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, and a systolic ejection murmur is characteristic of Tetralogy of Fallot. This condition includes right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, ventricular septal defect, overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy, which aligns with the clinical findings.",9
5198,"The patient's presentation includes symmetric bilateral joint pain in the hands, knees, and ankles, which is worse in the morning and improves throughout the day. This pattern is suggestive of an inflammatory arthritis. The recent low-grade fever and malaise also support an inflammatory or infectious process. The key detail is that the joint pain resolved spontaneously within a month, which is not typical for chronic conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. Reactive arthritis usually follows an infection and is often associated with additional symptoms like conjunctivitis or urethritis, which are not mentioned here. Transient synovitis typically affects children and is more associated with hip pain. Parvovirus B19 infection can cause a self-limited arthritis, especially in adults, and is known to cause symmetric joint pain that resolves spontaneously. Given the patient's occupation as a school teacher, she may have been exposed to parvovirus from children. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is parvovirus infection.",9
5203,"The clinical presentation and findings suggest the child has neuroblastoma, a tumor that originates from neural crest cells. The symptoms of rapid eye movements and jerking movements are consistent with opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome, which can be associated with neuroblastoma. The abdominal mass crossing the midline and elevated urinary homovanillic acid (HVA) and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) further support this diagnosis. Neuroblastoma originates from neural crest cells, which also give rise to the enteric nervous system. Hirschsprung disease is a condition that results from the absence of ganglion cells in the distal colon, which are derived from neural crest cells. Therefore, Hirschsprung disease pathologically originates from the same type of cells as neuroblastoma.",9
5204,"The patient is likely being treated for tuberculosis, given the symptoms and chest x-ray findings. The standard treatment for tuberculosis includes isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. The requirement for monthly ophthalmologic examinations suggests monitoring for optic neuritis, a known adverse effect of ethambutol. Ethambutol works by impairing the synthesis of cell wall polysaccharides, specifically by inhibiting arabinosyl transferase, which is involved in the synthesis of the mycobacterial cell wall. Therefore, the mechanism of action related to the need for ophthalmologic exams is impaired synthesis of cell wall polysaccharides.",10
5209,"The patient presents with acute confusion, disorganized speech, and hallucinations, which are indicative of delirium. Delirium is often caused by medications, infections, or metabolic disturbances. In this case, the recent adjustment of her medications, particularly clomipramine (a tricyclic antidepressant), could contribute to anticholinergic delirium. Brain imaging in delirium typically shows no structural abnormalities, as it is a functional disorder. Therefore, the brain imaging would likely reveal a normal cerebrum.",9
5208,"In the context of an HIV-positive pregnant woman in labor, the goal is to reduce the risk of vertical transmission of HIV to the newborn. The standard practice is to administer intravenous zidovudine (AZT) during labor if the maternal viral load is not adequately suppressed. This woman has a viral load of 2,000 copies/mL, which is not considered adequately suppressed. Zidovudine is the recommended drug for intravenous administration during labor to reduce the risk of transmission. The other options listed are not used for this purpose during labor.",9
5220,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a pheochromocytoma, a catecholamine-secreting tumor usually located in the adrenal gland. The elevated urine and plasma metanephrines, along with the CT scan showing a mass in the left adrenal gland, support this diagnosis. The appropriate initial pharmacotherapy for pheochromocytoma is an alpha-adrenergic blocker to control hypertension and prevent hypertensive crises. Phenoxybenzamine, a non-selective, irreversible alpha-adrenergic antagonist, is commonly used for this purpose. Beta-blockers like propranolol should not be used initially because they can lead to unopposed alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation, worsening hypertension. Clonidine and hydrochlorothiazide are not appropriate initial treatments for pheochromocytoma.",9
5219,"The patient's pleural effusion needs to be classified as either a transudate or an exudate. The Light's criteria are used to differentiate between the two. According to Light's criteria, pleural fluid is considered an exudate if one or more of the following are true: 1) Pleural fluid protein/serum protein ratio > 0.5, 2) Pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH ratio > 0.6, 3) Pleural fluid LDH > two-thirds the upper limit of normal for serum LDH. 

In this case, the pleural fluid protein concentration is 4.0 g/dL. Assuming a normal serum protein level of around 7 g/dL, the pleural fluid protein/serum protein ratio would be approximately 0.57, which meets the criteria for an exudate. The pleural fluid LDH is 80 U/L, and without the serum LDH value, we cannot calculate the exact ratio, but the protein ratio is sufficient to classify it as an exudate.

Exudative effusions are typically caused by increased capillary permeability due to inflammation or infection, such as pneumonia, which aligns with the patient's symptoms of fever and shortness of breath. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's effusion is increased pulmonary capillary permeability due to an inflammatory process.",9
5218,"The patient presents with symptoms and findings suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), including excessive daytime sleepiness, loud snoring, gasping during sleep, obesity (BMI of 37 kg/m2), and oropharyngeal examination findings of a small orifice, enlarged tongue, uvula, and low-lying soft palate. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 8 episodes/h indicates mild OSA. The first-line treatment for OSA, especially when lifestyle modifications like weight loss and exercise are insufficient, is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). CPAP is effective in keeping the airway open during sleep, reducing apneas and hypopneas, and improving symptoms. Oral appliances and surgery are considered in specific cases, often when CPAP is not tolerated or effective. Supplemental oxygen is not a standard treatment for OSA as it does not address the airway obstruction.",9
5223,"The patient is at 37 weeks' gestation with a history of two previous cesarean sections and presents with sparse vaginal bleeding. She has had no prenatal care, which raises concerns about potential complications such as placenta previa or placental abruption. In this context, performing a pelvic examination could risk exacerbating bleeding if placenta previa is present. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to perform transvaginal sonography to assess the placental location and rule out placenta previa before any further examination or intervention.",9
5226,"The patient has a family history of various cancers and genetic testing shows mutations in MLH1 and MSH2, which are associated with Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, HNPCC). Lynch syndrome significantly increases the risk of colorectal cancer and other cancers, such as endometrial, ovarian, gastric, and small bowel cancers. Due to the increased risk of colorectal cancer, individuals with Lynch syndrome require more frequent and earlier screening. The standard recommendation for individuals with Lynch syndrome is to begin colonoscopy screening at an earlier age, typically between 20-25 years, and to repeat it every 1-2 years. Therefore, the patient will most likely require annual colonoscopy beginning at 20–25 years of age.",9
5230,"The patient's history of a pancreatic insulinoma and a pituitary tumor suggests the possibility of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1), also known as Wermer's syndrome. MEN 1 is characterized by the triad of pituitary tumors, pancreatic endocrine tumors (such as insulinomas), and parathyroid adenomas. Therefore, it would be prudent to consider testing for parathyroid adenoma in this patient.",9
5232,"The patient presents with signs of opioid overdose, which include decreased level of consciousness, respiratory depression (respirations at 8/min), and pinpoint pupils. These symptoms, along with his history of illicit drug use and the presence of track marks, strongly suggest opioid intoxication. In cases of suspected opioid overdose, the most appropriate immediate treatment is the administration of naloxone, an opioid antagonist, to reverse the effects of the opioids and improve respiratory function.",9
5234,"The patient is experiencing a febrile reaction immediately following a blood transfusion, along with oozing from IV sites, which suggests a hemolytic transfusion reaction. The clerical error in the blood bank indicates that the wrong blood type was likely given. In an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction, preformed antibodies in the recipient's blood react against antigens on the donor red blood cells. This is a type II hypersensitivity reaction, where IgM or IgG antibodies bind to the transfused red blood cells, leading to complement activation and hemolysis. The fever and hypotension are consistent with this reaction, and the oozing from IV sites could be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a complication of hemolytic reactions. Therefore, the mechanism is the presence of preformed antibodies reacting with the transfused blood.",9
5239,"The patient's symptoms and echocardiography findings are suggestive of a cardiac myxoma, which is a benign tumor often found in the left atrium. The mid-diastolic plopping sound is likely a ""tumor plop,"" characteristic of myxomas. These tumors can produce interleukin-6 (IL-6), leading to systemic symptoms such as fever and fatigue. The biopsy findings of mesenchymal cells in a gelatinous matrix are consistent with a myxoma. Therefore, the systemic symptoms are likely due to increased IL-6 levels.",9
5238,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of heart failure, likely due to ischemic heart disease, as indicated by the T wave inversions in leads V1 to V4 on the ECG. These findings, along with his history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes, suggest underlying coronary artery disease and possibly heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). In heart failure, certain medications are known to improve long-term survival. Beta-blockers, such as metoprolol, are one of these medications. They reduce mortality in patients with heart failure by decreasing heart rate, reducing myocardial oxygen demand, and preventing arrhythmias. Other options like gemfibrozil (a lipid-lowering agent), amlodipine (a calcium channel blocker), and dobutamine (a positive inotrope used acutely) do not have the same long-term survival benefit in heart failure as beta-blockers do.",9
5243,"The patient is experiencing a severe asthma exacerbation, as indicated by her severe shortness of breath, use of accessory muscles, and low oxygen saturation despite using her beta-agonist inhaler. In such cases, the immediate goal is to relieve bronchospasm and improve oxygenation. Inhaled albuterol (a beta-agonist) is the first-line treatment for acute asthma exacerbations. Although she has already used her inhaler, in a severe exacerbation, repeated doses or continuous nebulization of albuterol are often necessary. Intravenous corticosteroids are important for reducing inflammation but take several hours to work, so they are not the immediate next step. Ipratropium bromide can be used as an adjunct to albuterol in severe cases, but albuterol is prioritized. Theophylline is not typically used in acute settings due to its side effect profile and slower onset of action.",9
5242,"The patient is a 19-year-old male who is up to date on his vaccinations up to age 10 and received the Tdap and meningococcal vaccines at age 12. He recently received the influenza vaccine. The herpes zoster vaccine is not appropriate for his age group, as it is recommended for older adults. The tetanus and reduced diphtheria toxoid booster (Td) is typically given every 10 years, so he is not due for this yet since he received Tdap at age 12. The hepatitis A vaccine is not routinely recommended for all adolescents unless they are at increased risk or in certain geographic areas. The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is recommended for males and females starting at age 11 or 12 and can be given up to age 26 for males who have not been vaccinated previously. Given his age and the fact that he is sexually active, the HPV vaccine is the best recommendation.",9
5251,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a pattern of behavior consistent with dependent personality disorder. She exhibits a pervasive and excessive need to be taken care of, which leads to submissive and clinging behavior and fears of separation. This is evidenced by her inability to make decisions without excessive advice and reassurance from others, her reliance on her boyfriend for financial support, and her parents for arranging appointments and handling car maintenance. Her unease when alone and her behavior of going on multiple dates a week after her breakup further indicate her fear of being alone and need for support. These characteristics align with dependent personality disorder rather than the other options.",9
5207,"The patient presents with proximal muscle weakness and a rash on her face and hands, which are suggestive of dermatomyositis. Dermatomyositis is characterized by a heliotrope rash on the face and Gottron's papules or sign on the hands. The muscle weakness without sensory loss points towards a myopathic process rather than a neuropathic or neuromuscular junction disorder. The involvement of the skin and proximal muscles, along with the described rash, aligns with dermatomyositis, which is associated with elevated muscle enzymes like creatine kinase (CK) and specific autoantibodies. 

Given the symptoms, the more typical findings in dermatomyositis would include muscle biopsy showing perifascicular atrophy, but none of the options directly describe this. However, dermatomyositis can sometimes be associated with underlying malignancies, which may result in elevated tumor markers such as CA-125 in cases where ovarian cancer is present. This is the only option directly linked to dermatomyositis and its paraneoplastic potential.",9
5249,"The patient presents with severe left flank pain radiating to the groin, which is suggestive of a renal or ureteral issue. The urinalysis shows cola-colored urine with proteinuria and hematuria, which can indicate bleeding or damage within the urinary tract. The key finding here is the 'ring sign' on intravenous urography, which is characteristic of renal papillary necrosis. This condition can be associated with analgesic use, particularly those containing aspirin and caffeine, which the patient is taking for migraines. The combination of symptoms, urinalysis findings, and imaging results points towards renal papillary necrosis as the most likely cause.",9
5253,"The ATP7B gene mutation is associated with Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive disorder. For a child to develop an autosomal recessive condition, they must inherit two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent. Since both the patient and her husband are carriers, they each have one normal allele and one mutated allele. The possible genetic combinations for their offspring are: 25% chance of inheriting two normal alleles (unaffected, not a carrier), 50% chance of inheriting one normal and one mutated allele (carrier, but not affected), and 25% chance of inheriting two mutated alleles (affected by the condition). Therefore, there is a 25% chance that their offspring will develop Wilson's disease.",10
5245,"The patient is a 35-year-old woman with a family history of colon cancer in her father at age 70 and heart attacks in both parents. Her recent silicone breast implants do not affect cancer screening recommendations. For colon cancer screening, guidelines generally recommend starting at age 50 for average-risk individuals, but earlier if there is a family history of colorectal cancer in a first-degree relative diagnosed before age 60. However, her father was diagnosed at age 70, which does not necessitate earlier screening than the standard recommendation. For breast cancer screening, mammography is typically recommended starting at age 50 for average-risk women, unless there are specific risk factors or family history that warrant earlier screening. Given her age and the lack of specific risk factors for early breast cancer screening, the most appropriate initial step is to follow standard guidelines. Therefore, the correct answer is to schedule a mammography at age 50.",9
5270,"The patient's presentation includes agitation, bizarre behavior, hallucinations, and nystagmus. These symptoms are characteristic of phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication. PCP is known to cause agitation, hallucinations, and nystagmus (often horizontal or vertical). The patient's normal vital signs, except for mild hypertension, and the presence of nystagmus and drooling further support PCP intoxication. Cocaine intoxication typically presents with tachycardia, hypertension, and dilated pupils, but not nystagmus. Central nervous system infection would likely present with fever and other systemic signs. Serotonin syndrome usually involves hyperreflexia, clonus, and autonomic instability, which are not present here.",9
5272,"The patient has a fasting serum glucose concentration of 249 mg/dL, indicating type 2 diabetes mellitus. The most common first-line oral hypoglycemic agent for type 2 diabetes is metformin. Metformin primarily works by decreasing hepatic gluconeogenesis, which reduces the amount of glucose produced by the liver. This mechanism helps lower blood glucose levels without directly affecting insulin secretion or causing hypoglycemia. Other options like sulfonylureas increase insulin release, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors decrease carbohydrate hydrolysis, and GLP-1 agonists decrease glucagon release, but these are not the typical first-line treatments for a new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.",9
5279,"The patient has a history of myocardial infarction and is currently on a regimen that includes high-dose atorvastatin. Despite this, his LDL cholesterol remains elevated at 140 mg/dL, which is above the target for secondary prevention in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. The goal for LDL in such patients is typically less than 70 mg/dL. Ezetimibe is a cholesterol absorption inhibitor that can be added to statin therapy to further lower LDL cholesterol levels. The other options are not appropriate for addressing the elevated LDL: Furosemide is a diuretic used for fluid overload, Orlistat is a weight loss medication, and Losartan is an antihypertensive agent. Therefore, the most appropriate drug to add to his regimen to address the elevated LDL is Ezetimibe.",9
5274,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs consistent with hyperthyroidism, including weight loss, anxiety, insomnia, tachycardia, and a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland. The low TSH level supports this diagnosis. In pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, propylthiouracil (PTU) is preferred over methimazole due to the latter's teratogenic effects. PTU is safer for the developing fetus during early pregnancy. Atenolol, a beta-blocker, could be used to manage symptoms like tachycardia, but addressing the underlying hyperthyroidism is more critical at this stage. Lugol's iodine and thyroidectomy are not first-line treatments in this scenario.",9
5283,"The patient is experiencing symptoms consistent with thyroid storm, a severe form of hyperthyroidism. His laboratory results show elevated free T4 and suppressed TSH, indicating hyperthyroidism. Propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, is used in this context to manage symptoms such as tachycardia and agitation. Additionally, propranolol decreases the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, which helps reduce the levels of the more active thyroid hormone, T3, thereby alleviating symptoms of hyperthyroidism.",9
5269,"To determine the most likely finding that indicates a different diagnosis than asthma, we need to consider the characteristics of asthma and the implications of each option.

A. 129% of the predicted diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) - Asthma typically does not cause an increase in DLCO. An increased DLCO might suggest other conditions like pulmonary hemorrhage or polycythemia, but it does not rule out asthma.

B. Decrease in systolic blood pressure by 16 mm Hg during inspiration - This is known as pulsus paradoxus, which is commonly associated with asthma, especially during severe attacks, but can also be seen in other conditions like cardiac tamponade.

C. Decrease in FEV1 by 6% after administration of high-dose methacholine - Methacholine challenge is used to diagnose asthma. A decrease in FEV1 of less than 20% is generally considered a negative test for asthma, suggesting that asthma is unlikely.

D. Visibility of 11 posterior ribs in the midclavicular line above the diaphragm on chest x-ray - This suggests hyperinflation, which can be seen in asthma but is not exclusive to it.

The key finding that would most strongly indicate a different diagnosis than asthma is option C, as a methacholine challenge that does not significantly decrease FEV1 suggests the absence of bronchial hyperreactivity, which is a hallmark of asthma.",9
5280,"The patient's history and imaging findings are suggestive of mesothelioma, particularly given his occupational exposure as a demolition foreman, which likely involved asbestos exposure. The CT findings of pleural effusion, pleural thickening, and calcifications are characteristic of mesothelioma. Pathologically, mesothelioma is known for calretinin positivity and the presence of polygonal cells with long microvilli. This distinguishes it from other types of lung cancer, such as small cell lung cancer (option A), adenocarcinoma (option C), and squamous cell carcinoma (option D).",9
5302,"The patient is a 23-year-old pregnant woman at 12 weeks gestation presenting with symptoms suggestive of hyperthyroidism: increased sweating, palpitations, and tremor. Her thyroid panel shows suppressed TSH and elevated free T4, confirming hyperthyroidism. During pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, hyperthyroidism can be due to gestational transient thyrotoxicosis, often related to hyperemesis gravidarum, or Graves' disease. Given the recent vomiting episodes, gestational transient thyrotoxicosis is likely. 

In pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, methimazole is avoided due to teratogenic effects. Propylthiouracil (PTU) is preferred in the first trimester because it has a lower risk of causing birth defects. However, PTU is not indicated for transient thyrotoxicosis, which usually resolves on its own. 

The immediate management for symptomatic relief of hyperthyroid symptoms, such as palpitations and tremor, is a beta-blocker like propranolol. Ensuring proper hydration is also important, especially after episodes of vomiting.

Therefore, the best course of action is to ensure proper hydration and prescribe a beta-blocker for symptomatic relief.",9
5291,"The lesion described is likely a melanoma, given the irregular shape and pigmentation, along with the patient's family history of skin cancer. Melanocytes, the cells that give rise to melanoma, originate from neural crest cells during embryonic development. Neural crest cells are derived from the ectoderm but are a distinct population that migrates to various parts of the body, including the skin, where they differentiate into melanocytes. Therefore, the tissue type most directly giving rise to the lesion is neural crest cells.",9
5288,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a bowel obstruction, including colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, and absence of bowel movements. The high-pitched bowel sounds and tympanitic abdomen further support this. The history of upper abdominal pain radiating to the scapulae is consistent with gallbladder issues, such as gallstones. The presence of fever and leukocytosis suggests an inflammatory or infectious process. A cholecystoenteric fistula can occur when a large gallstone erodes into the intestine, leading to gallstone ileus, which is a type of bowel obstruction. This would explain the patient's symptoms and the x-ray findings likely showing air in the biliary tree or a gallstone causing obstruction. The other options are less consistent with the presentation: cecal torsion would not typically cause the upper abdominal pain history, bowel infarction would likely present with more severe pain and signs of peritonitis, and viscus perforation would cause free air under the diaphragm and signs of peritonitis.",9
5303,"The patient's symptoms and findings are suggestive of gastric cancer. The weight loss, epigastric pain, early satiety, anemia, and positive stool occult blood test indicate a possible malignancy. The endoscopic finding of a raised lesion with central ulceration on the lesser curvature of the stomach is characteristic of gastric adenocarcinoma. Histologically, gastric adenocarcinoma typically shows glandular structures formed by atypical cuboidal or columnar cells. Therefore, the biopsy is most likely to show gland-forming cuboidal cells, which is indicative of adenocarcinoma.",9
5306,"The patient has a thyroid nodule with ultrasound features suggestive of malignancy, such as irregular margins and microcalcifications. The fine-needle aspiration biopsy findings of Psammoma bodies and cells with clear, ground-glass, empty nuclei are characteristic of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Given the history of radiation exposure, the risk of thyroid cancer is increased. In this context, the most appropriate management for a confirmed papillary thyroid carcinoma is surgical removal of the thyroid gland, typically a total thyroidectomy, to prevent spread and allow for further treatment if necessary.",9
5311,"The patient's symptoms of dry, scaling skin that began at age 5 and have progressively worsened are characteristic of ichthyosis vulgaris. This condition often presents in childhood and is known for causing dry, scaly skin, particularly on the extensor surfaces. The fact that over-the-counter moisturizers have not resolved the issue also supports this diagnosis, as ichthyosis vulgaris often requires more specific treatments. Psoriasis typically presents with well-demarcated plaques and may have a different distribution. Miliaria is related to sweat gland obstruction and presents differently, often with small vesicles or papules. Seborrheic dermatitis usually affects areas with more sebaceous glands and presents with greasy scales, not just dry scales.",9
5308,"The patient has been exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as indicated by the presence of acid-fast bacilli in the sputum culture and right-sided hilar lymphadenopathy. The initial step in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis involves the inhalation of the bacteria, which are then phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages. However, the bacteria are able to survive and replicate within these macrophages due to their ability to inhibit phagosome-lysosome fusion. This replication within macrophages occurs before the adaptive immune response is activated, which includes the migration of T-helper cells to the lungs and the production of interferon-gamma. The formation of a nodular tubercle is a later event in the immune response to contain the infection.",9
5313,"The patient is presenting with signs of a postoperative infection, including joint pain, fever, erythema, and tenderness around the incision site. The wound cultures show Gram-positive cocci that are resistant to nafcillin. Nafcillin resistance in Gram-positive cocci is commonly associated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Streptococcus species, such as Streptococcus viridans and Streptococcus pyogenes, are not typically resistant to nafcillin. Escherichia coli is a Gram-negative rod and would not appear as Gram-positive cocci in cultures. Therefore, the most likely organism causing this infection is MRSA, which is a form of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to nafcillin.",9
5314,"The patient presents with severe abdominal pain and hematuria, which are classic symptoms of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones). The 24-hour urine collection shows hypercalciuria, suggesting calcium stones. The non-contrast CT likely confirmed the presence of kidney stones. The patient is prescribed a medication to prevent future stones. Thiazide diuretics are commonly used to reduce urinary calcium excretion and prevent calcium stone formation. Thiazides work by increasing calcium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron. Therefore, the medication prescribed to the patient most likely acts at the distal convoluted tubule.",9
5315,"The patient presents with hyponatremia (serum Na+ 120 mEq/L) and low serum osmolality (250 mOsm/kg), which indicates hypotonic hyponatremia. The urine osmolality is also low (195 mOsm/kg), and urine sodium is high (70 mEq/L), suggesting that the kidneys are excreting dilute urine despite the hyponatremia. This pattern is consistent with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), which is commonly associated with small cell lung carcinoma. The patient's history of small cell carcinoma of the lung makes this the most likely cause of SIADH and the resulting hyponatremia. Other options like bupropion and lithium can cause hyponatremia, but the association with small cell lung cancer is stronger in this context.",9
5317,"The patient has an incidental finding of a solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) on chest radiography. The nodule is 7 mm in diameter, which classifies it as a small nodule. The key considerations in evaluating an SPN include the size, shape, margins, and growth over time. Since the nodule was not present 5 years ago, it is new, which raises concern for potential malignancy. However, given its small size, invasive procedures like biopsy are not immediately indicated due to the risk of complications and the low yield of such procedures for small nodules. 

The best initial step for further evaluation of a small SPN is to obtain a thin-section CT scan. This will provide more detailed information about the nodule's characteristics, such as its density, precise margins, and any subtle calcifications that might suggest a benign etiology. A CT scan is non-invasive and can help determine the need for further follow-up or intervention. PET scans are generally more useful for larger nodules (usually >8-10 mm) due to their resolution limits. Biopsy procedures like TTNA or TBNA are more invasive and are not typically the first step for small nodules without suspicious features on CT.",9
5323,"The scenario describes a 13-year-old girl exhibiting behavioral changes, including withdrawal, anger, hostility, and truancy, along with allegations of inappropriate touching by a teacher. These behaviors and allegations could be indicative of potential sexual abuse, especially given the specific mention of inappropriate touching. While family issues such as divorce can contribute to behavioral changes, the allegation of inappropriate touching must be taken seriously and evaluated appropriately. The most immediate concern is to ensure the safety and well-being of the child and to investigate the allegations of abuse. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to refer the patient for confirmation of sexual abuse, as this will involve professionals trained to handle such sensitive situations and determine the validity of the allegations.",9
5326,"The patient presents with erectile dysfunction (ED) and has risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, and a history of smoking. These factors are associated with metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease, which can lead to ED. Given the patient's central obesity and elevated blood pressure, there is a suspicion of insulin resistance or diabetes mellitus, which are common causes of ED. Testing fasting serum glucose can help identify diabetes or prediabetes, which could be contributing to the patient's erectile dysfunction. Other options like plasma calcium, total serum bilirubin, and follicle-stimulating hormone are less directly related to the common causes of ED in this context.",9
5330,"Sensitivity is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the total number of actual positives (true positives + false negatives). In this case, the true positives are 47, and the false negatives are 9. Therefore, the sensitivity is 47 / (47 + 9) = 47 / 56 = 0.8393 or 83.93%. The current sensitivity is 77%. The improvement in sensitivity is 83.93% - 77% = 6.93%, which is almost 7%.",9
5321,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of infectious mononucleosis, including fever, sore throat, posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. These are classic for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. The Monospot test is a heterophile antibody test used to confirm the diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis. While a rapid strep test could be considered to rule out streptococcal pharyngitis, the presence of splenomegaly and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy makes mononucleosis more likely. Amoxicillin is not appropriate at this stage as it can cause a rash in patients with mononucleosis. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to confirm the diagnosis with a Monospot test.",9
5320,"The patient's symptoms include chronic diarrhea, flushing, and electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia. The diarrhea is watery and non-bloody, and there is a history of flushing episodes. These symptoms are suggestive of a neuroendocrine tumor, such as a VIPoma, which secretes vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). VIPomas cause watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria (WDHA syndrome), which aligns with the patient's decreased gastric acid production. The elevated calcium and glucose levels could also be related to a paraneoplastic syndrome or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), which can include VIPomas. The flushing episodes further support the diagnosis of a VIPoma rather than carcinoid syndrome, which typically causes diarrhea and flushing but is associated with increased serotonin production and usually involves the small intestine or bronchial system. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is elevated serum VIP concentration.",9
5329,"The clinical presentation of right flank pain radiating to the groin, along with nausea and mild hematuria, is suggestive of renal colic, likely due to a kidney stone. The normal plain X-ray suggests that the stone is radiolucent, as radiopaque stones like calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate would typically be visible. The absence of pus cells indicates no infection. The key to identifying the stone type lies in the urinalysis showing specific crystals. Uric acid stones are radiolucent and can present with these symptoms. Cysteine stones are also radiolucent but are less common and have a distinct hexagonal shape. Given the normal X-ray and typical presentation, uric acid stones are the most likely.",9
5338,"The patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), characterized by intrusive thoughts (obsessions) about harm coming to his family and compulsive behaviors (hand washing, praying, counting) to mitigate these thoughts. The most effective treatment for OCD is a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), specifically exposure and response prevention (ERP), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like fluoxetine. Benzodiazepines like clonazepam are not first-line treatments for OCD, and psychodynamic psychotherapy is not as effective for OCD as CBT. Aripiprazole is an antipsychotic and not typically used as a first-line treatment for OCD.",9
5333,"The patient's history and biopsy findings are key to determining the diagnosis. The patient is a long-term smoker, which increases the risk for various types of lung cancer. The chest x-ray shows a 2-cm solid nodule, and the biopsy reveals mucin-filled epithelial cells lining the alveolar basement membrane. These cells have prominent nucleoli, coarse chromatin, and some have multiple nuclei. 

Small cell carcinoma (A) typically presents with small, round, blue cells and is not characterized by mucin production. Pulmonary hamartoma (B) is a benign tumor that usually contains cartilage, fat, and connective tissue, not mucin-filled epithelial cells. Carcinoid tumor (D) is a neuroendocrine tumor that does not typically present with mucin-filled cells.

Adenocarcinoma in situ (C), formerly known as bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, is characterized by growth along the alveolar walls (lepidic growth) and can present with mucin production. The description of mucin-filled epithelial cells lining the alveolar basement membrane fits well with adenocarcinoma in situ.",9
5339,"The clinical presentation suggests an epidural hematoma, characterized by a lucid interval followed by unconsciousness, often due to middle meningeal artery rupture. The CT scan would likely show a biconvex (lens-shaped) hematoma. The patient's bradycardia, hypertension, and anisocoria indicate increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and possible brain herniation. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic used to reduce ICP by drawing fluid out of the brain tissue, making it the most appropriate immediate medical treatment in this scenario.",9
5342,"The patient presents with signs of hepatic encephalopathy, likely due to his history of cirrhosis and TIPS procedure. The disorientation, slurred speech, and daytime somnolence are indicative of this condition. The neurological exam findings, such as hyperreflexia and possibly asterixis (suggested by the video reference), support this diagnosis. The ascitic fluid analysis shows no signs of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (neutrophil count < 100 cells/mcL), ruling out infection as a cause of his symptoms. The standard treatment for hepatic encephalopathy is to reduce ammonia levels, primarily using lactulose, which works by trapping ammonia in the gut and promoting its excretion. Therefore, the next best step in management is to administer lactulose.",9
5340,"The symptoms and laboratory findings in this 5-month-old boy suggest a glycogen storage disease. The key features include weakness, dizziness, sweating, vertigo, hepatomegaly, increased lactate, uric acid, and elevated triglycerides. These are indicative of a problem with glucose metabolism, particularly in the liver.

The combination of hypoglycemia (suggested by dizziness and sweating), lactic acidosis (increased lactate), hyperuricemia (increased uric acid), and hyperlipidemia (elevated triglycerides) is characteristic of Von Gierke's disease (Glycogen Storage Disease Type I). This condition is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which is responsible for the final step in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, converting glucose-6-phosphate to glucose.

The other enzyme deficiencies listed do not match the full spectrum of symptoms:
- Debranching enzyme deficiency (Cori disease) would not typically cause lactic acidosis or hyperuricemia.
- Lysosomal α-1,4-glucosidase deficiency (Pompe disease) primarily affects muscle and heart, not causing the metabolic derangements seen here.
- Muscle glycogen phosphorylase deficiency (McArdle disease) affects muscle and would not cause hepatomegaly or the metabolic profile seen here.

Therefore, the enzyme deficiency that fits the clinical and laboratory findings is glucose-6-phosphatase.",9
5353,"The patient's presentation and colonoscopy findings are consistent with ulcerative colitis (UC). UC is characterized by continuous inflammation starting from the rectum and extending proximally, with histological findings such as crypt abscesses and pseudopolyps. A common extraintestinal manifestation associated with UC is primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a chronic liver disease that involves inflammation and scarring of the bile ducts. PSC is more commonly associated with UC than with Crohn's disease, and it is not associated with primary biliary cirrhosis, intestinal strictures, or aphthous ulcers, which are more related to Crohn's disease.",9
5347,"The patient's symptoms and MRI findings are suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS). She presents with optic neuritis, characterized by blurred vision, pain with eye movement, and an afferent pupillary defect (pupillary dilation when light is shone in the affected eye). The MRI findings of periventricular and juxtacortical hyperintensities further support the diagnosis of MS. The most appropriate next step in managing an acute exacerbation of MS, such as optic neuritis, is to administer high-dose corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and hasten recovery. Methylprednisolone is the standard treatment for acute MS exacerbations.",9
5363,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), including both upper and lower motor neuron signs. The upper motor neuron signs include increased muscle tone and hyperreflexia, while the lower motor neuron signs include muscle atrophy, fasciculations, and absent reflexes. The combination of dysarthria, muscle weakness, and the pattern of reflex changes further supports this diagnosis. Riluzole is the only medication approved for slowing the progression of ALS, making it the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient.",9
5373,"The mesonephric duct, also known as the Wolffian duct, is primarily involved in the development of male reproductive structures such as the epididymis, vas deferens, and seminal vesicles. In females, the mesonephric duct typically regresses and does not contribute to the development of the female reproductive tract. Instead, the paramesonephric ducts (Müllerian ducts) develop into the female reproductive structures such as the fallopian tubes, uterus, and the upper portion of the vagina. Therefore, the absence of structures arising from the mesonephric duct in a female fetus would not lead to malformations of the female reproductive tract. Thus, no malformation would be expected in this scenario.",9
5370,"At 36 weeks' gestation, it is standard practice to perform a Group B Streptococcus (GBS) culture. This is done to identify women who are carriers of GBS, as it can be transmitted to the newborn during delivery and cause serious infections. The other options are not typically indicated at this stage of pregnancy: a complete blood count is not routinely done at this point unless there are specific concerns, transabdominal doppler ultrasonography is not indicated without fetal concerns, and serum PAPP-A and HCG levels are used in first-trimester screening for chromosomal abnormalities, not at 36 weeks.",9
5365,"Prevalence is the total number of cases of a disease in a population at a given time, while incidence is the number of new cases that develop in a specific time period. If the incidence of PBC has remained stable, it means that the number of new cases per year has not changed. However, the prevalence has increased, indicating that more people are living with the disease. This can occur if the duration of the disease increases, which could be due to improved management and treatment, allowing patients to live longer with the disease. Therefore, the most plausible explanation for the increased prevalence, despite stable incidence, is improved quality of care for PBC, allowing patients to survive longer with the condition.",9
5377,"The patient's CT scan shows a well-circumscribed, calcified nodule, which is a common feature of a benign lesion. The histological examination reveals disorganized hyaline cartilage, myxoid regions, and clefts of ciliated epithelium. These findings are characteristic of a pulmonary hamartoma, which is a benign tumor composed of an abnormal mixture of tissues normally found in the lung, such as cartilage, connective tissue, and epithelium. The presence of cartilage and ciliated epithelium is particularly indicative of a hamartoma rather than other options like teratoma, carcinoma, or cyst.",9
5381,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest bladder cancer, likely urothelial carcinoma given the smoking history and presentation. The prognosis of bladder cancer is heavily influenced by the depth of invasion. 

- Option A: Dysplastic cells extending into the lamina propria indicate invasion beyond the urothelium into the connective tissue, which is associated with a worse prognosis compared to non-invasive lesions.
- Option B: Nests of atypical cells in the urothelium suggest carcinoma in situ or non-invasive papillary carcinoma, which generally have a better prognosis than invasive cancers.
- Option C: Friable urothelium with ulcerations could indicate a high-grade lesion but does not specify depth of invasion, making it less definitive for prognosis.
- Option D: Disordered urothelium lined with papillary fronds suggests a papillary carcinoma, which is often non-invasive and has a better prognosis unless invasion is specified.

The worst prognosis is associated with deeper invasion, so dysplastic cells extending into the lamina propria (Option A) indicates a worse prognosis due to invasion beyond the urothelium.",9
5382,"The patient is a young woman with occasional dizziness and palpitations, and an irregular pulse is noted on examination. The absence of murmurs and normal heart sounds suggest that structural heart disease is unlikely. The ECG likely shows an irregularly irregular rhythm, which is characteristic of atrial fibrillation or frequent premature atrial contractions. Given her age and the fact that she is asymptomatic most of the time, this is likely a benign condition such as premature atrial contractions or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. In a young, otherwise healthy individual with no significant symptoms or risk factors, reassurance is often the most appropriate management step. More invasive procedures or medications are not indicated unless the condition is causing significant symptoms or complications.",9
5376,"The clinical presentation of a 3-day-old infant with irritability, feeding intolerance, fever, and a bulging anterior fontanelle suggests meningitis. The Gram stain of the cerebrospinal fluid would provide crucial information about the causative organism. The key detail in the question is the expression of the K1 capsular polysaccharide. Escherichia coli, specifically the K1 strain, is known for causing neonatal meningitis and is characterized by the K1 capsular antigen. This capsular polysaccharide is a major virulence factor that helps the bacteria evade the host's immune system. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, and Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus) do not have the K1 capsular polysaccharide. Therefore, the most likely causal pathogen in this case is Escherichia coli.",9
5386,"The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings suggest aortic stenosis. The key findings include a systolic ejection murmur best heard at the right 2nd intercostal space and delayed, diminished carotid pulses (pulsus parvus et tardus). Aortic stenosis can lead to a condition known as Heyde's syndrome, which is the association of aortic stenosis with gastrointestinal bleeding due to colonic angiodysplasia. This occurs because the turbulent blood flow through the stenotic aortic valve can lead to acquired von Willebrand factor deficiency, increasing the risk of bleeding from angiodysplasias. Therefore, the most likely association with this patient's condition is colonic angiodysplasia.",9
5345,"The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is experiencing exacerbation symptoms, possibly due to a bacterial infection given her productive cough with yellow sputum. In patients with COPD, especially those who smoke, vaccination against pneumococcal disease is critical to prevent bacterial infections. The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) is recommended to reduce the risk of pneumococcal infections in adults with chronic lung disease. This vaccine works by inducing a T-cell independent B-cell response with moderate level affinity antibodies. Therefore, option C is correct.",9
5367,"The patient is presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), including high blood glucose, fruity breath odor (indicative of ketones), and signs of dehydration and shock (hypotension, tachypnea, delayed capillary refill). The initial management of DKA involves fluid resuscitation to address dehydration and hypotension, which has already been started. The next critical step is to address the hyperglycemia and ketosis. This is best achieved with intravenous regular insulin, which allows for rapid control of blood glucose levels and resolution of ketoacidosis. Subcutaneous insulin (glargine or lispro) is not appropriate in this acute setting due to slower onset and absorption. Intravenous glucagon is not indicated as the patient is hyperglycemic, not hypoglycemic.",9
5399,"The patient presents with shortness of breath, a dry cough, and a significant smoking history. The spirometry results show an FEV1:FVC ratio of 65%, indicating an obstructive pattern (normal is >70%). The FEV1 is 70% of predicted, suggesting mild obstruction. The DLCO is significantly reduced at 42% of predicted, which is a key finding. 

In obstructive lung diseases, a reduced DLCO is characteristic of emphysema due to the destruction of alveolar walls, leading to impaired gas exchange. Pulmonary fibrosis typically presents with a restrictive pattern and a reduced DLCO, but the spirometry here shows obstruction. Asthma usually has a normal or increased DLCO. Bronchiectasis can have a normal or slightly reduced DLCO, but not as low as seen here.

Given the obstructive pattern and the significantly reduced DLCO, emphysema is the most likely diagnosis.",9
5384,"The patient presents with hirsutism, which is excessive hair growth in a male pattern. Her menstrual cycles are regular, and she is on oral contraceptives. Her BMI indicates obesity, which can be associated with insulin resistance. The lab results show elevated LH and FSH, which is unusual as typically in PCOS, LH is elevated but FSH is normal or low. However, the key finding here is the elevated dihydrotestosterone (DHT) level, which suggests increased conversion of testosterone to DHT. This is mediated by the enzyme 5-alpha reductase. The normal testosterone level and elevated DHT point towards increased activity of 5-alpha reductase as the cause of her hirsutism.",9
5385,"The patient's symptoms, including gradual enlargement of fingertips, hoarse voice, weight loss, and wheezing, suggest hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, which can be associated with lung cancer. Given the hoarseness, weight loss, and wheezing, the most likely underlying condition is a lung tumor, particularly in the right upper lung field where wheezing is noted. This is consistent with a Pancoast tumor, which can cause Horner's syndrome, characterized by miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis due to sympathetic chain involvement.",9
5403,"The patient likely has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, which is common in African American males and can lead to hemolytic anemia after exposure to oxidative stress (such as aspirin). The peripheral blood smear shows Heinz bodies, which are inclusions of denatured hemoglobin. G6PD is part of the pentose phosphate pathway, which is crucial for producing NADPH. NADPH is necessary for maintaining reduced glutathione in red blood cells, protecting them from oxidative damage. The pentose phosphate pathway also produces ribose-5-phosphate, a precursor for nucleotide synthesis. Transaldolase is an enzyme in the non-oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway, which is involved in the interconversion of sugars and is essential for the production of ribose-5-phosphate, and thus nucleotides.",9
5406,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest biliary colic, likely due to gallstones. The abdominal X-ray likely shows calcified gallstones. Gallstones are a risk factor for gallbladder carcinoma, especially if they are large or if there is chronic inflammation of the gallbladder. The other options are less likely given the presentation and typical associations: hepatocellular carcinoma is more associated with liver disease, hydatid cysts are related to echinococcal infection, and aortic aneurysm rupture is unrelated to gallstones.",9
5405,"The laboratory findings show that the student is negative for HBsAg, HBeAg, Anti-HBs, Anti-HBc IgG, Anti-HBc IgM, Anti-HBe, and Anti-HCV. This indicates that she has no current or past infection with hepatitis B or C. The presence of Anti-HAV IgG and absence of Anti-HAV IgM suggest past infection or vaccination against hepatitis A, but no current infection. Since Anti-HBs is negative, she has not been vaccinated against hepatitis B, as vaccination would result in positive Anti-HBs. Therefore, the correct statement is that she has not been vaccinated against the hepatitis B virus.",9
5407,"The patient's presentation includes syncope, hypertension, and a firm, nodular prostate on examination. The syncope episode could be related to his hypertension or another cardiovascular issue, but the question focuses on the prostate exam findings. A firm and nodular prostate is concerning for prostate cancer, especially in the context of a 51-year-old man. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) typically presents with a smooth, enlarged prostate rather than a firm and nodular one. Prostatitis would likely present with a tender prostate and possibly systemic symptoms like fever, which are not present here. A normal physical exam would not include a firm, nodular prostate. Therefore, the most concerning finding in this context is prostate cancer.",9
5410,"The clinical presentation and genetic testing suggest that the twin sister has cystic fibrosis, which is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. The deletion of an amino acid in a membrane channel is characteristic of the common ΔF508 mutation in cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that an affected individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent.

Since the twin sister is affected, she must have received one mutated allele from each parent. This means both parents are carriers of the disease allele. For the twin brother, there are three possibilities:
1. He is affected (homozygous recessive) - 25% chance.
2. He is a carrier (heterozygous) - 50% chance.
3. He is unaffected and not a carrier (homozygous dominant) - 25% chance.

Since the question asks for the probability that the twin brother is a carrier, we focus on the second possibility. The probability that he is a carrier is 50%.",9
5416,"The patient is a high school wrestler who has lost weight rapidly, which can lead to nutritional deficiencies. He presents with dry, cracking skin, irritability, fatigue, and decreased sensation in the extremities. His lab results show elevated homocysteine levels, which can be associated with vitamin B6, B12, or folate deficiencies. These deficiencies can cause neurological symptoms and skin changes. The symptoms and lab findings are consistent with a water-soluble vitamin deficiency, particularly vitamin B6 or B12, which can cause peripheral neuropathy and mood changes. Anabolic steroid use could cause mood changes and acne but is less likely to cause the specific neurological symptoms and elevated homocysteine. A dermatologic fungal infection would not explain the neurological symptoms or elevated homocysteine. A viral infection is less likely given the specific lab findings and symptoms. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a water-soluble vitamin deficiency.",9
5419,"The patient is presenting with symptoms suggestive of bipolar disorder. She has periods of depression and a history of a manic episode characterized by hyperactivity, decreased need for sleep, and excessive energy. In bipolar disorder, mood stabilizers are typically used to manage the condition. Lithium is a well-established mood stabilizer that is effective in treating both manic and depressive episodes in bipolar disorder. Chlorpromazine is an antipsychotic, ramelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist used for insomnia, and amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant, which is not appropriate as it can potentially trigger manic episodes in bipolar disorder. Therefore, the best course of treatment for this patient is lithium.",9
5423,"The patient is experiencing a severe flare of ulcerative colitis, characterized by numerous bloody stools, fever, and abdominal distension. The CT scan shows a markedly dilated colon, suggesting toxic megacolon, a serious complication of ulcerative colitis. In such cases, the immediate management involves bowel rest, intravenous fluids, and high-dose intravenous corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and prevent further complications. Oral prednisone is not appropriate due to the severity of the condition and potential for impaired absorption. IV hydrocortisone is the correct choice as it provides systemic anti-inflammatory effects quickly. Metoclopramide and ondansetron are not relevant to the management of toxic megacolon.",9
5425,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), including joint pain, subcutaneous nodules, and characteristic hand deformities (swan neck deformity). The laboratory findings show pancytopenia, which could be related to Felty's syndrome (RA, splenomegaly, and neutropenia). The most specific test for RA is the anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody, which is more specific than rheumatoid factor (RF) for diagnosing RA.",9
5387,"The patient's symptoms and physical findings suggest a thyroid issue. Hoarseness and dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) with a hard neck mass, along with systemic symptoms like dry skin and leg swelling, point towards a thyroid-related condition. The neck swelling that does not move on swallowing and decreased peripheral pulses suggest a fibrous or infiltrative disease affecting the thyroid gland.

The biopsy of such a thyroid mass is most consistent with Riedel's thyroiditis, a rare form of chronic thyroiditis. In Riedel's thyroiditis, there is extensive fibrosis of the thyroid, often associated with a background of autoimmune thyroiditis. The fibrosis can extend to surrounding tissues, causing compression of local structures (such as the airways and esophagus), leading to hoarseness and difficulty swallowing.

On histopathology, Riedel's thyroiditis would show collagen deposition and destruction of thyroid follicles with a marked decrease in the number of thyroid follicles. This aligns with the findings outlined in option B.",9
5429,"The patient presents with weakness in the right hand, specifically decreased sensation over the 4th and 5th digits and difficulty extending these digits. This suggests involvement of the ulnar nerve, which innervates the intrinsic muscles of the hand responsible for finger extension at the interphalangeal joints, particularly affecting the 4th and 5th digits. The radial nerve primarily affects wrist and finger extension but would not typically cause isolated sensory loss in the 4th and 5th digits. The median nerve affects the thumb, index, and middle fingers, while the axillary nerve affects the shoulder area. Therefore, the symptoms align most closely with ulnar nerve damage.",9

5433,"The patient's symptoms and lab findings suggest a urea cycle disorder, specifically ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency. This is supported by the increased ammonia and orotic acid levels, along with decreased BUN. OTC deficiency is an X-linked disorder that results in the accumulation of carbamoyl phosphate, which is then converted to orotic acid. The treatment with sodium benzoate and phenylbutyrate helps to remove excess nitrogen. Gene therapy targeting the enzyme that produces citrulline, which is the product of the OTC enzyme reaction, would correct this condition.",9
5431,"The patient is experiencing stress urinary incontinence, which is characterized by involuntary leakage of urine during activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure, such as coughing or exercising. This condition is often due to weakened pelvic floor muscles or urethral hypermobility, commonly following childbirth or pelvic surgery. The patient's history of a complicated delivery with a grade 3 episiotomy suggests potential pelvic floor damage, contributing to her symptoms. 

Behavioral changes and Kegel exercises have not been effective, indicating that a more definitive treatment is needed. The most effective surgical treatment for stress urinary incontinence is a mid-urethral sling procedure. This procedure works by providing support to the urethra, thereby preventing involuntary leakage during activities that increase abdominal pressure. The mechanism of action is the anatomic elevation of the urethra, which helps restore the normal continence mechanism.

Other options listed do not address the underlying issue of stress urinary incontinence: 
- Oral estrogen therapy (A) is not effective for stress incontinence and is more relevant for postmenopausal women with atrophic vaginitis.
- Inhibition of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase (B) is related to antibiotic action, irrelevant here.
- Dilation of a urethral or ureteral stricture (C) is not applicable as there is no indication of a stricture.

Therefore, the best course of treatment involves anatomic elevation of the urethra.",9
5445,"This patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with a urinary tract infection (UTI), likely pyelonephritis, given the flank pain and systemic symptoms. During pregnancy, hormonal changes, particularly increased progesterone, lead to decreased ureteral smooth muscle tone. This results in ureteral dilation and decreased peristalsis, which can cause urinary stasis. Urinary stasis increases the risk of bacterial growth and ascending infections, contributing to UTIs. The positive leukocyte esterase and nitrites on the urine dipstick support the diagnosis of a bacterial UTI. Other options, such as increased body temperature, decreased urine volume, or increased urinary pH, are not directly related to the physiological changes in pregnancy that predispose to UTIs.",9
5451,"The patient is presenting with acute onset of right-sided weakness and facial droop, which are classic signs of a stroke. In the emergency setting, it is crucial to differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke to determine the appropriate treatment. The best initial imaging study to evaluate for a stroke is a noncontrast CT of the brain. This will help identify if there is any intracranial hemorrhage, which would contraindicate the use of thrombolytics if the stroke is ischemic. Therefore, obtaining a noncontrast CT of the brain is the best next step in management.",9
5472,"Patients undergoing splenectomy are at increased risk for infections with encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae. To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to vaccinate against these organisms at least 2 weeks prior to the surgery to allow adequate immune response. Additionally, penicillin prophylaxis is typically started at the time of surgery and continued for at least 5 years, or sometimes indefinitely, depending on the patient's risk factors and physician's discretion.",9
5466,"The patient presents with fever, night sweats, and a holosystolic murmur that increases with inspiration, which is suggestive of tricuspid valve endocarditis. This is common in intravenous drug users due to the introduction of bacteria into the bloodstream. The most common organism involved is Staphylococcus aureus. The sequelae of right-sided endocarditis, particularly tricuspid valve involvement, often include septic pulmonary emboli due to embolization of infected material from the tricuspid valve to the lungs. This can lead to pulmonary embolism, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms and history.",9
5473,"The patient's symptoms are suggestive of giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis), which is characterized by headache, jaw claudication, and tenderness over the temporal artery. The associated difficulty in getting up from a chair and raising arms suggests polymyalgia rheumatica, which often coexists with giant cell arteritis. The main complication of untreated giant cell arteritis is vision loss due to ischemic optic neuropathy. To prevent this complication, high-dose corticosteroids are the treatment of choice.",9
5483,"The patient has a bleeding ulcer in the proximal duodenum, which suggests a potential source of gastrointestinal bleeding. However, the stool guaiac test is negative for occult blood, which is unusual given the presence of a bleeding ulcer. The key lab finding is the serum iron level of 130 μg/dL, which is within the normal range, but the negative stool guaiac test despite a bleeding ulcer is unusual. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is known to interfere with the guaiac-based fecal occult blood test, leading to false-negative results. Therefore, over-ingestion of ascorbic acid is the most likely cause for the negative stool guaiac test in the presence of a bleeding ulcer.",9
5479,"The patient is a 40-year-old man with AIDS and a very low CD4 count of 44/mm3, indicating severe immunosuppression. He presents with symptoms including fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nonproductive cough, weight loss, and violaceous skin lesions, which are likely Kaposi's sarcoma. The blood culture grows acid-fast organisms, which in the context of AIDS and a low CD4 count, is highly suggestive of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection. MAC is common in AIDS patients with CD4 counts below 50/mm3. The PPD skin test is negative, which makes active tuberculosis less likely. The appropriate treatment for disseminated MAC infection is a combination of azithromycin and ethambutol.",9
5485,"The patient's symptoms and CSF findings are suggestive of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). The key features include progressive lower extremity weakness, absent reflexes, and elevated protein in the CSF with a normal white cell count (albuminocytologic dissociation). The history of recent diarrhea after drinking unfiltered water suggests a possible Campylobacter jejuni infection, which is a known trigger for GBS. The appropriate management for GBS includes supportive care and specific treatments such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or plasmapheresis. Therefore, plasmapheresis is part of the management for the most likely diagnosis of GBS.",9
5488,"The clinical presentation is highly suggestive of acute epiglottitis, especially given the child's age, the rapid onset of symptoms, the presence of stridor, drooling, and the tripod position. The fact that the child is an immigrant with uncertain vaccination status raises the suspicion for Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) as a potential cause, although other bacteria can also cause epiglottitis. The priority in managing suspected epiglottitis is to secure the airway due to the risk of sudden airway obstruction. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to perform nasotracheal intubation in a controlled setting, such as the operating room, with an experienced anesthesiologist or otolaryngologist present. This ensures the airway is secured before any further diagnostic or therapeutic interventions are undertaken.",9
5501,"The patient's symptoms and travel history are key to diagnosing his condition. He presents with fever, non-bloody diarrhea, headache, anorexia, abdominal pain, and a blanchable rash after returning from India. His vital signs show a high fever with relative bradycardia (high fever with a normal or low pulse rate), which is characteristic of enteric fever (typhoid fever). The rash described as blanchable on the chest and trunk is consistent with 'rose spots,' which are associated with enteric fever. Additionally, the laboratory findings show leukopenia (low white blood cell count) and neutropenia, which are also common in enteric fever. Leptospirosis, malaria, and nontyphoidal salmonellosis have different clinical presentations and laboratory findings. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is enteric fever.",9
5506,"The tuberculin skin test (PPD) is used to determine if someone has been exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The reaction is a type IV hypersensitivity reaction, which is mediated by T cells, specifically Th1 cells. When the PPD is injected into the skin, it is processed by antigen-presenting cells, which then present the antigen to Th1 cells. These Th1 cells release cytokines such as IFN-gamma, which recruit macrophages and other immune cells to the site, causing induration and swelling. This is a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, not involving antibodies or complement, and is not related to IgE or opsonization.",9
5499,"The patient's symptoms are suggestive of peptic ulcer disease, particularly given the timing of the pain (several hours after a meal) and relief with antacids. The absence of alarming symptoms like bleeding, anemia, or weight loss makes a non-invasive approach reasonable. Helicobacter pylori infection is a common cause of peptic ulcers, and testing for H. pylori is a logical next step. The urease breath test is a non-invasive, accurate method to detect H. pylori infection. Upper endoscopy is more invasive and typically reserved for cases with alarming symptoms or if initial treatment fails. Esophageal pH monitoring is used for diagnosing GERD, which is less likely given the symptom pattern. A barium swallow is not typically used for initial evaluation of peptic ulcer disease.",9
5514,"The patient has cirrhosis with ascites and presents with signs of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), as indicated by the elevated white blood cell count with a high percentage of neutrophils in the ascitic fluid. The diagnostic criterion for SBP is an ascitic fluid absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 250 cells/uL or more. The presence of 85% neutrophils in a WBC count of 1196/uL confirms this diagnosis. The standard treatment for SBP is a third-generation cephalosporin, such as cefotaxime, which covers the common organisms responsible for SBP, including E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Increasing diuretics or performing a TIPS procedure is not appropriate for acute SBP, and metronidazole is not the correct antibiotic choice for this condition.",9
5517,"The patient presents with signs of septic shock, likely due to toxic shock syndrome (TSS) from nasal packing. Her hypotension, tachycardia, and purpuric rash are indicative of this condition. The nasal packing is a potential source of infection, particularly with Staphylococcus aureus, which can produce toxins leading to TSS. The immediate step in management for suspected TSS is to remove the source of infection, which in this case is the nasal packing. While antibiotics and vasopressors are important, the removal of the source is critical to control the infection and toxin production.",9
5524,"The patient has metastatic prostate cancer with a new sclerotic lesion at the L5 vertebral body, causing significant pain. The pain is not relieved by NSAIDs or acetaminophen, indicating the need for more targeted treatment. Local radiation therapy is effective for palliation of pain from bone metastases, especially in prostate cancer, which often causes sclerotic bone lesions. Flutamide is an anti-androgen used in combination with other therapies for prostate cancer, but the patient has already undergone bilateral orchiectomy, which significantly reduces androgen levels. Spinal surgery is not indicated unless there is spinal cord compression or instability, which is not mentioned here. Prostatectomy is not appropriate for metastatic disease. Therefore, local radiation is the most appropriate next step to manage the patient's pain.",9
5519,"The Valsalva maneuver consists of four phases. During phase I, there is an initial increase in intrathoracic pressure, which transiently increases blood pressure due to compression of the aorta, not a decrease. In early phase II, the continued high intrathoracic pressure reduces venous return, leading to a decrease in cardiac output and blood pressure, which triggers a reflex increase in heart rate. In late phase II, compensatory mechanisms (like peripheral vasoconstriction) lead to a recovery of blood pressure, often accompanied by a further increase in heart rate. Phase III involves a transient drop in blood pressure as the maneuver is released, and phase IV is characterized by a rebound increase in blood pressure and a reflex bradycardia. The Valsalva ratio is actually defined as the ratio of the maximum heart rate during phase II to the minimum heart rate during phase IV, not the other way around. Therefore, the correct statement is about late phase II.",9
5533,"The patient is a 47-year-old man with a family history of malignant melanoma, but his brother's condition does not significantly increase his risk compared to other more common causes of death. He is a forklift operator, which might suggest some risk of industrial accidents, but these are generally less common causes of death compared to diseases. Occasional smoking and moderate alcohol consumption do not significantly elevate his risk for coronary artery disease, but coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death in middle-aged men. Prostate cancer is a concern as men age, but it is less likely to be the leading cause of death in the next 15 years compared to coronary artery disease. Therefore, considering his age and general health profile, coronary artery disease is the most likely cause of death over the next 15 years.",9
5508,"The patient's symptoms and history are suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS), particularly the sudden onset of lower limb weakness, urinary retention, and Lhermitte's sign (electric shock-like sensations on neck flexion). The past episode of left arm weakness that resolved spontaneously also supports this diagnosis. The presence of bilateral optic disc swelling suggests optic neuritis, which is common in MS. The acute presentation of neurological deficits in MS is typically managed with high-dose corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and hasten recovery. Therefore, the next best step in management is intravenous methylprednisolone.",9
5538,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest chronic kidney disease (CKD) with secondary hyperparathyroidism. The bone pain, fractures, and radiographic findings of cystic lesions and subperiosteal thinning are indicative of osteitis fibrosa cystica, a condition associated with hyperparathyroidism. In CKD, there is decreased renal excretion of phosphate and reduced production of active vitamin D, leading to hypocalcemia. This stimulates parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, causing increased bone resorption and fibrous tissue replacement in bone, known as osteitis fibrosa cystica. Therefore, the underlying cause of the radiographic findings is hormone-mediated fibrous replacement of bone due to secondary hyperparathyroidism.",9
5542,"The patient is exhibiting signs of acute confusion and agitation, which are characteristic of delirium. Delirium is common in elderly patients post-surgery, especially those with a history of alcohol use. The patient's symptoms include fluctuating levels of consciousness, agitation, and disorientation, which align with delirium rather than a primary psychiatric disorder or focal neurological issue. In managing delirium, especially when the patient is a danger to themselves or others, the use of antipsychotics like haloperidol is appropriate. Benzodiazepines like lorazepam are generally avoided in delirium unless alcohol withdrawal is suspected, which is not strongly indicated here given the patient's history and current alcohol use. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to administer haloperidol to manage the acute agitation and confusion.",9
5543,"The patient presents with signs of shock, likely due to hemorrhagic causes given the context of multiple stab wounds. Initially, he is hypotensive and tachycardic, which suggests hypovolemic shock. Despite receiving whole blood, his condition worsens, with further drops in blood pressure and increased heart rate, leading to cardiac arrest. The presence of bilateral wheezing and shortness of breath during the secondary survey suggests a possible anaphylactic reaction, which could be related to IgA deficiency. Patients with IgA deficiency can have anaphylactic reactions to blood products containing IgA. This would explain the acute decompensation and respiratory symptoms observed. Therefore, the most likely cause of decompensation is an anaphylactic reaction due to IgA deficiency.",9
5525,"The patient presents with fatigue, leg swelling, and laboratory findings suggestive of kidney dysfunction, including elevated creatinine and proteinuria. The renal biopsy shows sclerosis in the capillary tufts and arterial hyalinosis. These findings are consistent with hypertensive nephrosclerosis. Arterial hypertension can lead to damage of the renal vasculature, resulting in sclerosis and hyalinosis. While diabetes mellitus can also cause kidney damage, the biopsy findings are more indicative of hypertensive changes rather than diabetic nephropathy, which typically shows nodular glomerulosclerosis (Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions). Amyloidosis would show amyloid deposits, and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis would show mesangial proliferation and immune complex deposits. Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism is arterial hypertension.",9
5548,"The patient presents with shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, and clubbing of the fingers. The pulmonary function tests show a reduced FVC (78% of expected) and a normal or increased FEV1/FVC ratio (92%), which is indicative of a restrictive lung disease rather than an obstructive one. Fine inspiratory crackles and clubbing are also suggestive of interstitial lung disease. The CT scan, although not visible here, would likely show reticular patterns or honeycombing if pulmonary fibrosis were present. The smoking history is relevant but not definitive for COPD, especially given the restrictive pattern on PFTs. Bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and chronic bronchiectasis typically present with obstructive patterns on PFTs. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis given the restrictive pattern, crackles, and clubbing is pulmonary fibrosis.",9
5553,"The patient has fasting glucose levels indicative of type 2 diabetes mellitus, as her levels are above the threshold of 126 mg/dl. The first-line oral pharmacologic agent for type 2 diabetes is metformin. Metformin works primarily by decreasing hepatic glucose production, specifically by inhibiting gluconeogenesis in the liver. This helps lower blood glucose levels. The other options describe mechanisms of other diabetes medications: A) Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activating receptors is the mechanism of thiazolidinediones, B) Closure of potassium channels in pancreatic beta cells is the mechanism of sulfonylureas, and C) Inhibition of alpha-glucosidase in the intestinal brush border is the mechanism of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors.",9
5570,"The patient presents with symptoms and examination findings suggestive of lichen sclerosus, characterized by vulvar itching, dryness, and a well-demarcated white plaque. The biopsy has ruled out cancer, which is important in confirming the diagnosis of lichen sclerosus. The standard treatment for lichen sclerosus is high-potency topical corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and symptoms. Topical clobetasol is a high-potency corticosteroid and is the appropriate treatment for lichen sclerosus. Topical estrogen is more appropriate for atrophic vaginitis, which is not the primary issue here. Topical progesterone and phototherapy are not standard treatments for lichen sclerosus.",9
5587,"To determine which biopsy finding is associated with the lowest potential for malignant transformation, we need to understand the histological features of different types of polyps. 

- **A. Tree-like branching of muscularis mucosa**: This description is not typical for any specific type of polyp commonly associated with low malignant potential.

- **B. Regenerating epithelium with inflammatory infiltrate**: This suggests an inflammatory polyp, which is generally benign and not associated with malignant transformation.

- **C. Finger-like projections with a fibrovascular core**: This describes a villous adenoma, which has a higher risk of malignant transformation.

- **D. Hyperplastic epithelium at the base of crypts**: This describes a hyperplastic polyp, which is considered benign with a very low risk of malignant transformation.

Among these options, hyperplastic polyps (option D) are known to have the lowest potential for malignant transformation.",9
5590,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of aspiration pneumonia, indicated by the productive cough with foul-smelling sputum, respiratory distress, and infiltrates in the right posterior upper lobe on chest x-ray. The arterial blood gas analysis shows respiratory alkalosis with hypoxemia. The strongest predisposing factor for aspiration pneumonia in this patient is likely related to her neurological status. She has a history of ischemic stroke, which can lead to dysphagia and impaired gag reflex, increasing the risk of aspiration. While past alcohol abuse can also predispose to aspiration due to potential neurological impairment, the recent stroke is a more direct and significant factor in this context. Living in an assisted-living community and gastritis are less directly related to aspiration risk compared to the neurological deficits from the stroke.",9
5601,"The patient is unresponsive with no carotid pulse, indicating cardiac arrest. The ECG is not provided, but the absence of a pulse and the sudden collapse suggest a possible ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT), both of which are shockable rhythms. In the context of cardiac arrest, the immediate management for VF or pulseless VT is defibrillation. Intravenous magnesium sulfate is used for torsades de pointes, a specific type of VT, but defibrillation is prioritized in cardiac arrest. Cardiac catheterization is not an immediate intervention in this scenario, and intravenous amiodarone is used after defibrillation attempts if the rhythm persists. Therefore, the most appropriate immediate step is defibrillation.",9
5592,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with amaurosis fugax, which is a transient monocular vision loss often described as a ""curtain coming down"" over the eye. This condition is typically caused by a temporary reduction in blood flow to the retina, often due to emboli originating from atherosclerotic plaques. The presence of a high-pitched sound, or bruit, over the left neck suggests turbulent blood flow, likely due to carotid artery stenosis. Given her history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, she is at risk for atherosclerosis, which can lead to carotid artery disease. The emboli from the carotid artery can travel to the ophthalmic artery, causing the transient vision loss. Therefore, the etiology of her symptoms most likely localizes to the carotid artery.",9
5613,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a paraneoplastic syndrome, specifically SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion), given the hyponatremia (Na 121 mEq/L) and confusion. His history of smoking and occupational exposure as a shipyard mechanic raises suspicion for lung cancer. The most common lung cancer associated with SIADH is small cell lung cancer (SCLC). On histological examination, SCLC is characterized by undifferentiated small round blue cells. Therefore, the biopsy of the responsible lesions in this patient is most likely to demonstrate undifferentiated small round blue cells, consistent with small cell lung cancer.",9
5622,"The patient presents with macrocytic anemia (MCV 112 fL) and a history of Crohn's disease, which can lead to malabsorption issues. The normal ferritin and iron levels suggest that iron deficiency is not the cause of the anemia. The elevated MCV indicates a possible vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. Crohn's disease can affect the terminal ileum, where vitamin B12 is absorbed, leading to B12 deficiency. B12 deficiency can cause neurological symptoms, including decreased vibratory sensation, due to subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Therefore, further evaluation is likely to reveal decreased vibratory sensation.",9
5623,"In a randomized clinical trial, it's important to ensure that the groups being compared are similar in terms of baseline characteristics. This helps to ensure that any differences in outcomes can be attributed to the intervention rather than pre-existing differences between the groups. The table comparing socioeconomic demographics, medical conditions, and family history of breast cancer is likely included to demonstrate that the randomization process was successful in creating comparable groups. This helps to minimize confounding, where differences in baseline characteristics could influence the outcomes. Therefore, the purpose of the table is to evaluate the effectiveness of randomization in achieving comparable groups.",9
5635,"The patient presents with a neck mass and has a history of HIV. The biopsy shows atypical mononuclear cells, eosinophils, plasma cells, histiocytes, atypical T-lymphocytes, and bilobed cells, which are characteristic of Reed-Sternberg cells. These findings are consistent with Hodgkin lymphoma. In HIV-positive patients, mixed cellularity classical Hodgkin lymphoma is more common. The presence of a mixed inflammatory background with eosinophils and plasma cells also supports this subtype. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is mixed cellularity classical Hodgkin lymphoma.",9
5637,"The clinical presentation of the 3-year-old boy suggests Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), which is characterized by features such as macroglossia (large tongue), omphalocele or umbilical hernia, macrosomia (excessive growth), and hypoglycemia. Additionally, hepatomegaly is often present. BWS is associated with genetic alterations on chromosome 11, specifically involving the 11p15 region. This region contains genes that are important for growth regulation, and alterations can lead to overgrowth syndromes. The most common genetic mechanism in BWS is the alteration of the imprinting center on the short arm of chromosome 11, leading to dysregulation of genes such as IGF2 and H19. Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism is a mutation in a tumor suppressor gene on the short arm of chromosome 11.",9
5636,"The patient is a 42-year-old man with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, as evidenced by his high fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels. Initially, he was started on metformin and lifestyle modifications, but his follow-up results show worsening hyperglycemia with a serum blood glucose of 370 mg/dL and an HbA1c of 11%. He also reports symptoms of weight loss and excessive urination, which are indicative of significant hyperglycemia.

Given the severity of his hyperglycemia and the symptoms, the patient requires a more aggressive treatment approach. Basal-bolus insulin therapy is the most effective way to rapidly control severe hyperglycemia and manage symptoms. This regimen involves using a long-acting insulin to provide a baseline level of insulin and rapid-acting insulin to manage postprandial glucose spikes.

Options B, C, and D involve adding medications to metformin, but they are unlikely to provide the rapid and significant glucose control needed in this situation. Basal insulin alone (option B) might not be sufficient to control postprandial glucose levels. SGLT2 inhibitors (option C) and thiazolidinediones (option D) are not appropriate for immediate control of severe hyperglycemia.

Therefore, the optimal therapy for this patient is basal-bolus insulin.",9
5640,"The patient's symptoms include sharp, stabbing pain in the lower back radiating to the left leg, loss of sensitivity around the buttocks and inner thighs, and urinary difficulties. These symptoms suggest involvement of the lower spinal nerves. The reduced strength and reflexes in the left lower extremity, along with the reduced squeeze tone of the anal sphincter, indicate possible nerve root compression. The normal resting anal sphincter tone but reduced squeeze tone suggests partial involvement of the sacral nerves. Given the history of prostate cancer and radiation therapy, metastatic disease or radiation-induced damage could be affecting the lower spinal nerves. The combination of unilateral leg symptoms, saddle anesthesia, and urinary issues is characteristic of cauda equina syndrome, which involves compression of the nerve roots below the conus medullaris.",9
5645,"The patient presents with worsening abdominal pain, constipation, blood in stool, and jaundice. He has a significant smoking history and a palpable liver edge. The lab results show anemia and elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), suggesting liver involvement. The right upper quadrant tenderness and jaundice could suggest liver or biliary pathology. However, the blood coating the stool and constipation are more indicative of a lower gastrointestinal issue. Colon cancer can cause obstruction leading to constipation, and it can metastasize to the liver, causing hepatomegaly and elevated liver enzymes. The smoking history and age also increase the risk for colon cancer. The presentation aligns with colon cancer with possible liver metastasis, explaining the abdominal findings and lab results.",9
5646,"The patient's presentation includes fatigue, pallor, petechiae, splenomegaly, anemia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. The blood smear shows immature cells with large, prominent nucleoli and pink, elongated, needle-shaped cytoplasmic inclusions, which are Auer rods. Auer rods are indicative of myeloblasts, which are characteristic of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The high leukocyte count and the presence of immature cells further support this diagnosis. The other options do not typically present with Auer rods: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) involves lymphoblasts, not myeloblasts; Myelodysplastic syndrome usually presents with cytopenias and dysplastic cells but not Auer rods; Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) involves mature lymphocytes, not blasts.",9
5647,"The patient presents with hypotension, jugular venous distension, and faint heart sounds, which are classic signs of cardiac tamponade (Beck's triad). These symptoms, along with the mechanism of injury (car accident), suggest the possibility of a pericardial effusion leading to tamponade. The most appropriate next step in management is to confirm the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade. Transthoracic echocardiography is a non-invasive, rapid, and effective method to visualize the pericardial space and assess for the presence of fluid, making it the best choice to confirm tamponade in this scenario.",9
5656,"The patient has experienced persistent sadness and difficulty concentrating for the past 6 weeks, which could suggest a depressive episode. However, he also reports feeling down most of the time for the past 4 years, with only brief periods of relief lasting less than a month. This chronic pattern of depressive symptoms without significant breaks aligns with persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), which is characterized by a depressed mood for most of the day, more days than not, for at least 2 years in adults. Major depressive disorder typically involves more severe symptoms and episodes that last at least 2 weeks, but the chronicity here points more towards persistent depressive disorder. Cyclothymic disorder involves mood swings that are less severe than bipolar disorder, and adjustment disorder with depressed mood is related to a specific stressor and typically resolves within 6 months of the stressor's end, which does not fit this case.",9
5655,"The patient presents with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, such as irritability, vomiting, and drowsiness, along with a large head circumference and optic disc swelling (papilledema). The CT scan shows a mass in the 4th ventricle, which is likely causing obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow. The 4th ventricle is part of the ventricular system, and a mass here can block the flow of CSF, leading to hydrocephalus. This obstruction prevents CSF from flowing normally, causing it to accumulate and increase intracranial pressure. The presence of calcifications suggests a tumor like an ependymoma, which is common in this location in children. Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism for the symptoms is cerebrospinal fluid outflow obstruction due to the mass in the 4th ventricle.",9
5653,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest a hemolytic anemia. The boy has jaundice, fatigue, and splenomegaly, which are indicative of increased red blood cell (RBC) destruction. The laboratory findings show normocytic anemia with an elevated mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and increased red cell distribution width (RDW), which are characteristic of hereditary spherocytosis. The elevated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels further support hemolysis. The family history of splenectomy in the father suggests a hereditary condition. Hereditary spherocytosis is caused by defects in proteins of the RBC membrane, such as spectrin, leading to spherocyte formation and hemolysis. Therefore, the most likely cause of these findings is defective spectrin in the RBC membrane.",9
5668,"The patient presents with symptoms and a history suggestive of atrial fibrillation, likely triggered by excessive alcohol consumption, commonly referred to as ""holiday heart syndrome."" The irregular pulse and rapid heart rate are consistent with atrial fibrillation. In atrial fibrillation, the chaotic electrical activity in the atria leads to ineffective atrial contractions, particularly in the left atrium. This can result in blood stasis and thrombus formation, especially in the left atrial appendage. The concern for ischemic stroke arises because a thrombus formed in the left atrial appendage can dislodge and travel to the cerebral circulation. Therefore, the location where a thrombus is most likely to form in this scenario is the left atrial appendage.",9
5661,"The patient presents with chest pain that occurs with exertion and resolves with rest, which is characteristic of stable angina. Stable angina is typically caused by a fixed, atherosclerotic coronary stenosis that reduces blood flow during increased demand, such as exercise. The patient's risk factors, including obesity, diabetes, smoking, and family history of early myocardial infarction, increase the likelihood of coronary artery disease. Multivessel atherosclerotic disease (option A) and sudden disruption of an atheromatous plaque (option C) are more associated with acute coronary syndromes, such as unstable angina or myocardial infarction. Intermittent coronary vasospasm (option B) is more characteristic of Prinzmetal's angina, which occurs at rest and is not related to exertion. Therefore, the most likely etiology for this patient's stable angina is fixed, atherosclerotic coronary stenosis (> 70%).",9
5659,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest Paget's disease of bone. The increased alkaline phosphatase level indicates increased bone turnover. The hearing loss and bone pain, particularly in the hip and lower back, are consistent with Paget's disease, which is characterized by an increased rate of bone remodeling. This condition involves excessive osteoclastic bone resorption followed by increased osteoblastic activity, leading to disorganized bone architecture. The normal calcium and phosphorus levels further support this diagnosis, as they are typically normal in Paget's disease.",9
5676,"The patient's behavior involves expressing an exaggerated opposite stance to his true feelings or behaviors. He preaches against alcohol consumption while secretly engaging in it. This is characteristic of reaction formation, where an individual unconsciously adopts attitudes or behaviors opposite to their true feelings to reduce anxiety or guilt.",9
5673,"The patient presents with lower abdominal pain, vaginal spotting, and a history of irregular menstrual cycles. Her last menstrual period was 8 weeks ago, and her serum β-hCG level is significantly elevated at 16,000 mIU/mL. The transvaginal ultrasound shows a 5-cm hypoechoic lesion at the junction of the fallopian tube and uterine cavity with a thin layer of myometrium surrounding it. This description is characteristic of an interstitial (or cornual) pregnancy, which is a type of ectopic pregnancy located in the interstitial part of the fallopian tube that traverses the muscular wall of the uterus. The presence of a thin layer of myometrium surrounding the lesion supports this diagnosis. The other options are less likely given the ultrasound findings and clinical presentation.",9
5692,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a cranial nerve palsy. The right eye is abducted and depressed with slight intorsion, which is characteristic of a third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) palsy. This condition often spares the lateral rectus and superior oblique muscles, which are innervated by the sixth and fourth cranial nerves, respectively. The oculomotor nerve also innervates the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, which is responsible for elevating the upper eyelid. Therefore, a third nerve palsy would likely result in ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid) on the affected side. The patient's history of diabetes and hypertension increases the risk of microvascular cranial nerve palsies. Given these considerations, the most likely additional finding in this patient is upper eyelid droop on the right eye.",9
5694,"The patient's symptoms and the presence of a neck mass suggest hyperthyroidism, likely due to a toxic adenoma or multinodular goiter, which can be caused by somatic mutations in the TSH receptor. The symptoms of anxiety, weight loss, heat intolerance, and insomnia are consistent with hyperthyroidism. The additional findings listed are also associated with hyperthyroidism, except for nonpitting edema. Nonpitting edema, particularly pretibial myxedema, is associated with Graves' disease, an autoimmune condition, rather than a somatic mutation in the TSH receptor. Therefore, the presence of nonpitting edema would suggest a different etiology, such as Graves' disease, rather than a toxic adenoma or multinodular goiter.",9
5699,"The brachial plexus is a network of nerves that innervates the upper limb. The question mentions decreased transmission in a labeled structure, which we need to identify based on the symptoms and possible impairments. 

- **Extension of the wrist and fingers (A)** is primarily controlled by the radial nerve.
- **Opposition of the thumb (B)** is controlled by the median nerve.
- **Flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joints (C)** is controlled by the ulnar and median nerves.
- **Abduction of the shoulder above 100 degrees (D)** involves the axillary nerve and the long thoracic nerve (for scapular rotation).

Given the symptoms of tingling and weakness in the left arm, and considering the common sites of injury in the brachial plexus, the radial nerve is often involved in such presentations, especially if there is weakness in the arm. The radial nerve is responsible for extension of the wrist and fingers. Therefore, impairment in this nerve would lead to difficulty in these movements.",9
5695,"The patient's symptoms are suggestive of Parkinson's disease, characterized by a resting tremor that improves with purposeful movement, stooped posture, and shuffling gait. The most effective treatment for Parkinson's disease symptoms, particularly in older patients, is carbidopa-levodopa. This combination helps replenish dopamine in the brain, addressing the underlying deficiency that causes the symptoms.",9
5707,"The patient's symptoms and clinical findings suggest systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), particularly the diffuse form. The key features include skin changes such as hardening and tightening, especially of the fingers (sclerodactyly), and pulmonary involvement indicated by dry rales and shortness of breath. In systemic sclerosis, especially the diffuse type, the most strongly associated antibody is anti-DNA topoisomerase I, also known as anti-Scl-70. This antibody is linked to more severe disease, including pulmonary fibrosis, which aligns with the patient's respiratory symptoms.",9
5700,"The patient presents with recurrent respiratory infections, failure to thrive, and diffuse emphysema on chest radiograph. The normal sweat chloride test rules out cystic fibrosis (A). The normal nitroblue tetrazolium test suggests normal neutrophil function, ruling out chronic granulomatous disease (D). Wilson’s disease (C) typically presents with liver dysfunction and neurological symptoms, not primarily respiratory issues, and the bilirubin levels are normal here. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (B) can cause emphysema in young patients due to a deficiency in the enzyme that protects the lungs from neutrophil elastase. The elevated liver enzymes could also suggest liver involvement, which is consistent with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.",9
5715,"The patient is presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with eclampsia, which is characterized by seizures, hypertension, and proteinuria during pregnancy. The neurological findings, including paralysis of the left conjugate gaze and right hemiplegia, suggest a possible intracerebral event. In eclampsia, one potential complication is a hemorrhagic stroke, which could explain the focal neurological deficits. A hemorrhagic stroke would appear on a CT scan as a hyperdense (bright) area due to the presence of blood. Given the neurological deficits and the context of eclampsia, the most likely finding on a CT scan would be a hemorrhagic stroke, which corresponds to option C: regions of hyperdensity in the left pons, as this would explain the right-sided hemiplegia and left eye deviation.",9
5732,"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl groups from histone proteins, leading to tighter coiling of DNA around histones and reduced gene expression. Inhibition of HDACs prevents the removal of acetyl groups, resulting in increased acetylation of histones. This increased acetylation reduces the positive charge on histones, decreasing their interaction with the negatively charged DNA. Consequently, the chromatin structure becomes more relaxed, allowing for increased accessibility of transcriptional machinery to DNA and promoting gene transcription. Therefore, a histone deacetylase inhibitor would lead to relaxation of DNA coiling.",9
5722,"The patient is a 15-year-old girl with primary amenorrhea, delayed development, and specific physical findings. She has a short neck with excessive skin, which suggests a webbed neck, a common feature in Turner syndrome. Additionally, she has diminished femoral pulses compared to brachial pulses, indicating possible coarctation of the aorta, another condition associated with Turner syndrome. The atrophic legs and poor muscle development could be due to decreased blood flow from the coarctation. Turner syndrome is characterized by the presence of a single X chromosome (45,X) and is associated with short stature, delayed puberty, and congenital heart defects like coarctation of the aorta. The other options do not fit the combination of symptoms and physical findings as well as Turner syndrome does.",9
5730,"The patient's liver biopsy shows excessive intracellular fat accumulation, hepatocyte ballooning, and perivenular infiltration of lymphocytes and neutrophils without significant fibrosis. These findings are indicative of steatohepatitis, which is inflammation of the liver with fat accumulation. The key point here is the absence of significant fibrosis, which rules out cirrhosis. 

The patient has a history of consuming a can of beer every night for 10 years, which is a moderate amount of alcohol. However, his liver enzyme levels are only mildly elevated, and the GGT is within normal limits, which does not strongly suggest alcoholic liver disease. Additionally, the biopsy findings are more consistent with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) rather than alcoholic hepatitis, as alcoholic hepatitis typically presents with more severe liver enzyme elevations and often with more fibrosis.

Given the patient's obesity (BMI of 31 kg/m2) and diabetes, he is at risk for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The absence of significant fibrosis and the specific histological findings support a diagnosis of NASH rather than alcoholic liver disease.

Therefore, the best description of these findings is nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.",9
5733,"The patient has a testicular mass that was found to be choriocarcinoma upon histopathological examination. Choriocarcinoma is a type of non-seminomatous germ cell tumor that is known to produce beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG). This tumor marker is often elevated in cases of choriocarcinoma due to the presence of syncytiotrophoblastic cells, which are responsible for the production of beta-hCG. The other options, such as carcinoembryonic antigen, prostate-specific antigen, and placental alkaline phosphatase, are not typically associated with choriocarcinoma. Therefore, the most likely elevated tumor marker in this patient is beta-human chorionic gonadotropin.",9
5734,"The clinical presentation of the 7-year-old boy includes fatigue, weight loss, fever, and left upper quadrant tenderness with a mass, which suggests splenomegaly. These symptoms are concerning for a hematologic malignancy, particularly leukemia. The options provided relate to specific findings associated with different types of leukemia or infections. 

- Auer rods on peripheral smear are indicative of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is less common in children compared to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
- Infection sensitive to oseltamivir suggests influenza, which does not match the presentation of splenomegaly and significant weight loss.
- Smudge cells on peripheral smear are associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which is rare in children.
- TdT positive cells are indicative of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which is the most common type of leukemia in children and fits the presentation of fatigue, weight loss, fever, and splenomegaly.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis given the age and symptoms is ALL, which is characterized by TdT positive cells.",9
5739,"The patient's symptoms and findings suggest a fungal infection rather than tuberculosis. The negative PPD test and absence of acid-fast bacilli in the sputum make TB less likely. The presence of yeast forms replicating by narrow-based budding in the sputum is indicative of Blastomyces dermatitidis, which is known to cause blastomycosis. This condition can present with respiratory symptoms, skin lesions like erythema nodosum, and systemic symptoms such as weight loss and night sweats. The cavitary lesions in the lung apices seen on CT are also consistent with blastomycosis. To confirm the diagnosis of blastomycosis, a urine histoplasma antigen test can be useful, as it can cross-react with Blastomyces antigens and aid in diagnosis.",9
5720,"The patient is a 27-year-old man with symptoms of chest pain, cough, and shortness of breath, along with fever and tachycardia. He is cachectic and has bilateral pleural friction rubs, which suggest pleuritis. The presence of antecubital track marks indicates intravenous drug use. Given these findings, infective endocarditis is a strong possibility, especially considering the echocardiogram was performed, which is often used to assess for vegetations on heart valves in suspected endocarditis cases. Pulmonary embolism could also present with similar symptoms, but the presence of track marks and the likelihood of endocarditis in IV drug users makes infective endocarditis more probable. Tuberculosis could cause similar symptoms, but the acute presentation and the context of IV drug use make infective endocarditis more likely. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is less likely given the presentation and risk factors.",9
5743,"The patient's symptoms and the description of the rash suggest Lyme disease, which is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. The characteristic rash, erythema migrans, is often described as a ""bull's-eye"" rash. Lyme disease is commonly associated with outdoor activities in areas where the disease is endemic, such as the northeastern United States, including Vermont. The natural reservoir for Borrelia burgdorferi is the white-footed mouse. The bacterium is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Ixodes ticks, which acquire the bacterium from feeding on infected mice. Therefore, the natural reservoir of the pathogen is the mouse.",9
5742,"The patient's symptoms of numbness, tingling, decreased sensation, and decreased reflexes are indicative of peripheral neuropathy, a common side effect of certain chemotherapy drugs. Among the options provided, the drug mechanism most commonly associated with peripheral neuropathy is the inhibition of microtubule formation. Drugs like vincristine and paclitaxel, which inhibit microtubule formation, are well-known for causing peripheral neuropathy as a side effect. Other mechanisms listed, such as alkylation of DNA, DNA strand breaking, and inhibition of folate metabolism, are not typically associated with peripheral neuropathy.",9
5751,"The patient is experiencing symptoms that are characteristic of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These include nightmares and flashbacks related to the traumatic event, difficulty sleeping, and problems with concentration. These symptoms have been present for 6 weeks. PTSD is diagnosed when symptoms persist for more than one month following exposure to a traumatic event. Schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder are not consistent with the symptoms described, as they typically involve psychotic symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations, which are not present here. A normal reaction to trauma would not typically include persistent and distressing symptoms like those described for this duration. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is PTSD.",9
5750,"The bacteria in question is a gram-positive, spore-forming bacillus, which narrows it down to a few possibilities, including Bacillus and Clostridium species. The Nagler's test is specifically used to identify Clostridium perfringens, which produces an alpha toxin that hydrolyzes phospholipids, leading to an area of opacity on egg yolk agar. The presence of an antitoxin on one half of the plate that prevents this hydrolysis indicates that the test is targeting the alpha toxin of Clostridium perfringens. The other options (tetanus toxin, exotoxin A, and diphtheria toxin) are not related to phospholipid hydrolysis or the Nagler's test.",9
5764,"The presentation of an itchy rash on the fingers where the rings are worn suggests a contact dermatitis, likely allergic in nature. Nickel is a common allergen found in jewelry and is known to cause allergic contact dermatitis. The fact that the rash appeared after receiving and wearing the silver rings supports the likelihood of a nickel allergy, as nickel is often used in jewelry alloys. The other metals listed (cobalt, mercury, thorium) are less commonly associated with jewelry and allergic reactions in this context.",9
5763,"The patient experienced a transient ischemic attack (TIA), as indicated by the sudden onset of neurological symptoms that resolved within minutes. The presence of a left-sided carotid bruit and carotid ultrasound findings suggest carotid artery disease, but the stenosis is not severe enough to warrant surgical intervention like carotid endarterectomy, which is typically considered for stenosis greater than 70% in symptomatic patients. Intravenous alteplase is not indicated as the symptoms have resolved, and it is used for acute ischemic stroke with persistent symptoms. A transthoracic echocardiogram is not immediately necessary as there is no indication of a cardiac source of embolism. The most appropriate management for TIA to prevent future strokes includes antiplatelet therapy, such as aspirin, to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events.",9
5767,"The patient is showing signs of magnesium toxicity, which include somnolence, hypopnea, absent deep tendon reflexes, and muscle weakness. Magnesium sulfate is used to prevent seizures in preeclampsia, but excessive levels can lead to respiratory depression and neuromuscular blockade. The immediate management step is to address the magnesium toxicity by discontinuing the magnesium sulfate infusion.",9
5770,"The patient is a tall, young man who suddenly developed difficulty breathing while smoking, which is a classic presentation for a spontaneous pneumothorax. The physical exam findings of hyperresonance and absent breath sounds over the left upper lung suggest the presence of air in the pleural space, consistent with a pneumothorax. A tension pneumothorax would typically present with more severe symptoms, such as hypotension and tracheal deviation, which are not described here. Left lower lobe pneumonia would present with dullness to percussion and possibly crackles, not hyperresonance. The clinical presentation and physical exam findings strongly suggest a spontaneous pneumothorax, making further imaging unnecessary for diagnosis.",9
5776,"The newborn is premature at 28 weeks' gestation and presents with respiratory distress shortly after birth. The symptoms and chest x-ray findings are consistent with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS), also known as hyaline membrane disease. This condition is primarily due to a deficiency of surfactant, which is produced by type II pneumocytes. Surfactant is stored in lamellar bodies, and a low concentration of lamellar bodies indicates insufficient surfactant production. Premature infants are at high risk for this condition because surfactant production typically increases significantly after 34 weeks of gestation. The ground-glass opacities and air bronchograms on the x-ray are classic findings for NRDS. Therefore, the pathogenesis of this patient's disease is best described by a low concentration of lamellar bodies, indicating surfactant deficiency.",9
5789,"The infant in the scenario presents with features consistent with DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome), which includes cleft palate, cardiac defects (such as Tetralogy of Fallot, indicated by the boot-shaped heart and echocardiography findings), low-set ears, micrognathia, and absence of the thymus. DiGeorge syndrome is associated with hypocalcemia due to parathyroid gland hypoplasia, which can lead to seizures. The other options do not align with the typical features of DiGeorge syndrome: a catlike cry is associated with Cri du chat syndrome, hyperthyroidism is not a typical feature of DiGeorge syndrome, and webbing of the neck is associated with Turner syndrome.",9
5785,"The patient presents with worsening fibromyalgia pain and symptoms suggestive of depression, including anhedonia, low energy, and suicidal ideation. While addressing the pain is important, the immediate concern is the patient's mental health, particularly her suicidal thoughts. The best next step is to assess the severity of her suicidal ideation. Option C, asking if she has an idea about how she might hurt herself, is crucial to determine the level of risk and need for immediate intervention. This assessment will guide whether urgent psychiatric intervention is necessary.",9
5774,"The presentation of vesicles and flaccid bullae with thin brown crusts on the chest, along with the positive Nikolsky sign (sloughing of skin with lateral traction), suggests a superficial blistering disorder. The absence of oral mucosal involvement helps differentiate between conditions. Bullous impetigo is characterized by superficial blisters and crusting, often caused by Staphylococcus aureus, and does not typically involve mucosal surfaces. Dermatitis herpetiformis is associated with celiac disease and presents with intensely pruritic papules and vesicles, usually on extensor surfaces, not the chest. Stevens-Johnson syndrome involves mucosal surfaces and systemic symptoms, which are not present here. Pemphigus vulgaris involves mucosal surfaces and deeper blisters, which are not consistent with this case. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is bullous impetigo.",9
5809,"The patient is exhibiting symptoms consistent with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), characterized by intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors. First-line treatment for OCD typically includes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as sertraline. However, the question states that the first-line medication has been ineffective after eight weeks. In such cases, augmentation with an atypical antipsychotic like risperidone can be considered to help improve symptoms. Propranolol is used for performance anxiety, phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor not typically used for OCD, and sertraline is already implied as the first-line treatment that was ineffective.",9
5805,"The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, vomiting, and watery diarrhea, along with the recent travel history to Central America, suggest a case of traveler's diarrhea. The stool culture shows gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria that ferment lactose, which is characteristic of Escherichia coli. Among the toxins listed, the heat-labile toxin is associated with Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), a common cause of traveler's diarrhea. The heat-labile toxin increases cAMP levels, leading to increased secretion of electrolytes and water into the intestinal lumen, causing watery diarrhea. Other options like cereulide, enterotoxin B, and Shiga toxin are associated with different bacteria and clinical presentations.",9
5811,"The scenario describes a sexually active woman with multiple partners who has undergone a routine Pap smear. The question asks about the cellular changes seen in the Pap smear. In the context of a Pap smear, cellular changes are often related to HPV (Human Papillomavirus) infection. High-risk HPV types, such as HPV 16 and 18, are known to cause cervical dysplasia and cancer by interfering with tumor suppressor proteins. HPV produces E6 and E7 proteins, which inhibit p53 and Rb, respectively. Inhibition of p53 by the E6 protein leads to uncontrolled cell division and contributes to the development of cervical dysplasia and cancer. Therefore, the cellular changes seen in the Pap smear are attributable to the inhibition of p53 by HPV.",9
5806,"The patient presents with abdominal pain, jaundice, hepatomegaly, and ascites, which are indicative of liver dysfunction. The negative viral panel rules out viral hepatitis. The ultrasound shows hepatic vein thrombosis, and the liver biopsy reveals congestion and necrosis in the central zones, which are characteristic findings of Budd-Chiari syndrome. This condition is caused by obstruction of the hepatic venous outflow, leading to liver congestion and necrosis. The use of oral contraceptive pills is a known risk factor for Budd-Chiari syndrome due to their pro-thrombotic effects. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and drug-induced hepatitis do not typically present with hepatic vein thrombosis or the specific biopsy findings seen here.",9
5804,"The patient presents with palpitations and an irregularly irregular pulse, which is suggestive of atrial fibrillation (AF). The absence of P-waves on the ECG supports this diagnosis. The history of alcohol consumption, often referred to as ""holiday heart syndrome,"" is a common trigger for AF in otherwise healthy individuals. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he has no structural heart disease or valvular abnormalities on echocardiography. After one hour, the ECG shows normal sinus rhythm, indicating that the AF has spontaneously converted back to normal rhythm. Since the patient is now in normal sinus rhythm and is hemodynamically stable, the most appropriate next step is observation. There is no need for adenosine, defibrillation, or electrical cardioversion as the rhythm has already converted spontaneously.",10
5815,"The patient presents with a long-standing, painless enlargement of the scrotum that transilluminates, suggesting a hydrocele. The key detail is the location in southeast Asia, where lymphatic filariasis is endemic. This condition is caused by parasitic infections (e.g., Wuchereria bancrofti) that lead to lymphatic obstruction. The obstruction results in decreased lymphatic fluid absorption, causing fluid accumulation and hydrocele formation. The episodic fever could be related to the inflammatory response to the parasitic infection. Therefore, the underlying mechanism is decreased lymphatic fluid absorption due to lymphatic obstruction from filariasis.",9
5817,"The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea (including bloody stools), fever, and the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the stool suggest an invasive bacterial gastroenteritis. The history of attending an international food festival and the symptoms point towards a foodborne illness. 

- **Reheated rice** is often associated with Bacillus cereus, which typically causes vomiting and non-bloody diarrhea, not bloody diarrhea with fever.
- **Yogurt dip** could potentially be contaminated with bacteria like Salmonella or Shigella, which can cause bloody diarrhea and fever. However, yogurt itself is less commonly associated with such infections unless contaminated.
- **Toxic mushrooms** cause symptoms related to poisoning, such as liver failure or neurological symptoms, rather than infectious diarrhea.
- **Omelette** could be contaminated with Salmonella, which is a common cause of bloody diarrhea and fever.

Given the symptoms and the context, the most likely cause is an infection from a food item that can harbor bacteria like Salmonella. Eggs in an omelette are a common source of Salmonella, which matches the clinical presentation.",9
5818,"The patient is a 72-year-old man with lymphocytosis noted on blood work, mild lymphadenopathy, and a specific immunophenotype on flow cytometry. The flow cytometry results show a population of cells that are CD5, CD19, CD20, and CD23 positive. This immunophenotype is characteristic of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CLL is a common leukemia in older adults and often presents with lymphocytosis and lymphadenopathy. The other options do not fit the clinical picture or the flow cytometry findings. Tuberculosis would not present with these flow cytometry markers. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia typically presents with a different immunophenotype and is more common in children. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura would not present with lymphocytosis or these flow cytometry findings.",9
5820,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are suggestive of emphysema, a form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) commonly associated with long-term smoking. Emphysema is characterized by the destruction of alveolar walls, leading to decreased elastic recoil of the lungs. This results in air trapping and hyperinflation, which is why the patient has an increased anteroposterior chest diameter (barrel chest) and pursed-lip breathing to help with expiration. The decreased elastic recoil is a hallmark of emphysema, as the destruction of elastic fibers in the lung tissue reduces the lung's ability to return to its original shape after inhalation.",9
5826,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), including leg pain, swelling, and a positive Homan's sign (pain behind the knee on dorsiflexion of the foot). Her recent long flight from Taiwan, use of oral contraceptive pills, and elevated D-dimer levels support this diagnosis. Oral contraceptive pills are known to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism by affecting coagulation factors, including decreasing protein S levels, which is a natural anticoagulant. This decrease in protein S leads to a hypercoagulable state, increasing the risk of DVT. The other options do not fit the clinical scenario: decreased fibrinogen would lead to bleeding, ADAMTS13 deficiency is associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and vitamin K supplementation would affect vitamin K-dependent clotting factors but is not directly related to this presentation.",9
5831,"The clinical presentation suggests the child may have ingested a toxic substance. The key details are the odorless liquid and the symptoms of lethargy and vomiting. Ingestion of methanol or ethylene glycol (both odorless) could cause these symptoms. Methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning are treated with fomepizole, which inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase, preventing the formation of toxic metabolites. The other options do not match the likely cause: glucagon is used for beta-blocker overdose, epinephrine for anaphylaxis, and sodium bicarbonate for tricyclic antidepressant overdose or metabolic acidosis. Therefore, the most appropriate antidote for this scenario is fomepizole.",9
5829,"The patient is experiencing symptoms consistent with overflow incontinence, which is often due to bladder atony or underactivity. This condition is common in patients with long-standing diabetes due to autonomic neuropathy affecting the bladder. The key findings are the sensation of incomplete bladder emptying, a palpable suprapubic mass (likely a distended bladder), and increased post-void residual volume. These suggest that the bladder is not emptying properly, leading to overflow incontinence. Intermittent catheterization is the most appropriate intervention as it helps to regularly empty the bladder, preventing overdistention and reducing incontinence episodes.",9
5832,"The clinical presentation of the patient suggests an opioid overdose, characterized by unconsciousness, respiratory depression, and pinpoint pupils. In such cases, the drug commonly administered by first responders is naloxone (Narcan), which is an opioid antagonist. Naloxone works by competitively binding to opioid receptors, particularly the mu receptors, which are primarily responsible for the effects of opioids such as respiratory depression and miosis. By antagonizing these receptors, naloxone reverses the effects of opioid overdose. Therefore, the mechanism of action of the drug administered is as a mu receptor antagonist.",10
5828,"The clinical presentation of the boy suggests Prader-Willi syndrome, which is characterized by hyperphagia, obesity, behavioral problems, and hypogonadism (e.g., undescended testes). The physical features such as almond-shaped eyes and a thin upper lip also align with this condition. Prader-Willi syndrome is caused by the loss of function of genes on the paternal chromosome 15, specifically due to a deletion or other genetic mechanisms affecting the paternal allele. The most common cause is a deletion on the paternal chromosome 15q11-q13 region. However, the option that fits this scenario is the methylation of the maternal chromosome 15, which leads to the same phenotype due to the lack of expression of the paternal genes. This is because the maternal chromosome 15 is normally methylated (imprinted) and not expressed, so if the paternal genes are deleted or otherwise non-functional, the result is Prader-Willi syndrome.",9
5850,"The key finding in this patient's laboratory results is the elevated potassium level (hyperkalemia) at 6.7 mEq/L. Given the patient's history of diabetes, myocardial infarction, and hypertension, it is likely that he is on medications such as ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or potassium-sparing diuretics, which can cause hyperkalemia. Dietary changes could contribute to hyperkalemia if the patient is consuming a high-potassium diet, but medications are a more common cause in this clinical context. Hemolysis could cause a false elevation in potassium, but it is less likely given the clinical scenario. Rhabdomyolysis would typically present with muscle pain and elevated creatine kinase levels, which are not mentioned here. Therefore, the most likely cause of the hyperkalemia in this patient is medication.",9
5836,"The patient presents with right upper quadrant pain, fever, and a liver lesion on ultrasound. His history of bloody diarrhea 5 months ago and recent immigration from Mexico are key clues. The ultrasound shows a hypoechoic lesion with low-level internal echoes, suggesting a liver abscess. Amebiasis, caused by Entamoeba histolytica, is common in Mexico and can lead to liver abscesses following intestinal infection. The history of bloody diarrhea supports an initial intestinal infection. The laboratory findings show leukocytosis and mildly elevated liver enzymes, which are consistent with an abscess. Hepatic hydatid cysts, caused by Echinococcus, are less likely given the lack of eosinophilia and typical ultrasound findings. Pyogenic liver abscesses are possible but less likely without a history of biliary disease or other risk factors. Hepatocellular carcinoma is unlikely given the patient's age and lack of risk factors such as chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis.",9
5842,"The patient presents with symptoms of pelvic discomfort, heavy menstrual bleeding, and an irregularly-shaped uterus. These symptoms are suggestive of uterine fibroids (leiomyomas), which are common in women of reproductive age and can cause the symptoms described. The negative pregnancy test rules out pregnancy as a cause of the uterine enlargement. 

The most appropriate next step in diagnosing uterine fibroids is imaging to visualize the uterus. Pelvic ultrasound is the most accessible, cost-effective, and non-invasive method to evaluate the uterus and confirm the presence of fibroids. It can provide information on the size, number, and location of the fibroids. 

Laparoscopy is more invasive and typically used for direct visualization of pelvic organs when other imaging is inconclusive or when surgical intervention is planned. Pelvic MRI is more detailed but is usually reserved for complex cases or when ultrasound findings are inconclusive. Repeating the β-HCG test is unnecessary given the negative result and the clinical presentation consistent with fibroids.",9
5843,"The patient's presentation is consistent with a pneumothorax, likely a spontaneous pneumothorax given his history of COPD and smoking. The sudden onset of dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain, along with decreased breath sounds, hyperresonance on percussion, and decreased tactile fremitus on the right side, suggest air in the pleural space. In patients with COPD, especially those with a history of smoking, the rupture of an apical alveolar bleb is a common cause of spontaneous pneumothorax. The trachea being midline and the absence of heart murmurs further support this diagnosis, as there is no indication of tension pneumothorax or cardiac involvement.",9
5851,"The patient presents with bilateral lower extremity swelling after starting a new medication for hypertension. This suggests the possibility of a side effect related to the medication. Among antihypertensive medications, calcium channel blockers, particularly dihydropyridines like amlodipine, are known to cause peripheral edema as a side effect. This is due to preferential dilation of precapillary vessels (arterioles) leading to increased hydrostatic pressure in capillaries and subsequent fluid leakage into the interstitial space. The mechanism of action of these drugs is the inhibition of calcium channels, which reduces vascular smooth muscle contraction and lowers blood pressure. Other options like hormone receptor inhibition, potassium-sparing diuretics, and potassium-wasting diuretics do not typically cause this type of edema as a side effect.",9
5853,"The patient presents with dysuria (painful urination) and a history of unprotected sexual intercourse, which raises suspicion for a sexually transmitted infection (STI). The urinalysis shows leukocyte esterase and white blood cells, indicating inflammation or infection, but the urine culture is negative, suggesting a non-bacterial cause. 

Chlamydia trachomatis is a common cause of non-gonococcal urethritis and often presents with dysuria and pyuria (white blood cells in urine) without bacterial growth on culture, as it is an intracellular organism not detected on standard urine cultures.

Herpes simplex virus can cause painful urination if there are genital lesions, but the absence of lesions makes this less likely.

Systemic lupus erythematosus is unlikely given the acute presentation and lack of systemic symptoms.

Treponema pallidum causes syphilis, which typically presents with a painless chancre in the primary stage, not dysuria.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is Chlamydia trachomatis.",9
5855,"In this scenario, the child is in a life-threatening situation where medical intervention is necessary to save the limb and potentially the child's life. The parents' refusal of treatment based on misinformation poses a significant risk to the child's health. In such cases, the physician has an ethical and legal obligation to act in the best interest of the child. While respecting parental authority is important, the child's welfare takes precedence when their life or limb is at risk. Therefore, the appropriate action is to involve the hospital Ethics Committee, state authority, and child protective services to ensure the child receives the necessary medical care. If these steps take too long, seeking a court order to proceed with the treatment plan is warranted.",9
5864,"The question describes a process of labeling cells with fluorescent antibodies specific to surface proteins and then analyzing them using flow cytometry. The scatter plot shows that most cells are positive for CD8 surface protein. CD8 is a marker typically found on cytotoxic T lymphocytes, also known as CD8+ T cells. These cells are responsible for directly killing infected or cancerous cells. In contrast, regulatory T cells are usually CD4+CD25+, B lymphocytes express CD19 or CD20, and helper T lymphocytes are CD4+. Therefore, the presence of CD8 surface protein indicates that the cells are most likely mature cytotoxic T lymphocytes.",9
5868,"In the context of trauma and potential hemorrhagic shock, the body's initial compensatory response is to maintain perfusion to vital organs. The first physiologic response to blood loss is typically an increase in heart rate (tachycardia) to compensate for decreased blood volume and maintain cardiac output. This occurs before changes in blood pressure or respiratory rate. Increased capillary refill time and decreased systolic blood pressure are later signs of shock. Therefore, the first response in this scenario is an increased heart rate.",9
5884,"The infundibulopelvic ligament, also known as the suspensory ligament of the ovary, contains the ovarian vessels. During surgery involving this ligament, the structure most at risk of injury is the ureter. The ureter runs close to the ovarian vessels and can be inadvertently damaged during dissection of the infundibulopelvic ligament.",9
5883,"The patient is a young man who experienced syncope while exerting himself, which is a key clue. The presence of a systolic murmur that disappears with maneuvers that increase venous return (such as passive leg elevation) suggests a dynamic obstruction, which is characteristic of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). HCM is known for causing syncope during exertion due to outflow obstruction. The murmur associated with HCM is typically a systolic ejection murmur heard best at the left sternal border, which matches the description in the vignette. The absence of confusion post-syncope and the history of dizziness during exercise further support this diagnosis. Other options like prolonged QT interval, bicuspid aortic valve, and mitral valve prolapse do not fit the clinical picture as well as HCM does.",9
5890,"Delayed puberty in males is typically defined by the absence of testicular enlargement by age 14. Testicular enlargement is usually the first sign of puberty in boys, and its absence by this age suggests a delay. Linear growth acceleration, gynecomastia, and pubic hair distribution are secondary signs that follow testicular enlargement. Therefore, the absence of testicular enlargement by age 14 is the most direct indicator of delayed puberty in this scenario.",9
5892,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are suggestive of subacute thyroiditis (de Quervain's thyroiditis). This condition often follows a viral infection and is characterized by neck pain, tenderness of the thyroid gland, and symptoms of hyperthyroidism due to the release of thyroid hormones from the inflamed gland. The elevated ESR supports an inflammatory process. The most appropriate treatment for the pain and inflammation associated with subacute thyroiditis is the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin or ibuprofen. Levothyroxine is not indicated as the patient is currently hyperthyroid. Increasing dietary iodine is not relevant here, and reassurance alone would not address the pain and inflammation.",9
5891,"The patient's symptoms include increased forgetfulness, unsteady gait, and urinary urgency. These symptoms are classic for normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), which is characterized by the triad of gait disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, and urinary incontinence. The gait disturbance in NPH is often described as a magnetic or broad-based gait. The cognitive dysfunction can present as forgetfulness and difficulty concentrating, as seen in this patient. Urinary urgency or incontinence is also a common symptom. The normal urinalysis rules out a urinary tract infection as a cause of the urinary symptoms. The other options do not fit as well: vascular dementia typically presents with a stepwise decline and focal neurological deficits; frontotemporal dementia usually presents with personality changes and language difficulties; Lewy body dementia is characterized by visual hallucinations and parkinsonism, which are not present here.",9
5895,"The clinical presentation and microbiological findings suggest an infection with Nocardia species. The key points are the gram-positive, weakly acid-fast, branching filamentous organisms. Nocardia is known for causing skin infections, especially after trauma, and is characterized by these microbiological features. The treatment of choice for Nocardia infections is Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.",9
5898,"Total lung capacity (TLC) is the volume of air in the lungs at the end of a maximal inhalation. In patients with obstructive lung disease, such as emphysema, air trapping can occur, leading to an increase in residual volume and TLC. Traditional methods like open-circuit nitrogen washout and closed-circuit helium dilution may underestimate TLC in these patients because they rely on the assumption that all parts of the lung are equally ventilated, which may not be true in the presence of air trapping. Body plethysmography, on the other hand, measures the total volume of gas in the thorax, including any trapped air, by using Boyle's law to calculate lung volumes based on pressure changes in a closed chamber. Therefore, body plethysmography is the most accurate method for measuring TLC, especially in patients with potential air trapping.",9
5903,"The patient is experiencing severe and persistent epistaxis (nosebleed) that has not responded to conservative measures, including anterior and posterior nasal packing. This suggests a posterior source of bleeding, which is often due to the sphenopalatine artery. In cases where nasal packing fails to control the bleeding, surgical intervention is required. The most common and effective surgical procedure for posterior epistaxis is the endoscopic ligation of the sphenopalatine artery, as it is the primary source of posterior nasal bleeding. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform an endoscopic ligation of the sphenopalatine artery.",9
5899,"The patient presents with signs of a tension pneumothorax, which include difficulty breathing, pleuritic chest pain, jugular venous distention, absence of breath sounds on the affected side, hyperresonance to percussion, and tracheal deviation away from the affected side. In a tension pneumothorax, air accumulates in the pleural space and causes increased intrathoracic pressure, leading to cardiovascular compromise. The immediate management of a tension pneumothorax is to relieve the pressure by performing a needle thoracostomy. The standard site for needle decompression is the 2nd intercostal space at the midclavicular line. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is needle thoracostomy at the 2nd intercostal space, midclavicular line.",9
5904,"The patient has elevated total cholesterol and low HDL cholesterol, which indicates dyslipidemia. The primary goal in managing dyslipidemia, especially in a patient with risk factors such as hypertension and smoking, is to lower LDL cholesterol. Statins, or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, are the first-line treatment for lowering LDL cholesterol and reducing cardiovascular risk. The patient's LDL cholesterol level is not provided, but given the total cholesterol and HDL levels, it is likely elevated. Statins are also beneficial in patients with a history of hypertension and smoking due to their cardiovascular protective effects. Other options like cholesterol absorption inhibitors, PCSK9 inhibitors, and bile acid resins are not first-line treatments for this scenario.",9
5866,"The presentation is consistent with panic disorder, characterized by recurrent episodes of intense fear (panic attacks) with physical symptoms such as chest pain, palpitations, and tremulousness. These episodes occur unpredictably, not exclusively in specific situations or under the influence of substances. The patient’s concern about these episodes affecting his work further supports the impact on his daily life, typical of panic disorder. The normal thyroid tests and negative toxicology screen help rule out other causes. In panic disorder, long-term management options include SSRIs as long-term pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as an effective non-pharmacologic treatment. SSRIs like fluoxetine are the first-line pharmacological treatments. However, the question asks for first-line therapy for long-term management in general, not specifically pharmacologic. Therefore, CBT, which is an evidence-based non-pharmacologic first-line therapy for panic disorder, is appropriate given the patient's prior issues with medication compliance.",9
5910,"The patient is a 27-year-old African American man with a history of severe pain episodes treated with morphine, which suggests a possible sickle cell crisis. The laboratory findings show anemia with a low hemoglobin (8 g/dL) and hematocrit (28%), and a low mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 72 um^3, indicating microcytic anemia. However, the elevated LDH (540 U/L) suggests hemolysis. The normal leukocyte and platelet counts, along with normal renal and liver function tests, rule out other causes of anemia. The combination of anemia, elevated LDH, and the patient's ethnicity and pain episodes suggest hemolysis, likely due to sickle cell disease. In sickle cell disease, hemolysis is typically extravascular, occurring in the spleen. Therefore, the best explanation for the laboratory abnormalities is extravascular hemolysis.",9
5913,"This patient is a pregnant woman with HIV infection, a low CD4 count (150 cells/mm^3), and a high viral load (126,000 copies/mL). The management of HIV in pregnancy aims to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission and to maintain the health of the mother. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is recommended for all pregnant women with HIV, regardless of CD4 count or viral load, to reduce the risk of transmission to the baby and to improve maternal health. Options A, B, and D are not appropriate: A is incorrect because with a CD4 count below 200 cells/mm^3, prophylaxis for opportunistic infections like Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia is indicated. B is incorrect because breastfeeding is generally not recommended for HIV-positive mothers in settings where safe alternatives are available, due to the risk of transmission. D is incorrect because the mode of delivery is determined by the viral load near delivery; a high viral load may necessitate a cesarean section to reduce transmission risk. Therefore, the appropriate management is to initiate HAART.",9
5932,"The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and bilious vomiting, along with a history of similar episodes, suggest an obstructive process. The presence of an epigastric mass is a key finding. Given the patient's history of alcohol use, a pancreatic pseudocyst is a likely consideration. Pancreatic pseudocysts can form as a complication of chronic pancreatitis, which is often associated with heavy alcohol use. These pseudocysts can cause symptoms by compressing adjacent structures, such as the stomach or duodenum, leading to obstruction and bilious vomiting. The other options are less likely: chronic cholecystitis typically presents with right upper quadrant pain and does not usually cause an epigastric mass; retroperitoneal fibrosis is rare and would not typically present with an epigastric mass; hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is more common in infants and would not present with a mass in an adult.",9
5933,"The patient initially consented to the surgery but later withdrew her consent. Informed consent is a continuous process, and a patient has the right to withdraw consent at any time. Despite the life-threatening nature of her condition, the patient is alert, oriented, and capable of making her own medical decisions. Therefore, her decision to refuse surgery must be respected. Consulting the ethics committee or obtaining consent from her ex-husband would not be appropriate as she is competent to make her own decisions. Continuing with the surgery against her wishes would violate her autonomy.",9
5927,"The patient has chronic hepatitis C infection, as indicated by the positive hepatitis C antibody and HCV RNA. The genotype is 1, which is the most common genotype in the United States. The liver biopsy shows chronic hepatitis changes with periportal necrosis, consistent with chronic hepatitis C infection. The most appropriate treatment for chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 is a direct-acting antiviral regimen. Sofosbuvir and ledipasvir is a well-established combination for treating genotype 1 hepatitis C and is preferred over older treatments like interferon and ribavirin due to better efficacy and fewer side effects. Tenofovir and entecavir are used for hepatitis B, not hepatitis C. Tenofovir and velpatasvir is not a standard combination for hepatitis C genotype 1.",9
5936,"The patient is in a comatose state with absent brainstem reflexes, including unresponsive pupils, absent corneal reflexes, and absent gag and cough reflexes. These findings suggest brain death. In such cases, confirming brain death is crucial before any decision to withdraw life support. The next step in management is to confirm brain death, which typically involves repeating the clinical examination after a certain period to ensure the findings are consistent. Therefore, the next best step is to repeat the examination in several hours to confirm brain death.",9
5934,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest a diagnosis of sideroblastic anemia. The key findings include microcytic anemia (low MCV), elevated serum iron and ferritin, and the presence of ringed sideroblasts in the bone marrow. Sideroblastic anemia is often due to a defect in heme synthesis, specifically in the enzyme ALA synthase, which catalyzes the first step in the heme synthesis pathway: the conversion of glycine and succinyl-CoA to aminolevulinic acid (ALA). This step is crucial, and a deficiency in ALA synthase leads to the accumulation of iron in the mitochondria, forming ringed sideroblasts. The family history of a blood disorder requiring transfusions suggests a possible hereditary sideroblastic anemia, which is often linked to ALA synthase deficiency.",9
5946,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), characterized by hypertension, hematuria, flank pain, and palpable kidney masses. The condition is hereditary, and family members may also be affected. Screening for ADPKD in family members is typically done using renal ultrasound, as it is non-invasive, cost-effective, and can detect the presence of renal cysts, which are indicative of the disease. Other options like abdominal CT or renal biopsy are more invasive or expensive and not typically used for screening purposes. A voiding cystourethrogram is not relevant for this condition.",9
5950,"Hydrogen peroxide is a common disinfectant that works primarily through the formation of free radicals. When hydrogen peroxide comes into contact with tissues, it decomposes to produce reactive oxygen species, including hydroxyl radicals. These free radicals are highly reactive and can damage cellular components such as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, leading to microbial cell death. This mechanism is distinct from halogenation, crosslinking, or congealing, which are associated with other types of disinfectants.",9
5940,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are suggestive of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). The key features include fatigue, dark 'cola-colored' urine in the morning, hemoglobinuria, anemia, elevated LDH, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. PNH is caused by a deficiency of the GPI anchor proteins CD55 and CD59 on the surface of red blood cells. These proteins normally protect red blood cells from complement-mediated lysis. Their absence leads to increased susceptibility to complement attack, especially during the night when complement activity is higher, resulting in hemolysis and the characteristic dark urine. The other options do not match the presentation: 

- A deficiency of C1 esterase-inhibitor (Option A) causes hereditary angioedema, not PNH.
- A temperature-dependent IgG autoantibody (Option B) would suggest cold agglutinin disease, which does not fit the presentation.
- An autosomal recessive deficiency of platelet Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor (Option D) is associated with Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a bleeding disorder, not hemolysis.

Thus, the correct answer is the deficiency of CD-55 and CD-59 cell membrane proteins.",9
5947,"The clinical presentation described in the vignette is consistent with rubella. The key features include a rash that started on the face and neck and is now fading, fever, cough, and poor appetite. The presence of tiny rose-colored lesions on the soft palate (Forchheimer spots) and the enlarged tender lymph nodes in the suboccipital, postauricular, and anterior cervical regions are characteristic of rubella. Measles would typically present with Koplik spots in the mouth and a rash that spreads from the head to the body, but the lymphadenopathy pattern and the description of the rash are more indicative of rubella. Roseola typically presents with a high fever followed by a rash as the fever subsides, and parvovirus B19 infection often presents with a ""slapped cheek"" rash and arthralgia, which are not described here.",9
5937,"The patient's symptoms include upper and lower extremity weakness, neck pain, difficulty swallowing and speaking, spasticity, muscle atrophy, ataxic gait, dysarthria, hyperreflexia, positive Babinski sign, and decreased sensation below the C5 dermatome. These findings suggest both upper and lower motor neuron involvement, as well as sensory deficits. The presence of atrophy in the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles, along with the sensory level, points towards a structural lesion at the cervicomedullary junction. A foramen magnum meningioma could compress the spinal cord and brainstem at this level, causing both motor and sensory symptoms. The other options do not fit as well: cerebral glioblastoma multiforme would not typically cause these specific symptoms, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis does not cause sensory deficits, and syringomyelia usually presents with a ""cape-like"" sensory loss and does not typically cause such extensive motor symptoms.",9
5958,"The patient's symptoms and physical findings suggest a diagnosis of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2B (MEN 2B). The recurrent episodes of headaches, palpitations, and sweating are indicative of pheochromocytoma, which is common in MEN 2B. The firm thyroid nodule suggests medullary thyroid carcinoma, another component of MEN 2B. The multiple soft, yellow papules on the tongue are likely mucosal neuromas, also associated with MEN 2B. The long and slender extremities and hyperextensible joints suggest a marfanoid habitus, which is characteristic of MEN 2B. MEN 2B is caused by mutations in the RET proto-oncogene.",9
5960,"The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), especially given the sudden onset of a severe headache (often described as a ""thunderclap headache"") and the history of a similar headache a few days prior. The normal CT scan does not rule out SAH, as CT can miss some cases, especially if performed after a delay. The next step to confirm SAH when the CT is negative is to perform a lumbar puncture to look for xanthochromia or red blood cells in the cerebrospinal fluid. This is crucial for diagnosis. Administering oxygen and sumatriptan is more appropriate for cluster headaches, which is not the case here. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt is used for hydrocephalus, not indicated here. An MRI is not the next step for suspected SAH after a negative CT.",9
5963,"In medical ethics, accepting gifts from patients can create conflicts of interest or the appearance of impropriety. Small tokens of appreciation, like homemade food, are generally acceptable as they are unlikely to influence professional judgment. However, a $250 gift certificate is a significant gift and could be perceived as influencing the physician-patient relationship. Therefore, it is appropriate to return the gift certificate to maintain professional boundaries while keeping the homemade food, which is a more modest gesture of gratitude.",9
5974,"The patient presents with polyuria, polydipsia, confusion, and signs of dehydration. Her laboratory results show hypernatremia (Na+ 148 mEq/L) and low urine osmolality (190 mOsm/kg) compared to serum osmolality (280 mOsm/kg), indicating an inability to concentrate urine despite hypernatremia. This suggests a problem with antidiuretic hormone (ADH) function.

SIADH (A) would cause hyponatremia due to excessive water retention, which is not consistent with the hypernatremia seen here.

Psychogenic polydipsia (B) typically results in hyponatremia due to excessive water intake, which is also inconsistent with the hypernatremia.

Central diabetes insipidus (D) involves a deficiency of ADH, leading to similar symptoms, but it is less likely given the patient's history of lithium use.

Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (C) is characterized by the kidneys' inability to respond to ADH, often caused by lithium use, which fits the patient's history of bipolar disorder and lithium treatment. The hypernatremia and low urine osmolality despite normal serum osmolality further support this diagnosis.",9
5979,"The patient's initial symptoms of diarrhea, flushing, and wheezing suggest a carcinoid syndrome, which is associated with increased serotonin levels. Carcinoid tumors can lead to increased production of serotonin, which causes the flushing and diarrhea. However, serotonin synthesis from tryptophan can deplete tryptophan levels, leading to decreased synthesis of niacin (vitamin B3), as tryptophan is a precursor for niacin. Niacin deficiency can result in pellagra, characterized by diarrhea, dermatitis, and dementia. The patient's new symptoms of dry skin, rash, and memory decline are consistent with pellagra due to niacin deficiency. Therefore, the most likely cause of her recent presentation is niacin deficiency.",9
5972,"The patient is 30 years old and her last Pap smear was 3 years ago. Current guidelines recommend Pap smear with HPV co-testing every 5 years for women aged 30-65. Given her age and the fact that her last Pap smear was 3 years ago, she is due for a Pap smear and HPV testing. Mammography is generally recommended to start at age 40 for average-risk women, but given her family history of breast cancer, she may need earlier screening. However, the question asks for the most appropriate recommendation based on the information provided, which aligns with starting mammography at age 40. Therefore, the most appropriate recommendation is Pap smear and HPV testing now and every 5 years, with mammography starting at age 40.",9
5980,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure (headache, vomiting, papilledema) and cranial nerve VI palsy (limited right lateral gaze). The MR venography shows heterogeneous intensity in the left lateral sinus, indicating a possible cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). CVST can occur in patients using oral contraceptives due to increased risk of thrombosis. The most appropriate initial management for CVST is anticoagulation to prevent further clot propagation and to allow recanalization of the sinus. Dalteparin, a low molecular weight heparin, is an appropriate choice for anticoagulation in this setting.",9
5978,"The clinical presentation of the 1-year-old boy, including recurrent seizures, coarse pale hair, inelastic hypopigmented skin, generalized hypotonia, and low serum ceruloplasmin levels, is suggestive of Menkes disease. Menkes disease is a disorder of copper metabolism caused by mutations in the ATP7A gene, leading to copper deficiency. Copper is a cofactor for several enzymes, including lysyl oxidase, which is involved in the cross-linking of collagen and elastin. The symptoms of inelastic skin and connective tissue abnormalities are due to decreased activity of lysyl oxidase. Therefore, the enzyme with decreased activity responsible for this patient's condition is lysyl oxidase.",9
5981,"The patient's symptoms of fatigue and pruritus, along with the laboratory findings of elevated alkaline phosphatase and positive antimitochondrial antibodies, are suggestive of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). PBC is an autoimmune disease characterized by the destruction of small and medium-sized bile ducts within the liver. The liver biopsy in PBC typically shows lymphocytic infiltration of the portal areas and the presence of non-caseating granulomas, which are often referred to as ""florid duct lesions."" These findings are consistent with option D.",9
5982,"The situation involves a conflict between respecting patient confidentiality and addressing the spouse's concerns. The patient has explicitly stated that he does not want his spouse to know about his condition, which means the physician must respect his wishes and maintain confidentiality. The most appropriate response is to encourage open communication between the patient and his spouse without breaching confidentiality. Option A respects the patient's confidentiality while encouraging the spouse to discuss her concerns directly with her husband. Options B, C, and D either suggest actions that are not immediately appropriate or do not address the confidentiality issue correctly.",9
5993,"The patient's symptoms of watery rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, itchy eyes, and sneezing, along with the physical exam finding of edematous, boggy turbinates, are consistent with allergic rhinitis. This condition is commonly treated with intranasal corticosteroids, which help reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms. Intranasal fluticasone is a corticosteroid that is effective for this purpose. The other options, intravenous penicillin and oral amoxicillin, are antibiotics used for bacterial infections, which are not indicated here. Oral acetaminophen is an analgesic and antipyretic, which would not address the underlying allergic symptoms.",9
5996,"The patient is started on a medication to increase HDL levels. Niacin (vitamin B3) is the drug most commonly used to significantly increase HDL levels. One of the most common side effects of niacin is flushing, which is due to prostaglandin-mediated vasodilation. This side effect can be quite bothersome to patients and is often a reason for discontinuation of the drug. Other options like gallstones, hepatotoxicity, and myalgia are associated with other lipid-modifying agents such as fibrates and statins, but flushing is most characteristic of niacin.",9
6000,"The child presents with symptoms suggestive of a bacterial infection, likely streptococcal pharyngitis, given the sore throat, tonsillar exudates, and cervical lymphadenopathy. The history of immigration and lack of immunization records raise the possibility of other infections, but the presentation is most consistent with a bacterial cause. The presence of a warm, tender, nonfluctuant cervical lymph node suggests lymphadenitis, likely secondary to the pharyngitis. The most appropriate management step, pending culture results, is to start empirical antibiotic therapy. Clindamycin is effective against streptococci and staphylococci and is appropriate for treating both the pharyngitis and associated lymphadenitis. Sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine are used for toxoplasmosis, which is less likely given the presentation. Incision and drainage are not indicated for a nonfluctuant lymph node. Immunoglobulin therapy is not appropriate for this presentation.",9
6008,"The patient's symptoms of proximal muscle weakness, fatigue, and dry mouth, along with the history of smoking and the presence of a lung mass, suggest a paraneoplastic syndrome. The decreased deep tendon reflexes that increase with repetitive tapping are characteristic of Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS), which is often associated with small cell lung cancer. LEMS is caused by autoantibodies against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels, leading to impaired acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction. This is an autoimmune process triggered by the presence of the tumor.",9
6006,"The patient's symptoms and dietary habits suggest a deficiency in vitamin C, which is known to cause scurvy. The key symptoms of scurvy include swollen bleeding gums, petechiae, perifollicular hemorrhage, and corkscrew hairs, all of which are present in this patient. Vitamin C is crucial for the hydroxylation of lysine and proline residues during collagen synthesis, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of connective tissues. This deficiency leads to the symptoms observed in scurvy. Therefore, the key function of the most likely deficient nutrient, vitamin C, is the hydroxylation of lysine and proline residues in collagen synthesis.",9
6012,"The patient's symptoms are characteristic of cluster headaches. He experiences severe, unilateral headache pain localized to the right forehead and eye, which is typical of cluster headaches. The autonomic symptoms such as drooping of the eyelid (ptosis), tearing (lacrimation), and rhinorrhea on the affected side further support this diagnosis. The restlessness during the headache episodes is also a common feature of cluster headaches. The fact that the headaches occur in clusters (repeated episodes over a short period) and the lack of relief from indomethacin, which is effective for other types of headaches like paroxysmal hemicrania, also points towards cluster headaches. Migraine headaches typically last longer and are associated with nausea and photophobia, which are not mentioned here. Giant cell arteritis is unlikely given the patient's age and the absence of systemic symptoms like jaw claudication or visual disturbances. Medication overuse headache would not present with the autonomic symptoms seen here.",9
6021,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of cauda equina syndrome, including lower extremity weakness, severe back pain radiating to the legs, urinary incontinence, and saddle anesthesia. These symptoms indicate a possible compression of the cauda equina nerves, which is a medical emergency requiring immediate attention to prevent permanent neurological damage. The best course of action is to ensure the patient receives urgent evaluation and management, typically involving imaging and possibly surgical intervention. Outpatient management or non-emergent interventions are not appropriate given the severity and urgency of the symptoms.",9
6023,"The patient presents with lip edema and difficulty breathing following a dental procedure, with a history of similar episodes. The key laboratory finding is a low level of C1 esterase inhibitor. This is indicative of hereditary angioedema, a condition characterized by recurrent episodes of severe swelling (angioedema) due to a deficiency or dysfunction of C1 esterase inhibitor. The absence of urticaria and the presence of stridor further support this diagnosis over an allergic reaction or drug-induced angioedema. Contact dermatitis is unlikely given the presentation and laboratory findings.",9
6016,"The patient's symptoms and findings are suggestive of a carcinoid syndrome. The key features include flushing, diarrhea, and right-sided heart involvement (tricuspid regurgitation indicated by the holosystolic murmur that is louder during inspiration). The presence of a mass in the small intestine and liver on CT scan supports the diagnosis of a carcinoid tumor, which often metastasizes to the liver and causes systemic symptoms due to the release of serotonin and other vasoactive substances. Systemic mastocytosis could cause flushing and diarrhea but is less likely to cause the specific cardiac findings. Whipple’s disease and irritable bowel syndrome do not typically present with these cardiac and systemic symptoms.",9
6018,"The patient presents with irregular menstrual bleeding, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, elevated luteinizing hormone (LH), and elevated testosterone levels. These findings are suggestive of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is characterized by irregular menses, hyperandrogenism, and often insulin resistance. The elevated LH and testosterone levels support this diagnosis. In PCOS, transvaginal ultrasound typically shows enlarged ovaries with multiple cysts. The other options are less likely: elevated beta-HCG would suggest pregnancy, which is unlikely given the patient's sexual inactivity; an adrenal tumor would not typically present with these specific hormonal imbalances; and an intrasellar mass would suggest a pituitary issue, which doesn't align with the elevated testosterone and insulin resistance seen here.",9
6022,"The patient is a 71-year-old man with lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, along with a leukocyte count of 12,000/mm3. These findings are suggestive of a hematologic disorder. Given the age and the presence of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a likely consideration. CLL is characterized by the presence of smudge cells on a peripheral blood smear. Smudge cells are remnants of fragile lymphocytes that are disrupted during the preparation of the blood smear. The other options are less likely: ringed sideroblasts are associated with sideroblastic anemia, rouleaux formation is seen in multiple myeloma, and polycythemia involves an increased red blood cell mass, which is not indicated here.",9
6024,"The patient has a history of chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis, and presents with symptoms and imaging findings suggestive of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), also known as hepatoma. The elevated alpha fetoprotein level supports this diagnosis. In advanced-stage HCC, targeted therapy is often used. Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that is approved for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The other options listed are not used for this condition: Daclizumab is an immunosuppressant, Palivizumab is used for RSV prophylaxis, and Abciximab is an antiplatelet agent.",9
6033,"The patient presents with a flank mass, hematuria, and polycythemia (elevated hemoglobin level). These findings are suggestive of a renal mass. The CT scan confirms a large solid mass in the left kidney. The combination of a renal mass, hematuria, and polycythemia is characteristic of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). RCC can produce erythropoietin, leading to secondary polycythemia. Angiomyolipoma is typically associated with tuberous sclerosis and is not associated with polycythemia. Transitional cell carcinoma usually affects the renal pelvis and is less likely to present as a large solid renal mass. Wilms tumor is a pediatric condition and unlikely in a 63-year-old man.",9
6034,"The patient is a pregnant woman at 24 weeks' gestation presenting with fetal hydrops, as indicated by fluid accumulation within the fetal scalp and pleural effusions. The mother's recent history of low-grade fever, runny nose, painful joints, and sore throat that resolved spontaneously is suggestive of a viral infection. Parvovirus B19 is known to cause fetal hydrops due to its ability to infect fetal erythroid progenitor cells, leading to severe fetal anemia and heart failure. The symptoms described in the mother are consistent with a parvovirus infection, which often presents with mild flu-like symptoms and arthralgia in adults. Other options like herpes simplex virus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Toxoplasma gondii do not typically present with these specific maternal symptoms or cause fetal hydrops in this manner.",9
6032,"The patient's symptoms and findings are suggestive of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri. This condition is characterized by increased intracranial pressure without an identifiable cause on imaging, as evidenced by her normal MRI and elevated opening pressure on lumbar puncture. Common symptoms include headache, visual disturbances, and tinnitus. The first-line treatment for IIH is acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that reduces cerebrospinal fluid production, thereby lowering intracranial pressure. Other options like furosemide, optic nerve sheath fenestration, and ventriculoperitoneal shunting are considered in cases where acetazolamide is ineffective or if there is significant vision loss.",9
6036,"The patient's presentation is consistent with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), characterized by fever, blistering skin rash, mucosal involvement, and a positive Nikolsky sign (blister formation with lateral pressure). Lamotrigine is known to cause SJS/TEN, especially when the dose is increased too quickly. The other medications listed are less commonly associated with this severe reaction.",9
6047,"The symptoms and blood culture findings suggest meningococcal infection, likely caused by Neisseria meningitidis, which is an encapsulated gram-negative diplococcus. The fact that the patient has had this infection before suggests a possible complement deficiency, as recurrent Neisseria infections are associated with deficiencies in the terminal complement pathway (C5-C9), which is responsible for forming the membrane attack complex (MAC). A deficiency in any of these components can lead to increased susceptibility to Neisseria infections. Among the options, C9 is a component of the MAC, and its deficiency would lead to recurrent Neisseria infections.",9
6062,"The patient presents with infertility, low LH, FSH, and testosterone levels, and physical features such as a high-pitched voice, absent facial hair, and small testicular volume. These findings suggest a hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, where there is a deficiency in the secretion of gonadotropins (LH and FSH) from the pituitary gland. Kallmann Syndrome is a condition characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia (loss of smell), but anosmia is not mentioned here. However, the key features of low gonadotropins and testosterone align with Kallmann Syndrome. Fragile X Syndrome typically presents with intellectual disability and macroorchidism, which are not present here. Klinefelter Syndrome usually presents with elevated FSH and LH due to primary testicular failure, which is not the case here. Primary hypogonadism would also present with elevated FSH and LH. Therefore, the most likely cause of his infertility is Kallmann Syndrome.",9
6041,"The patient's symptoms include a painless mass in the left groin and a fluctuant, painless left scrotal swelling that increases in size with coughing. The increase in size with coughing suggests a hernia, as the intra-abdominal pressure increases during coughing, pushing abdominal contents through a defect. 

The fluctuant scrotal swelling that increases with coughing is indicative of an indirect inguinal hernia, which occurs when abdominal contents protrude through the deep inguinal ring due to a patent processus vaginalis. This is consistent with the failure of the processus vaginalis to close, allowing abdominal contents to herniate into the inguinal canal and potentially into the scrotum.

A direct inguinal hernia, which would be due to weakening of the transversalis fascia, typically presents as a bulge in the groin that does not extend into the scrotum and is less likely to fluctuate with coughing.

Obstruction of the left spermatic vein would lead to a varicocele, not a hernia.

Widening of the femoral ring would lead to a femoral hernia, which is more common in females and presents as a bulge below the inguinal ligament.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is the failure of the processus vaginalis to close, leading to an indirect inguinal hernia.",9
6065,"The patient with myasthenia gravis is experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to a myasthenic crisis. This is characterized by worsening muscle weakness, including respiratory muscles, often triggered by infections or certain medications. Gentamicin, an aminoglycoside, can exacerbate neuromuscular weakness in myasthenia gravis. The arterial blood gas shows respiratory acidosis with hypoxemia, indicating hypoventilation. In a myasthenic crisis, the immediate management after securing the airway is to improve neuromuscular transmission. Plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) are used to rapidly reduce circulating antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor, improving muscle strength. Atropine is used for cholinergic crisis, not myasthenic crisis. Edrophonium is used for diagnostic purposes, not treatment. Thymectomy is a long-term treatment option, not an acute intervention. Therefore, the next best step in management is plasmapheresis.",9
6075,"The patient has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and recurrent second-trimester miscarriages, as well as a previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT). These clinical features are suggestive of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), which is associated with SLE. APS is characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, recurrent miscarriages, and thrombotic events. The lacy, violaceous discoloration on her lower legs is likely livedo reticularis, a skin manifestation associated with APS. Therefore, the autoantibody most likely to be positive in this patient is anti-phospholipid antibodies.",9
6073,"The patient is experiencing acute dystonia, a type of extrapyramidal side effect commonly associated with antipsychotic medications like clozapine. Symptoms include muscle spasms, trismus, and oculogyric crisis (superior deviation of the eyes). The treatment for acute dystonia is an anticholinergic or antihistamine medication. Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties, is effective in treating these symptoms.",9
6071,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with severe malaria, including fever, dyspnea, impaired consciousness, dark urine (suggestive of hemolysis), and jaundice. The recent travel to the Republic of Congo, a region endemic for Plasmodium falciparum, along with the blood smear showing ring-shaped inclusions in red blood cells, supports a diagnosis of falciparum malaria. The normal NADPH production indicates that glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is not a concern, which is relevant for certain antimalarial drugs. In cases of severe malaria, especially with Plasmodium falciparum, the recommended treatment is intravenous artesunate. This is because artesunate is effective against severe malaria and can rapidly reduce parasitemia. Chloroquine is not appropriate due to widespread resistance of P. falciparum to this drug. Proguanil is used in combination with atovaquone for prophylaxis or treatment of uncomplicated malaria, not severe cases. Dapsone is not used for malaria treatment. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is artesunate.",9
6084,"The infant presents with projectile non-bilious vomiting, which is a classic symptom of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. The palpable mass in the right epigastric region, often described as an ""olive,"" further supports this diagnosis. The history of erythromycin use is relevant because it is associated with an increased risk of pyloric stenosis. The signs of dehydration, such as sunken fontanelles and dry mucous membranes, are consistent with the vomiting and poor feeding. Milk-protein allergy typically presents with bloody stools and fussiness, not projectile vomiting. Midgut volvulus and intussusception usually present with bilious vomiting and abdominal pain, which are not described here. Therefore, the most likely condition is hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.",9
6079,"The patient experienced a loss of consciousness while using the bathroom, which is a common scenario for situational syncope. Situational syncope is a type of reflex syncope that occurs due to specific triggers such as urination, defecation, or coughing. The patient's history of almost fainting again when trying to urinate in the emergency department supports this diagnosis. The presence of a systolic murmur suggests aortic stenosis, which can also cause syncope, but the situational trigger is more indicative of situational syncope. Postural hypotension is less likely given the lack of a significant drop in blood pressure upon standing. A seizure is unlikely due to the lack of postictal confusion or other neurological deficits. Cardiac arrhythmia is possible but less likely given the situational trigger and stable vital signs.",9
6094,"The clinical presentation of the girl suggests a condition characterized by multiple fractures, hearing loss, and dental abnormalities. These features are consistent with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a genetic disorder caused by defective type I collagen production. The history of multiple fractures, hearing impairment, and dental issues (brown opalescent teeth) are classic signs of OI. The other options do not fit the clinical picture: decreased cystathionine beta synthase activity is associated with homocystinuria, a fibrillin gene defect is related to Marfan syndrome, and a type III collagen gene defect is linked to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Therefore, the most likely etiology is defective type I collagen production.",9
6088,"The clinical presentation of the neonate suggests necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a condition common in premature infants. The key features include bilious vomiting, abdominal distension, lethargy, and bloody stools. The laboratory finding of metabolic acidosis supports this diagnosis. In NEC, the classic radiographic finding is pneumatosis intestinalis, which is air within the bowel wall. This is due to gas produced by bacteria in the bowel wall, which is a hallmark of NEC.",9
6086,"The patient has chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and presents with severe fatigue and dyspnea. The laboratory findings show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7 g/dL and a high mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 105 μm3, indicating macrocytic anemia. The leukocyte count is elevated at 80,000/mm3, consistent with CLL. The platelet count is normal. The total bilirubin is elevated at 6 mg/dL, with a direct bilirubin of 0.8 mg/dL, suggesting an indirect hyperbilirubinemia. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is also elevated at 650 U/L.

The combination of anemia, elevated indirect bilirubin, and elevated LDH suggests hemolysis. In CLL, autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a known complication where the immune system attacks the red blood cells, leading to hemolysis. This would explain the macrocytic anemia (due to reticulocytosis), elevated bilirubin (from breakdown of hemoglobin), and elevated LDH (from cell turnover).

Bone marrow involvement would typically cause pancytopenia, not isolated anemia with hemolysis. Evan’s syndrome involves both autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia, but the platelet count is normal here. Splenomegaly can contribute to anemia but is not the primary cause of hemolysis in this context.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's condition is autoimmune hemolytic anemia.",9
6101,"The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, presenting with bilateral blurring of vision. The key to this question is the fundoscopic examination, which is not described but is likely to show findings consistent with diabetic retinopathy, given her history of diabetes. In diabetic retinopathy, especially if there is macular edema or proliferative changes, laser photocoagulation is a common treatment to prevent further vision loss. The other options are less likely to be appropriate: topical timolol is used for glaucoma, oral ganciclovir is used for CMV retinitis, and ocular massage is used for acute angle-closure glaucoma or central retinal artery occlusion. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management for diabetic retinopathy is laser photocoagulation.",9
6108,"In designing a randomized controlled trial (RCT), ethical considerations are paramount. An RCT becomes unacceptable if it knowingly exposes participants to harm or if it withholds a treatment known to be effective. 

- Option A: The treatment not being widespread in use is not a reason to deem an RCT unacceptable. New treatments often start with limited use and are tested in RCTs to establish efficacy and safety.

- Option B: If the treatment does not represent the best known option, it could be unethical to use it in an RCT if participants are denied the best available treatment. However, this is not inherently unacceptable if the trial is designed to compare the new treatment against the current standard.

- Option C: If the treatment has a known, adverse outcome, it would be unethical to expose participants to it without a compelling reason, such as a potential for greater benefit that outweighs the risks. This makes an RCT unacceptable if the adverse outcomes are significant and not justified by potential benefits.

- Option D: The treatment being expensive does not make an RCT unacceptable. Cost is a logistical and practical concern but not an ethical one.

Therefore, the presence of a known, adverse outcome without sufficient justification for potential benefits makes an RCT unacceptable.",9
6115,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), such as nocturia and weak urinary stream. However, the presence of a firm nodule on digital rectal examination and an elevated PSA level raises suspicion for prostate cancer. In such cases, the most appropriate next step is to obtain a definitive diagnosis. A transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy is the standard procedure to confirm or rule out prostate cancer when there is a suspicion based on physical examination and PSA levels. Cystoscopy and CT scan are not indicated at this stage for the evaluation of a prostate nodule. Repeating the PSA in one year would delay diagnosis and is not appropriate given the current findings.",9
6110,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with iron deficiency anemia. The low hemoglobin, low MCV, low MCH, and high RDW, along with low serum ferritin, support this diagnosis. In iron deficiency anemia, the peripheral blood smear typically shows microcytic, hypochromic red blood cells with increased variation in size and shape, known as anisopoikilocytosis.",9
6116,"The patient is presenting with painless vaginal bleeding at 32 weeks gestation, a history of placenta previa, and fetal distress (as indicated by fetal heart rate decelerations and bradycardia). The sudden onset of bleeding and the history of placenta previa suggest the possibility of placenta previa or placental abruption. The fetal distress indicates that the fetus is not tolerating the current situation well, and immediate delivery is necessary to prevent fetal compromise. Given the history of a previous cesarean section for placenta previa, the likelihood of placenta previa in this pregnancy is high. In such cases, the best next step is to perform a cesarean section to deliver the baby and manage the bleeding. Other options like betamethasone are used for fetal lung maturity but are not appropriate in the setting of acute fetal distress. Lumbar epidural block is for pain management and not indicated here. Red blood cell transfusion may be needed later depending on the lab results, but the immediate priority is to address the fetal distress and bleeding.",9
6117,"The patient's symptoms and history are key to diagnosing his condition. He has pain in his left thigh and calf that occurs at rest and worsens with walking, which is characteristic of claudication due to peripheral artery disease (PAD). The pain is slightly improved by hanging his foot off the bed, suggesting that gravity is helping to improve blood flow, which is a classic sign of ischemia. His long history of hypertension, diabetes, and heavy smoking are significant risk factors for atherosclerosis, which can lead to PAD.

On examination, the diminished pulses in the femoral, popliteal, and dorsalis pedis arteries indicate reduced blood flow to the lower extremities, consistent with PAD. The fact that the pain occurs at rest and is relieved by dependency (hanging the foot off the bed) suggests that the patient has progressed to a more severe form of PAD known as critical limb ischemia.

Raynaud’s phenomenon typically involves episodic color changes in the fingers or toes in response to cold or stress, which is not described here. Pseudogout involves joint pain and swelling, usually in the knee, and is not related to the symptoms described. Cellulitis would present with localized skin redness, warmth, and swelling, which is not indicated in the question.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is critical limb ischemia.",9
6121,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of chronic hepatitis C infection, including jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, and positive hepatitis C antibody. The presence of blisters and erosions on the dorsum of the hands suggests porphyria cutanea tarda, which is associated with hepatitis C. The next step in diagnosis is to confirm active hepatitis C infection by detecting the presence of the virus. This is done by performing a PCR for viral RNA, which will confirm active viral replication and infection.",9
6126,"The patient is a young male recruit with foot pain that worsens with activity and improves with rest, and tenderness over the second metatarsal. These symptoms are suggestive of a stress fracture, which is common in military recruits due to increased physical activity. The radiograph shows no abnormalities, which is typical early in stress fractures as they may not be visible on X-rays initially. The best initial management for a suspected stress fracture, especially when X-rays are negative, is conservative treatment with rest and NSAIDs like ibuprofen to manage pain and inflammation. More advanced imaging like MRI is not immediately necessary unless symptoms persist despite conservative management.",9
6134,"The patient is a young man with severe pain in multiple areas, including arms, legs, chest, and back, and has a history of similar episodes. The laboratory findings show anemia (hemoglobin 10 g/dL, hematocrit 30%) and elevated LDH (327 U/L), which can be indicative of hemolysis. The normal leukocyte count and platelet count, along with the absence of significant electrolyte imbalances, suggest that there is no acute infection or major organ failure. The symptoms and lab findings are consistent with sickle cell disease, where microvascular occlusion due to sickled red blood cells leads to vaso-occlusive crises, causing severe pain. This is supported by the recurrent nature of the episodes and the patient's occupation, which may involve physical exertion, potentially triggering such crises. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is microvascular occlusion due to sickle cell disease.",9
6137,"The patient is in severe pain following a fall and has a history of opioid use disorder, currently managed with methadone. In this scenario, the patient's acute pain needs to be addressed appropriately. Given his history of opioid use disorder, it's important to manage his pain effectively while considering his current methadone treatment. Methadone maintenance therapy should be continued, and additional pain management should be provided. Short-acting opioids can be used to manage acute pain in patients on methadone, as they are already tolerant to opioids. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to provide scheduled short-acting opioids to manage his acute pain, while continuing his methadone.",9
6138,"Short-acting beta2-agonists, such as albuterol, work by binding to beta2-adrenergic receptors on bronchial smooth muscle cells. These receptors are Gs protein-coupled receptors. Upon activation, the Gs protein stimulates adenylyl cyclase, which converts ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP). The increase in intracellular cAMP leads to relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and bronchodilation, alleviating symptoms of asthma such as wheezing and shortness of breath.",10
6145,"The patient presents with rapidly progressing dementia, memory lapses, difficulties with daily activities, and getting lost, which are indicative of cognitive decline. The key feature here is the diffuse involuntary muscle jerking provoked by loud noises, which suggests myoclonus. This combination of rapidly progressive dementia and myoclonus is characteristic of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Alzheimer's disease typically progresses more slowly and does not usually present with myoclonus. Huntington's disease involves chorea and psychiatric symptoms, and it usually has a genetic component with a family history. Normal pressure hydrocephalus presents with the triad of gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and dementia, but not myoclonus. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.",9
6146,"The patient presents with blisters on the hands and hyperpigmented scars, which are suggestive of a photosensitive skin condition. Given his occupation and symptoms, porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is a likely diagnosis. PCT is associated with blistering skin lesions on sun-exposed areas, often due to uroporphyrin accumulation. Checking the urine uroporphyrin level would help confirm this diagnosis.",9
6148,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs consistent with lobar pneumonia, including fever, productive cough, and physical exam findings of dullness to percussion, bronchial breath sounds, and egophony. The chest X-ray shows an alveolar pattern in the upper right lobe, which is typical for lobar pneumonia. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of community-acquired lobar pneumonia, especially in adults. The patient's smoking history and acute presentation further support this common etiology.",9
6151,"The patient presents with a dilated pupil, ptosis, and the eye positioned inferolaterally, which are classic signs of oculomotor nerve (CN III) palsy. The oculomotor nerve innervates most of the extraocular muscles, the levator palpebrae superioris (which elevates the eyelid), and carries parasympathetic fibers to the pupil for constriction. Compression of the oculomotor nerve by a berry aneurysm can lead to dysfunction of these fibers. The parasympathetic fibers are located on the periphery of the nerve and are often affected first by compression, leading to pupil dilation (mydriasis) due to unopposed sympathetic activity. The eye being positioned inferolaterally is due to the unopposed action of the lateral rectus (innervated by CN VI) and superior oblique (innervated by CN IV) muscles. Therefore, the unopposed superior oblique muscle, which is responsible for intorsion and depression of the eye, rotates the eye downward and laterally.",9
6154,"The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are key to diagnosing her condition. She has shoulder pain that worsens with overhead activities, which is a common presentation for rotator cuff issues. The tenderness over the lateral shoulder and pain with active abduction above 90 degrees suggest involvement of the rotator cuff, particularly the supraspinatus tendon. The pain with passive internal rotation and lifting the shoulder (Hawkins-Kennedy test) also supports this. Full range of motion and normal strength make adhesive capsulitis and glenohumeral osteoarthritis less likely. Biceps tendinopathy typically presents with pain in the anterior shoulder and pain with resisted elbow flexion, which this patient does not have. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is rotator cuff tendinopathy.",9
6156,"The hormone measured in the urine pregnancy test is human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). hCG is produced by the placenta shortly after implantation. Its primary role early in pregnancy is to maintain the corpus luteum, which in turn secretes progesterone to sustain the uterine lining and support the early stages of pregnancy. This is crucial until the placenta is developed enough to produce adequate levels of progesterone on its own. Therefore, the process directly associated with hCG is the maintenance of the corpus luteum.",9
6159,"The patient has a BMI of 30, indicating obesity, and her lab results show elevated fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels, consistent with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Her triglycerides and HDL levels also suggest dyslipidemia. The first-line pharmacotherapy for type 2 diabetes, especially in overweight or obese patients, is Metformin. Metformin helps improve insulin sensitivity and can aid in weight management. While dietary modification is important, pharmacotherapy is necessary given her high HbA1c level. Glipizide and Sitagliptin are other options for diabetes management, but Metformin is preferred as the initial treatment due to its efficacy, safety profile, and potential weight benefits.",9
6157,"The patient's symptoms suggest a neurological issue affecting the lower extremities and perineum. The key findings include absent pinprick sensation in the perineum and right lower limb, significant weakness in the right lower extremity, and absent reflexes on the right side. These symptoms are indicative of a lower motor neuron lesion affecting the nerve roots, which is characteristic of cauda equina syndrome. Cauda equina syndrome results from compression of the nerve roots in the lumbar region, leading to sensory deficits, motor weakness, and reflex changes. The absence of perineal sensation (saddle anesthesia) is particularly suggestive of this condition. Therefore, an MRI of the lumbar spine would most likely show compression of the cauda equina.",9
6181,"Chemotherapeutic agents typically target rapidly dividing cells, which is why tissues with high turnover rates, such as the gastrointestinal tract (enterocytes) and hair follicles, are particularly susceptible to these drugs. Cardiac myocytes and liver hepatocytes, on the other hand, are more resistant to chemotherapy because they are not rapidly dividing. Cardiac myocytes are terminally differentiated cells with very limited regenerative capacity, making them highly resistant to the effects of chemotherapy. Liver hepatocytes have some regenerative ability but are not as rapidly dividing as enterocytes or hair follicle cells. Therefore, cardiac myocytes would be the most resistant to chemotherapeutic agents among the options given.",9
6188,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest hereditary spherocytosis. The child has jaundice, anemia, and splenomegaly, which are common in hemolytic anemias. The family history of splenectomy in the father suggests a hereditary condition. The laboratory findings show normocytic anemia with increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and increased red cell distribution width (RDW), which are characteristic of hereditary spherocytosis. This condition is caused by defects in proteins of the red blood cell membrane, such as spectrin, ankyrin, or band 3, leading to decreased membrane stability and spherocyte formation. The increased MCHC and RDW, along with the clinical history, point towards decreased spectrin in the RBC membrane as the pathophysiology.",9
6189,"The 18-month-old boy presents with signs and symptoms consistent with rickets, a condition often caused by vitamin D deficiency. Key findings include delayed walking, frontal bossing, widened wrists, bent legs, and beading of the ribs (rachitic rosary). These are indicative of defective mineralization of the growth plates, which is characteristic of rickets. The history of exclusive breastfeeding without vitamin D supplementation and the presence of dental issues further support this diagnosis. The underlying cause of the delay in walking is related to the defective mineralization of the growth plates due to vitamin D deficiency, leading to soft and weak bones.",9
6184,"The patient's symptoms include a long-standing pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to negative evaluation. She avoids social interactions due to fear of criticism and rejection, which is characteristic of Avoidant Personality Disorder. Schizoid Personality Disorder is characterized by a lack of desire for social relationships and a limited range of emotional expression, which does not fit this patient's concern about being unappealing and desire for acceptance. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood involves a reaction to a specific stressor, which is not indicated here. Dependent Personality Disorder involves a pervasive need to be taken care of and fear of separation, which is not the primary issue in this case. Therefore, the most fitting diagnosis is Avoidant Personality Disorder.",9
6183,"The clinical presentation of a 3-week-old boy with non-bilious projectile vomiting, dehydration, and a palpable ""olive-like"" mass in the right upper quadrant is classic for hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. The metabolic findings of hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis are also consistent with this condition, as the vomiting leads to loss of gastric acid (hydrochloric acid), resulting in alkalosis and electrolyte imbalances. The palpable mass is due to the hypertrophied pylorus muscle. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is hypertrophy of the pylorus muscle.",10
6190,"The patient has alcoholic liver cirrhosis with large ascites and signs of hepatic encephalopathy (e.g., asterixis and decreased attention span). Despite abstaining from alcohol and following a low-sodium diet, he has progressive abdominal distention, indicating refractory ascites. His current medications include spironolactone and furosemide, which are standard treatments for ascites, but they seem insufficient. The presence of shifting dullness confirms significant ascites. Given the tense ascites and the need for symptom relief, large-volume paracentesis is the most appropriate immediate step to alleviate discomfort and reduce ascites. Other options like TIPS or liver transplantation are considered for long-term management but are not immediate interventions for symptomatic relief.",9
6191,"The patient presents with right flank pain, hematuria, and a significant smoking history. The elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit suggest possible erythrocytosis, which can be associated with paraneoplastic syndromes. The absence of fever, chills, and dysuria makes an infectious cause like pyelonephritis less likely. Polycystic kidney disease typically presents with hypertension and renal failure, not erythrocytosis. Renal oncocytoma is a benign tumor and less likely to cause these symptoms. Renal cell carcinoma is known for causing hematuria, flank pain, and paraneoplastic syndromes such as erythrocytosis due to ectopic erythropoietin production. Given the smoking history and clinical presentation, renal cell carcinoma is the most likely diagnosis.",9
6192,"The clinical presentation of the woman and her children suggests a mitochondrial disorder. The symptoms of seizures, muscle weakness, and lactic acidosis, along with the biopsy showing ragged red fibers, are characteristic of mitochondrial myopathy. Mitochondrial disorders are maternally inherited because mitochondria are passed from mother to offspring through the egg. The presence of symptoms in both the daughter and son supports this inheritance pattern. In mitochondrial disorders, heteroplasmy is common, meaning there is a mixture of normal and mutated mitochondrial DNA within cells. This heterogeneity can lead to variable expression of symptoms among family members. Therefore, the genetic analysis of the patient's son is most likely to show heterogenous mitochondrial DNA.",9
6196,"The patient presents with pancytopenia (anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia) and a low reticulocyte count, indicating reduced bone marrow activity. The bone marrow aspirate shows hypocellularity, which is consistent with aplastic anemia. Aplastic anemia is characterized by bone marrow failure leading to decreased production of all blood cell lines. The normochromic, normocytic anemia and the presence of petechiae due to thrombocytopenia further support this diagnosis. Multiple myeloma is unlikely in a child and typically presents with hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, and bone lesions. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura usually presents with isolated thrombocytopenia without anemia or leukopenia. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia would typically show hypercellular marrow with blasts, not hypocellularity.",9
6207,"The patient is presenting with a fever after recent chemotherapy for AML, which is a classic scenario for febrile neutropenia. Her leukocyte count is 800/mm3 with 40% segmented neutrophils, indicating an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 320/mm3, confirming neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm3). In febrile neutropenia, broad-spectrum antibiotics are initiated to cover potential bacterial infections, as these patients are at high risk for serious infections due to their immunocompromised state. Imipenem is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, making it the most appropriate choice for initial empiric therapy in this setting. Caspofungin is an antifungal, ciprofloxacin is not broad enough for initial empiric therapy in febrile neutropenia, and valacyclovir is an antiviral, none of which are appropriate as first-line treatment for febrile neutropenia.",9
6206,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of microcytic anemia (low hemoglobin and low mean corpuscular volume). The symptoms of pale conjunctivae, inflammation of the corners of the mouth, and brittle nails are consistent with iron deficiency anemia. Given her history of regular menstrual periods and the family history of Hashimoto thyroiditis, it is important to evaluate for iron deficiency, which is the most common cause of microcytic anemia in this demographic. The most appropriate next step to confirm iron deficiency anemia is to check ferritin levels, as ferritin is a marker of iron stores in the body.",9
6199,"The patient's presentation is consistent with a posterior hip dislocation, which is common in motor vehicle accidents where the knee hits the dashboard. The classic position of the leg in a posterior dislocation is adduction, flexion, and internal rotation. In a posterior dislocation, the femoral head is displaced posteriorly and appears smaller on the radiograph due to its position relative to the acetabulum. Therefore, the radiograph would show the femoral head smaller than the contralateral side and posterior to the acetabulum.",9
6208,"The patient has a history of myocardial infarction, as indicated by the Q waves in the inferior leads on the ECG. During the exercise tolerance test, he develops chest pain and a drop in blood pressure, which are concerning for ischemia despite the absence of ECG changes. The drop in blood pressure during exercise suggests that the heart is not able to maintain adequate perfusion, which is a sign of significant coronary artery disease. In this context, continuing the exercise test could be dangerous, and repeating the test later would not address the current issue. A pharmacological stress test might not provide additional useful information given the current symptoms and hemodynamic changes. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to stop the exercise and order a coronary angiography to directly visualize the coronary arteries and assess for significant blockages.",9
6213,"The patient is presenting with signs of acute renal transplant rejection, as indicated by decreased urine output, elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, and biopsy findings of lymphocyte infiltration and intimal swelling. These findings are consistent with acute cellular rejection. The appropriate management for acute cellular rejection is to start high-dose intravenous steroids to suppress the immune response and prevent further damage to the transplanted kidney. Adding ceftriaxone would be for treating an infection, which is not indicated here. Adding diltiazem would help control blood pressure but does not address the rejection. Nephrectomy is not indicated unless the graft is non-functional and causing harm.",9
6214,"The patient's symptoms of severe truncal ataxia, horizontal gaze palsy, and impaired vestibulo-ocular reflexes are indicative of Wernicke's encephalopathy, which is caused by thiamine (Vitamin B1) deficiency. This condition is commonly seen in alcoholics or malnourished individuals, such as a homeless person. Delirium tremens (A) is characterized by autonomic instability and hallucinations, not the specific neurological signs seen here. Miller-Fisher syndrome (B) involves ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia, but the patient has normal reflexes. Ethylene glycol intoxication (D) typically presents with metabolic acidosis and renal failure, not the neurological signs described.",9
6229,"The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus with an elevated hemoglobin A1c of 8.5%, indicating poor glycemic control. She is already on metformin and glipizide, but her symptoms of increased thirst and urinary frequency persist. The new medication prescribed is known to cause weight loss and increase the risk of urinary tract infections and vulvovaginal candidiasis. These side effects are characteristic of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. SGLT2 inhibitors work by blocking the reabsorption of glucose in the proximal tubule of the kidney, leading to increased glucose excretion in the urine. This mechanism can lead to weight loss and an increased risk of genitourinary infections due to the presence of glucose in the urine, which provides a substrate for bacterial and fungal growth.",9
6225,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with urticaria (hives), which is characterized by itchy, raised, erythematous plaques. These symptoms developed after taking an antibiotic, suggesting an allergic reaction. Urticaria is commonly caused by the release of histamine, a vasoactive amine, from mast cells and basophils in response to an allergen. This release leads to increased vascular permeability and the characteristic swelling and redness. The other options are less likely: C1 inhibitor deficiency is associated with hereditary angioedema, complement activation is more related to immune complex diseases, and immune complex deposition typically causes conditions like serum sickness or vasculitis, not urticaria.",9
6231,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are suggestive of mitral stenosis. The irregularly irregular pulse indicates atrial fibrillation, which is commonly associated with mitral stenosis. The rumbling mid-diastolic murmur heard at the apex in the left lateral decubitus position is characteristic of mitral stenosis. The most common underlying cause of mitral stenosis is rheumatic heart disease, which results from antibody cross-reactivity following a streptococcal infection. This cross-reactivity leads to inflammation and scarring of the mitral valve, causing stenosis.",9
6237,"The key points in this case are the patient's age, growth pattern, and bone age. The patient is 14 years old but has a bone age of 11 years, indicating a delay in skeletal maturation. His height is below the third percentile, but his weight is at the 50th percentile, suggesting that his growth in height is more affected than his weight. The unremarkable laboratory workup, including TSH, rules out thyroid issues. 

Constitutional growth delay is characterized by a temporary delay in skeletal growth and puberty, resulting in a child being shorter than average for their age but eventually reaching a normal adult height. This condition often presents with delayed bone age, which matches the findings in this case.

Familial short stature would typically show a normal bone age and a consistent growth pattern along a lower percentile, without the delay in growth spurt.

Celiac disease could cause growth issues, but it would likely present with other symptoms such as gastrointestinal complaints or weight issues.

Growth hormone deficiency could also cause short stature, but it would likely present with a more significant discrepancy between height and weight and other clinical signs.

Given the delayed bone age and the pattern of growth, the most likely diagnosis is constitutional growth delay.",9
6244,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of heart failure, including shortness of breath, jugular venous distension, bilateral ankle edema, and crackles in the lungs. The presence of an S3 gallop and cardiac silhouette enlargement on chest x-ray further supports this. The erythematous, ring-shaped macules and patches on the trunk are consistent with erythema marginatum, a rash associated with acute rheumatic fever. The history of a sore throat 3 weeks ago that resolved without treatment suggests a preceding streptococcal infection, which is a common precursor to acute rheumatic fever. The fever, malaise, and elevated leukocyte count are consistent with an inflammatory process. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest acute rheumatic fever as the etiology of the patient's symptoms.",9
6253,"The patient is a 25-year-old primigravida at 35 weeks gestation presenting with severe headache, hypertension (150/100 mm Hg), and generalized hyperreflexia. She also has bilateral crackles on lung auscultation, indicating possible pulmonary edema, and moderate pitting edema. Her laboratory findings show significant proteinuria (spot urine protein 360 mg/dL) and normal platelet count, liver enzymes, and renal function. 

The key features here are the severe headache, hypertension, proteinuria, and hyperreflexia, which are indicative of preeclampsia with severe features. Eclampsia would involve seizures, which are not present in this case. HELLP syndrome would typically show hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets, which are not seen here. Gestational hypertension would not involve proteinuria or severe symptoms like headache and hyperreflexia.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is preeclampsia with severe features.",9
6256,"The patient presents with polyuria, nocturia, polydipsia, and weakness, which are suggestive of diabetes insipidus (DI). His use of lithium, a common cause of nephrogenic DI, supports this suspicion. The laboratory findings show hypernatremia (high serum osmolality) and low urine osmolality, consistent with DI. To differentiate between central and nephrogenic DI, the water deprivation test is the best initial diagnostic test. This test assesses the kidney's ability to concentrate urine in response to dehydration and can help determine if the DI is due to a lack of ADH (central DI) or a lack of response to ADH (nephrogenic DI).",9
6257,"The patient is pregnant and planning to travel to Mozambique, a region where malaria is endemic. Malaria prophylaxis is important for pregnant women traveling to such areas due to the increased risk of severe malaria and its complications during pregnancy. Doxycycline is contraindicated in pregnancy due to potential effects on fetal bone and teeth development. Primaquine is not used for prophylaxis and is contraindicated in pregnancy due to the risk of hemolytic anemia in G6PD-deficient individuals. Proguanil is not typically used alone for prophylaxis and is often combined with atovaquone, which is not mentioned here. Mefloquine is considered safe for use in pregnancy and is commonly recommended for malaria prophylaxis in pregnant women traveling to endemic areas. Therefore, the most suitable drug for this patient is Mefloquine.",9
6260,"The patient presents with symptoms of hemoptysis, hematuria, and renal impairment, which are suggestive of a pulmonary-renal syndrome. The laboratory findings show elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, indicating renal dysfunction, along with proteinuria, hematuria, and numerous RBC casts, which are indicative of glomerulonephritis. The chest X-ray shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, consistent with pulmonary hemorrhage. The key finding from the renal biopsy is the linear deposits of IgG along the glomerular basement membrane. This is characteristic of Goodpasture syndrome, which involves anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies causing both pulmonary and renal symptoms. The other options, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis, typically show pauci-immune glomerulonephritis without linear IgG deposits. Reactivated tuberculosis would not present with these renal findings.",9
6265,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism: fatigue, weight gain, heavy menstrual bleeding, bradycardia, and delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes. The puffy face, thinning of the eyebrows, and telangiectasias are also consistent with hypothyroidism. In hypothyroidism, the thyroid gland is underactive, leading to low levels of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4), which results in elevated TSH due to lack of negative feedback on the pituitary gland. The other options do not fit the clinical picture as well as hypothyroidism does. Elevated midnight cortisol would suggest Cushing's syndrome, which does not match the symptoms. An elevated LH:FSH ratio is associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which typically presents with irregular periods and signs of hyperandrogenism. Elevated androgens would also suggest PCOS or an adrenal disorder, neither of which align with the patient's presentation.",9
6259,"The patient presents with a pruritic rash after returning from a hiking trip in North Carolina. Given the context, this is likely contact dermatitis, possibly due to exposure to plants like poison ivy, which is common in such areas. The rash is pruritic and localized to the arms, which supports this diagnosis. The most appropriate management for contact dermatitis is symptomatic relief. Topical calamine lotion is commonly used to relieve itching and irritation associated with contact dermatitis. There is no indication for ivermectin, as this is not a parasitic infection. Counseling on alcohol intake is not relevant to the acute management of the rash. Oral prednisone is typically reserved for more severe or widespread cases of contact dermatitis.",9
6264,"The patient presents with hypertension that is difficult to control, fatigue, nocturia, and paresthesia in the legs. The lab findings show hypokalemia (low potassium), metabolic alkalosis (high bicarbonate), and low plasma renin activity. These findings are suggestive of a condition that causes hypertension with low renin and low potassium levels. Primary aldosteronism (Conn's syndrome) is characterized by excessive production of aldosterone, leading to sodium retention, potassium excretion, and metabolic alkalosis. The low plasma renin activity is due to negative feedback from the high blood pressure and sodium retention. The combination of hypertension, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and low renin activity is classic for primary aldosteronism.",9
6267,"The clinical presentation suggests familial hypercholesterolemia, characterized by high LDL levels, xanthelasma (yellow patches on eyelids), and xanthomas (yellow bumps on ankles). The family history of early myocardial infarctions and high cholesterol despite statin use further supports this diagnosis. Familial hypercholesterolemia is most commonly caused by a defect in the LDL receptor, which leads to decreased clearance of LDL from the bloodstream, resulting in elevated LDL levels. Therefore, the defective protein in this patient is most likely the LDL receptor.",10
6272,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of croup (laryngotracheobronchitis), which is common in young children and characterized by a barking cough, stridor, and respiratory distress. The presence of inspiratory stridor, retractions, and a history of upper respiratory symptoms supports this diagnosis. The fever and gradual worsening of symptoms also align with croup rather than foreign body aspiration, which would typically present more acutely. In croup, nebulized epinephrine is used to reduce airway swelling and improve breathing. Albuterol is not effective for croup as it targets lower airway issues like asthma. Noninvasive ventilation is not the first-line treatment for croup. Reassurance alone is not appropriate given the severity of symptoms. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is nebulized epinephrine.",9
6278,"The patient presents with palpitations, irregular pulse, fine tremor, warm extremities, and swollen lower legs. These symptoms are suggestive of hyperthyroidism, which can cause atrial fibrillation (irregular pulse) and other symptoms like tremor and warm extremities. The swollen lower legs could be due to pretibial myxedema, associated with Graves' disease. Given these findings, measuring TSH levels is the most appropriate next step to evaluate for hyperthyroidism.",9
6279,"Repaglinide is a meglitinide, which works by stimulating insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells. This mechanism is similar to that of sulfonylureas, such as glyburide, which also stimulate insulin secretion by closing ATP-sensitive potassium channels on the beta-cell membrane, leading to depolarization and insulin release. Linagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione, and miglitol is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, all of which have different mechanisms of action.",10
6281,"The patient presents with hypertension, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and decreased aldosterone levels. These findings suggest a condition that mimics hyperaldosteronism but with low aldosterone, known as Liddle syndrome. Liddle syndrome is caused by an autosomal dominant gain of function mutation in the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the distal nephron, leading to increased sodium reabsorption, hypertension, and hypokalemia. The treatment for Liddle syndrome involves blocking the ENaC channels to reduce sodium reabsorption and correct the electrolyte imbalance. Amiloride is a potassium-sparing diuretic that specifically blocks ENaC channels, making it the appropriate treatment for this condition.",9
6280,"The patient presents with abdominal pain, a positive pregnancy test, and a beta-hCG level of 1,110 mIU/mL, but no intrauterine pregnancy is seen on transvaginal ultrasound. This raises suspicion for an ectopic pregnancy, especially given the abdominal pain and the beta-hCG level, which is above the discriminatory zone (usually around 1,500-2,000 mIU/mL) where an intrauterine pregnancy should be visible on ultrasound. However, the absence of free fluid suggests there is no rupture yet. The patient wishes to preserve fertility, which makes conservative management preferable if possible. Repeating the beta-hCG in 2 days can help determine if the pregnancy is ectopic by assessing the rise or fall of hCG levels. A rise that is less than expected for a normal intrauterine pregnancy would support the diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy. Therefore, the best next step is to repeat the beta-hCG in 2 days to further evaluate the situation before proceeding with surgical options.",9
6238,,0
6284,"The patient has a history of cirrhosis and presents with signs of portal hypertension, such as ascites and varices. The anoscopy reveals enlarged bluish vessels above the dentate line, which are indicative of internal hemorrhoids. In the context of portal hypertension, these are likely due to engorgement of the superior rectal vein, which drains into the portal venous system via the inferior mesenteric vein. The inferior rectal vein drains into the systemic circulation and is associated with external hemorrhoids, which are below the dentate line. Therefore, the most likely source of bleeding in this patient is the superior rectal vein.",9
6286,"The infant has tricuspid atresia, which is characterized by the absence of the tricuspid valve, leading to a lack of direct blood flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle. This condition results in a right-to-left shunt, often through an atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale, and requires a patent ductus arteriosus or ventricular septal defect for pulmonary blood flow. The pulmonary outflow tract obstruction and the need for a patent ductus arteriosus suggest that the infant will have reduced pulmonary blood flow, leading to cyanosis. Cyanosis, or bluish discoloration of the lips, is a direct result of the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood and is typically the earliest sign in such congenital heart defects. Other signs like clubbing develop over a longer period, and hepatomegaly or diaphoresis while feeding may occur later as the heart failure progresses.",9
6291,"The clinical presentation of the 3-week-old infant with projectile vomiting, non-bilious vomitus, dehydration signs (dry mucous membranes, delayed capillary refill), and a palpable olive-shaped epigastric mass is highly suggestive of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. This condition is characterized by hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter muscle, specifically the muscularis externa, leading to gastric outlet obstruction. The non-bilious nature of the vomitus indicates that the obstruction is proximal to the duodenum, which aligns with pyloric stenosis. The palpable olive-shaped mass is a classic finding in this condition. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is hypertrophic muscularis externa.",9
6296,"The swelling described is located at the right posterior vaginal introitus and is fluctuant, suggesting a cystic nature. The greater vestibular glands, also known as Bartholin's glands, are located at the posterior part of the vaginal introitus. These glands can become blocked and form cysts or abscesses, which would present as a fluctuant swelling in this area. The paraurethral glands (Skene's glands) are located near the urethra, not the posterior introitus. Mesonephric duct remnants and sebaceous glands are not typically associated with this presentation. Therefore, the swelling is most likely derived from the greater vestibular glands.",9
6305,"The relative risk (RR) of 2.3 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.05-3.50 indicates that the interval does not include 1. This suggests that the result is statistically significant at the 0.05 level. A p-value less than 0.05 would correspond to this finding, as it indicates that the observed association is unlikely to be due to chance. Among the options provided, a p-value of 0.04 is the only one less than 0.05, indicating statistical significance.",9
6315,"The patient's serology shows HBsAg positive, indicating an active infection. The presence of anti-HBcAg IgG and absence of anti-HBcAg IgM suggest a chronic infection rather than an acute one. The negative HBeAg and positive anti-HBeAg antibody indicate low viral replication and low infectivity. Therefore, the patient is chronically infected with low infectivity.",10
6314,"The patient presents with primary amenorrhea, normal secondary sexual characteristics, and absence of a uterus with normal ovaries. These findings suggest a condition where the paramesonephric (Müllerian) ducts fail to develop, leading to the absence of the uterus and upper two-thirds of the vagina. The presence of normal ovaries and secondary sexual characteristics indicates normal ovarian function and estrogen production, ruling out options related to ovarian failure or estrogen deficiency. The genotype 47 XXY is associated with Klinefelter syndrome, which affects males and is not relevant here. The failure of the mesonephric duct to degenerate would not explain the absence of the uterus. Therefore, the most likely pathophysiology is the failure of the paramesonephric duct to form, consistent with Müllerian agenesis (Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome).",9
6318,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a corneal ulcer, likely due to a bacterial infection, given the presence of a round corneal infiltrate and the use of contact lenses. Contact lens wearers are at increased risk for bacterial keratitis, commonly caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or other bacteria. The presence of a whitish exudate in the anterior chamber (hypopyon) further supports a bacterial etiology. The most appropriate treatment for bacterial keratitis is a topical antibiotic. Of the options provided, topical ofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, is the most appropriate choice for treating bacterial keratitis.",9
6322,"70% ethanol is an effective disinfectant against enveloped viruses due to its ability to disrupt lipid membranes. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is an enveloped virus, meaning it has a lipid membrane that can be disrupted by ethanol, making it susceptible to this type of disinfection. In contrast, non-enveloped viruses like Hepatitis A virus, Parvovirus, and Polyomavirus are more resistant to ethanol because they lack a lipid envelope. Therefore, disinfecting surfaces with 70% ethanol is most effective against enveloped viruses such as HSV.",10
6325,"The patient presents with signs of respiratory distress and decreased breath sounds over the left lung base, along with a sudden increase in plateau airway pressure. The arterial blood gas analysis shows respiratory alkalosis with hypoxemia. The chest x-ray finding of deepening of the costophrenic angle on the left side suggests a pneumothorax, likely a tension pneumothorax given the acute respiratory changes and increased airway pressures. In this scenario, the most appropriate next step is to relieve the pressure by inserting a chest tube to allow re-expansion of the lung and improve ventilation.",9
6323,"The patient presents with signs of opioid overdose, which include decreased respiratory rate (respiratory depression), pinpoint pupils, and altered mental status. The slow, shallow breathing leads to hypoventilation, causing carbon dioxide retention (hypercapnia) and respiratory acidosis. In respiratory acidosis, the primary disturbance is increased carbon dioxide (CO2) due to hypoventilation. Over time, if the condition persists, the kidneys may compensate by retaining bicarbonate (HCO3-) to buffer the acidosis, but this compensation takes time. In the acute setting, we would expect to see increased CO2 with normal or slightly increased bicarbonate, but since the question asks for the most likely findings, the acute increase in CO2 is the key feature. Therefore, the most likely findings in this acute scenario are decreased bicarbonate (due to lack of compensation) and increased carbon dioxide due to respiratory acidosis.",9
6327,"The patient presents with hypotension, tachycardia, and a history of trauma from a motor vehicle collision. The key finding from the cardiac catheterization is the equilibration of diastolic pressures across all cardiac chambers, which is characteristic of cardiac tamponade. In tamponade, fluid accumulation in the pericardial space leads to increased pressure that affects all chambers equally during diastole, preventing proper filling. This results in the Beck's triad of hypotension, muffled heart sounds, and jugular venous distension, although not all components are always clinically evident. The other options do not typically present with equalization of diastolic pressures: congestive heart failure involves volume overload and pressure differences, septic shock involves systemic vasodilation and hypotension without chamber pressure equalization, and tension pneumothorax involves respiratory distress and mediastinal shift, not equalization of cardiac chamber pressures.",9
6330,"The patient presents with swelling and pain in the right leg, along with fever, following recent surgery. These symptoms are suggestive of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), especially given the recent surgery and cancer diagnosis, both of which are risk factors for thromboembolism. Compression ultrasonography is the most appropriate and non-invasive test to confirm the presence of a DVT in the leg. Other options like CT pulmonary angiography are used for pulmonary embolism, and blood cultures are for infections, which are less likely given the presentation. Transthoracic echocardiography is not relevant for diagnosing DVT.",9
6332,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of epididymitis, which is inflammation of the epididymis. The positive Prehn sign (relief of pain with scrotal elevation) and increased blood flow on Doppler sonography support this diagnosis, as opposed to testicular torsion, which would show decreased blood flow. In a sexually active young man, epididymitis is often caused by sexually transmitted infections, such as Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The appropriate treatment for epididymitis in this demographic is a combination of antibiotics targeting these organisms. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to administer antibiotics that cover these likely pathogens.",9
6339,"The patient's symptoms and genetic findings are indicative of Huntington's disease, which is caused by a mutation on chromosome 4. The condition is characterized by chorea (involuntary jerky movements), cognitive decline, and psychiatric symptoms. In Huntington's disease, there is degeneration of the striatum, particularly affecting the GABAergic neurons. This leads to decreased levels of GABA and acetylcholine, and increased levels of dopamine in the brain. The increased dopamine activity is associated with the movement disorders seen in Huntington's disease.",9
6340,"The patient presents with arthritis, leg swelling, and a tan complexion, which are suggestive of hemochromatosis. Hemochromatosis is a condition characterized by excessive iron deposition in the body, leading to symptoms such as arthritis, diabetes (""bronze diabetes""), skin pigmentation, and heart problems. The arthritis and skin changes, along with diabetes, fit the classic presentation of hemochromatosis. In hemochromatosis, liver involvement can lead to hepatocellular carcinoma, which is associated with elevated levels of alpha fetoprotein (AFP). Therefore, the tumor marker most likely associated with this patient's condition is alpha fetoprotein.",9
6334,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a deficiency in niacin (vitamin B3), leading to pellagra, which is characterized by the ""3 D's"": dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia. The skin lesions on sun-exposed areas, chronic diarrhea, and cognitive changes align with this diagnosis. The patient's vegan diet, which lacks niacin-rich foods, and his history of gastroenterostomy, which can impair nutrient absorption, further support this. Niacin is a precursor for NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), so a deficiency in niacin would lead to impaired production of NAD+.",9
6341,"The patient has cystic fibrosis, which is associated with chronic lung infections due to thick mucus secretions that trap bacteria. In CF patients, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common pathogen responsible for recurrent respiratory infections. The symptoms of recurrent cough, foul-smelling sputum, and history of pneumonia align with chronic Pseudomonas infection. Other options like Histoplasmosis and Mycobacterium avium are less common in CF, and Pneumococcus typically causes acute pneumonia rather than chronic symptoms.",9
6346,"The patient is at 39 weeks' gestation and has been exposed to varicella zoster virus (VZV) through her nephew. She has no immunity to VZV, as indicated by negative IgG titers, and she is not vaccinated. In pregnant women who are non-immune and have been exposed to VZV, the appropriate management is to administer varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) to reduce the risk of maternal infection and potential complications. The varicella vaccine is contraindicated during pregnancy, and ganciclovir is not used for VZV prophylaxis. Reassurance alone is not sufficient given the exposure and lack of immunity.",9
6347,"The clinical presentation of the child is suggestive of Kawasaki disease, characterized by prolonged fever, rash, conjunctivitis, and extremity changes such as swelling. The elevated ESR supports an inflammatory process. The next best step in management for Kawasaki disease is high-dose aspirin, which helps reduce inflammation and prevent coronary artery aneurysms. Low-dose aspirin is used later for its antiplatelet effects, but initially, high-dose aspirin is required.",9
6350,"The patient has asthma and is on inhaled albuterol and beclomethasone, but continues to have symptoms, particularly a cough at night and occasional substernal chest pain. These symptoms, along with hoarseness and frequent throat clearing, suggest gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which can exacerbate asthma symptoms. Her BMI of 30 kg/m2 also increases the likelihood of GERD. Adding a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) can help manage GERD, potentially improving her asthma symptoms. Other options like adding salmeterol or oral prednisone are more directly related to asthma control, but the presence of GERD symptoms makes a PPI a more appropriate next step.",9
6351,"The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are suggestive of osteoarthritis. The significant back and hip pain that worsens throughout the day is characteristic of osteoarthritis, which typically presents with joint pain that worsens with activity and improves with rest. The bony enlargement of the distal interphalangeal joints, known as Heberden's nodes, is a classic sign of osteoarthritis. Gout and pseudogout usually present with acute joint inflammation and are not associated with bony enlargement of the distal interphalangeal joints. Osteopaenia refers to decreased bone density and does not typically cause joint pain or bony enlargement.",9
6353,"The patient's symptoms and findings are suggestive of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES), which is characterized by gastrin-secreting tumors (gastrinomas) leading to excessive gastric acid production. The presence of multiple ulcers in the duodenum and jejunum, thick gastric folds, and a very low gastric pH all support this diagnosis. The key test to confirm ZES is measuring the fasting serum gastrin level, as it will be elevated due to the gastrin-secreting tumor.",9
6360,"The key features in this scenario are the woman's poor self-image, extreme sensitivity to criticism, social inhibition, and desire for relationships despite not having any. These characteristics align with avoidant personality disorder, which involves feelings of inadequacy, hypersensitivity to negative evaluation, and avoidance of social interaction despite a desire for closeness. Paranoid personality disorder is characterized by distrust and suspicion, which is not indicated here. Depression and dysthymia involve mood disturbances, but the primary issue here is related to personality traits and social inhibition rather than mood.",9
6361,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of an eating disorder, likely anorexia nervosa, given her emaciation, amenorrhea, and bradycardia. In patients with eating disorders, especially anorexia nervosa, bupropion is contraindicated due to the increased risk of seizures. Bupropion lowers the seizure threshold, and patients with eating disorders are already at a higher risk for seizures due to electrolyte imbalances and malnutrition. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, SSRIs, and olanzapine are not contraindicated and can be part of the treatment plan for eating disorders.",9
6374,"The patient presents with an inability to recall personal information, including his identity and past, after being found in a location away from home. He has traveled from Chicago to St. Louis and cannot remember why he is there. This suggests a sudden, unexpected travel away from home with an inability to recall one's past, which is characteristic of dissociative fugue. The negative urine toxicology screen and normal physical examination rule out substance-induced causes. The fact that he is a soldier recently returned from deployment may suggest stress or trauma-related factors, which can be associated with dissociative disorders. Other options like bipolar disorder, depersonalization disorder, and dissociative identity disorder do not fit the presentation of sudden travel and amnesia for personal identity.",9
6368,"The patient is experiencing new-onset urinary incontinence with urgency and increased frequency, which could be indicative of a urinary tract infection (UTI), especially given her age and the acute change in symptoms. The most appropriate initial step is to rule out a UTI, which is a common and treatable cause of these symptoms in elderly patients. Therefore, performing a urinalysis and culture is the most appropriate next step to identify or exclude an infection.",9
6381,"The patient presents with difficulty swallowing, an enlarged and tender thyroid gland, and a recent history of an influenza-like illness. These symptoms are suggestive of subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (also known as De Quervain's thyroiditis). This condition often follows a viral infection and is characterized by a painful, tender thyroid gland. The absence of lymphadenopathy and the acute nature of the symptoms further support this diagnosis. Lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto's thyroiditis) typically present with a non-tender thyroid. Fibrous thyroiditis (Riedel's thyroiditis) is rare and presents with a hard, fixed thyroid gland, which is not described here.",9
6392,"The 12-year-old boy presents with trace proteinuria on urinalysis, but his protein/creatinine ratio is within normal limits (≤ 0.2). He is asymptomatic, and his physical examination is normal. Given his age and the findings, this is likely a case of transient or orthostatic proteinuria, which is common in children and adolescents and usually benign. The most appropriate next step is to monitor the proteinuria over time to ensure it resolves or remains stable. Repeating the urine dipstick in 1 year is a reasonable approach to monitor for any changes, as immediate further testing is not indicated in the absence of other concerning symptoms or abnormal findings.",9
6380,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a condition related to immune complex formation. The key features include fatigue, joint pain, Raynaud's phenomenon (episodic, painful discoloration of fingers), palpable purpura, and neurological symptoms (weakness and decreased sensation). These are indicative of a vasculitis, likely secondary to cryoglobulinemia, which is often associated with hepatitis C infection, especially in individuals with a history of intravenous drug use. The elevated liver enzymes further support liver involvement, possibly due to hepatitis C. Cryoglobulinemia is caused by immune complex deposition in small to medium-sized vessels, leading to the symptoms observed. Therefore, immune complex formation is the most likely explanation for this patient's condition.",9
6390,"In this scenario, the patient is experiencing vaginal bleeding at 32 weeks gestation. The key concern here is the potential for Rh incompatibility, which can lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn if the mother is Rh-negative and the fetus is Rh-positive. RhoGAM (Rh immunoglobulin) is administered to prevent the mother's immune system from developing antibodies against Rh-positive blood cells. 

The standard practice is to administer RhoGAM to Rh-negative mothers at around 28 weeks of gestation and again within 72 hours after delivery if the baby is Rh-positive. Additionally, RhoGAM is given if there is any potential for fetal-maternal hemorrhage, such as in cases of trauma, bleeding, or invasive procedures.

In this case, if the mother is Rh-negative and the father is Rh-positive, there is a risk that the fetus could be Rh-positive, and thus RhoGAM should be administered to prevent sensitization. Therefore, the best management strategy is to administer RhoGAM if the mother is Rh-negative and the father is Rh-positive.",9
6401,"The patient's symptoms and lab findings suggest primary hyperparathyroidism, characterized by hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and elevated PTH levels. In primary hyperparathyroidism, increased PTH leads to increased bone resorption, which can cause subperiosteal bone resorption, particularly noticeable in the phalanges of the hands. This manifests as subperiosteal cortical thinning on radiographs. The other options do not align with the typical radiographic findings of primary hyperparathyroidism.",9
6398,"The patient presents with dysphagia for both solids and liquids, weakness in the hands and legs, atrophy of the tongue, and mixed upper and lower motor neuron signs. The examination reveals decreased muscle strength, muscle stiffness, asymmetric deep tendon reflexes, and an extensor plantar response. These findings suggest a combination of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) involvement. 

- **Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)** is characterized by both UMN and LMN signs, such as muscle weakness, atrophy, fasciculations, hyperreflexia, and spasticity. The presence of tongue atrophy and dysphagia aligns with bulbar involvement seen in ALS.

- **Inclusion-body myositis** primarily causes muscle weakness and atrophy but does not typically present with UMN signs like hyperreflexia or an extensor plantar response.

- **Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord** is associated with vitamin B12 deficiency and presents with sensory deficits and UMN signs, but not LMN signs like muscle atrophy.

- **Cervical spondylosis with myelopathy** can cause UMN signs due to spinal cord compression but would not explain the tongue atrophy or LMN signs in the limbs.

Given the combination of symptoms and signs, ALS is the most likely diagnosis.",9
6404,"The scenario describes a man who is consciously deciding to set aside his worries about an upcoming presentation to enjoy his vacation. This indicates a deliberate choice to not think about the stressor until later, which is characteristic of suppression. Suppression is a mature defense mechanism where an individual consciously chooses to postpone attention to a conscious impulse or conflict. The other options do not fit this scenario: Isolation of affect involves separating emotions from thoughts, introjection involves internalizing the qualities of another person, and regression involves reverting to an earlier stage of development.",9
6397,"The patient presents with acute respiratory symptoms and a history of COPD, which could be exacerbated by running out of his albuterol inhaler. Given his recent travel to Arkansas, there is also a potential for exposure to infections endemic to that region, such as histoplasmosis. The normal D-dimer reduces the likelihood of a pulmonary embolism. The most appropriate next step is to obtain a chest radiograph to evaluate for any acute changes in the lungs, such as infection, pneumothorax, or other abnormalities that could explain his symptoms. This is a non-invasive, quick, and informative test that can guide further management.",9
6396,"The patient's symptoms and urinalysis findings are consistent with a urinary tract infection (UTI). The urine culture grows gram-negative, oxidase-negative rods that form greenish colonies on eosin-methylene blue (EMB) agar, which is characteristic of Escherichia coli. E. coli is a common cause of UTIs. The virulence factor that increases the risk of infection in UTIs is the presence of fimbriae (pili), which allow the bacteria to adhere to the urinary tract epithelium, facilitating colonization and infection. Lipoteichoic acid is associated with gram-positive bacteria, biofilm production is more relevant to chronic infections, and IgA protease is associated with mucosal pathogens like Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae.",9
6417,"The patient has suffered an acute ischemic stroke affecting the right side of the brain, which has resulted in left-sided hemiparesis. In the acute phase of a stroke, patients often exhibit flaccid paralysis due to the sudden loss of upper motor neuron input. However, as the condition progresses, the typical evolution involves the development of upper motor neuron signs. These include spasticity, hyperreflexia, and a positive Babinski sign. The Babinski sign is indicative of an upper motor neuron lesion and is characterized by dorsiflexion of the big toe and fanning of the other toes when the sole of the foot is stimulated. This is a classic finding in the progression of an upper motor neuron lesion such as a stroke.",9
6423,"The patient is a 24-year-old woman who is sexually active with multiple partners and uses condoms consistently. She has no history of abnormal Pap smears, and her last Pap smear was 13 months ago. According to current guidelines, women aged 21-29 should have a Pap smear every 3 years. HPV testing is not recommended for women under 30 as part of routine screening unless there are abnormal Pap smear results. HPV vaccination is recommended for individuals up to age 26 if they have not been previously vaccinated. Syphilis testing is typically recommended for individuals at increased risk, but it is not routinely recommended for all sexually active women. Mammography is not recommended for women under 40 unless there is a high risk of breast cancer. Given her age and sexual activity, the most appropriate recommendation is HPV vaccination if she has not already completed the series.",9
6421,"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of a lumbar radiculopathy, likely due to a disc herniation. The key findings include back pain radiating down the lateral thigh, decreased sensation at the left knee, decreased patellar reflex, and a positive straight leg raise test. These findings are consistent with an L4 nerve root compression. 

A disc herniation at the L3/L4 level would typically compress the L4 nerve root, leading to decreased sensation over the medial aspect of the knee, decreased patellar reflex, and pain radiating down the lateral thigh. 

A disc herniation at the L4/L5 level would more likely affect the L5 nerve root, causing different sensory and reflex changes, such as decreased sensation over the dorsum of the foot and weakness in dorsiflexion, which are not present in this case.

Spinal metastasis from lung cancer and vertebral compression fracture are less likely given the acute onset during lifting, the absence of systemic symptoms, and the specific neurological findings.

Therefore, the most likely etiology for this patient's pain is a disc herniation at the L3/L4 vertebra.",9
6420,"The patient presents with hematuria, hemoptysis, and a history of frequent lung infections. The combination of renal and pulmonary symptoms suggests a systemic disease affecting both organs. The spontaneous nosebleed and elevated inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP) further suggest a vasculitic process. 

Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (A) typically follows a streptococcal infection and is characterized by hematuria, but it does not usually cause pulmonary symptoms like hemoptysis.

IgA nephropathy (B) is characterized by recurrent episodes of hematuria, often following upper respiratory infections, but it does not typically cause pulmonary symptoms.

Goodpasture syndrome (C) involves the presence of anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies leading to pulmonary hemorrhage and glomerulonephritis. However, it is less likely to cause systemic symptoms like nosebleeds and elevated inflammatory markers.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (D), formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis, is a small-vessel vasculitis that can cause upper respiratory tract symptoms (such as nosebleeds), pulmonary involvement (hemoptysis), and renal involvement (hematuria). The presence of frequent lung infections and the current symptoms align well with this diagnosis.

Given the combination of symptoms and laboratory findings, Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is the most likely diagnosis.",9
6428,"The key points in this case are the increased bleeding during circumcision, the prolonged PTT, normal PT, normal platelet count, and the family history of bleeding (notably in the maternal grandfather). These findings suggest a disorder of the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Von Willebrand disease can cause prolonged PTT, but it typically also affects platelet function and would often present with a family history affecting both genders. Glanzmann thrombasthenia and Bernard-Soulier syndrome are platelet function disorders and would not cause isolated prolonged PTT. Hemophilia A, an X-linked recessive disorder, is characterized by a deficiency of factor VIII, leading to prolonged PTT with normal PT and platelet count. The family history of bleeding in the maternal grandfather and the boy's symptoms are consistent with Hemophilia A.",9
6434,"The patient presents with asthma, chronic sinusitis, peripheral neuropathy (foot drop), and eosinophilia, which are key features of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome. The presence of tender subcutaneous nodules, renal involvement (elevated creatinine and red blood cell casts), and a high eosinophil count further support this diagnosis. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) typically involves necrotizing granulomas and is associated with c-ANCA, but does not usually present with eosinophilia. Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) can have renal involvement but lacks the eosinophilia and asthma seen in this case. Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) does not typically involve the lungs or cause eosinophilia. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.",9
6438,"The patient developed a severe allergic reaction during the blood transfusion, characterized by urticarial rash, wheezing, fever, and hypotension. This is indicative of an anaphylactic reaction, which is often associated with IgA deficiency. Patients with IgA deficiency can have severe allergic reactions to blood products containing IgA. The clue in the options is a history of frequent sinopulmonary infections, which is common in patients with IgA deficiency due to their impaired mucosal immunity. Therefore, the scenario most consistent with this patient's reaction is a history of frequent sinopulmonary infections, suggesting an underlying IgA deficiency.",9
6441,"The patient's syncope episodes are triggered by pressure on the neck, such as when adjusting a necktie. This suggests a reflex mechanism rather than a structural cardiac issue, orthostatic hypotension, or a panic attack. Carotid sinus hypersensitivity is a condition where pressure on the carotid sinus (located in the neck) leads to a reflex that causes a drop in heart rate and blood pressure, resulting in syncope. The patient's normal vital signs and lack of orthostatic hypotension make orthostatic syncope unlikely. The absence of panic symptoms and the specific trigger make a panic attack unlikely. The low QRS voltage and infrequent PVCs are not directly related to the syncope episodes. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is carotid sinus hypersensitivity.",9
6447,"The patient presents with acute onset facial weakness on the right side, inability to move the right side of his face, and loss of taste. These symptoms are consistent with Bell's palsy, which is a peripheral facial nerve (CN VII) palsy. The facial nerve exits the skull through the stylomastoid foramen. The loss of taste suggests involvement of the chorda tympani, a branch of the facial nerve, which also passes through this area. Therefore, the most likely source of the lesion affecting the facial nerve is at the stylomastoid foramen.",9
6448,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of acute pancreatitis, such as epigastric pain radiating to the back and vomiting. The presence of yellow plaques on the skin, known as xanthomas, suggests hyperlipidemia, which can be a risk factor for pancreatitis. Additionally, the patient has a low serum calcium level, which can be associated with pancreatitis. Given these findings, measuring serum lipid levels is important to evaluate for hypertriglyceridemia as a potential cause of the pancreatitis.",9
6457,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of gas gangrene, which is characterized by fever, severe pain, swelling, crepitus, and foul-smelling discharge. The presence of crepitus indicates gas production in the tissues, which is a hallmark of gas gangrene. The most common organism responsible for gas gangrene is Clostridium perfringens, an anaerobic, spore-forming bacterium. The patient's occupation as a farmer and the nature of the injury (a cut from a sickle) increase the likelihood of exposure to Clostridium spores, which are commonly found in soil. The rapid progression of symptoms and the presence of blisters and darkened skin further support this diagnosis.",9
6454,"The clinical presentation suggests a primary immunodeficiency, likely X-linked agammaglobulinemia (Bruton's agammaglobulinemia), given the recurrent bacterial infections starting after 6 months of age and the family history of a maternal uncle with a similar issue. This condition is characterized by a defect in B cell development due to a mutation in the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) gene, leading to very low or absent B cells and low immunoglobulin levels. Therefore, if blood work were drawn, we would expect to find an abnormally low number of B cells.",9
6469,"The positive predictive value (PPV) is the probability that subjects with a positive screening test truly have the disease. It is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the total number of positive test results (true positives + false positives). 

In this study:
- True positives (TP) = 400 (patients with NHL who tested positive)
- False positives (FP) = 0 (control patients who tested positive)

PPV = TP / (TP + FP) = 400 / (400 + 0) = 400 / 400 = 1 or 100%.",10
6473,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of an infection with Actinomyces, which is characterized by a chronic, slowly progressive infection that can form abscesses and sinus tracts. The Gram stain showing gram-positive filamentous rods supports this diagnosis. Actinomyces infections are typically treated with high-dose penicillin. However, given the patient's history of a generalized rash after receiving amoxicillin, there is a concern for a penicillin allergy. In such cases, doxycycline is an alternative treatment option for actinomycosis. Surgical resection is not the first-line treatment, and cephalexin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are not appropriate for this type of infection.",9
6474,"The patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with anemia, likely due to his end-stage renal disease (ESRD). His hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are low, indicating anemia. In ESRD, the kidneys are unable to produce adequate erythropoietin, leading to anemia. The appropriate long-term therapy for anemia in the context of ESRD is erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), such as erythropoietin or darbepoetin. A known side effect of ESAs is hypertension, as they can increase blood pressure in patients receiving this treatment. Therefore, the side effect of the long-term therapy this patient should be started on is hypertension.",9
6467,"The patient presents with hyperkalemia (serum potassium 6.5 mEq/L) and metabolic acidosis (blood pH 7.32, serum bicarbonate 19 mEq/L). The ECG shows peaked T waves, which are indicative of hyperkalemia. The urine anion gap is positive (20 meq/L), suggesting a renal tubular acidosis (RTA) rather than a gastrointestinal loss of bicarbonate. 

Given the patient's history of hypertension and diabetes, and the use of captopril (an ACE inhibitor), the most likely cause of hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis is hypoaldosteronism. ACE inhibitors can lead to decreased aldosterone secretion, which results in impaired potassium excretion and hydrogen ion excretion in the distal nephron, causing hyperkalemia and a type of renal tubular acidosis known as hyperkalemic RTA or type 4 RTA.

Therefore, the primary defect responsible for this patient's condition is decreased aldosterone secretion.",9
6481,"The clinical presentation of a barking cough, fever, and difficulty breathing in a 5-year-old boy suggests croup, which is commonly caused by the parainfluenza virus. Croup is characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the upper airway, particularly the subglottic region. A chest radiograph in such cases often shows the classic 'steeple sign,' which is the narrowing of the upper trachea and subglottis. This finding supports the diagnosis of croup due to parainfluenza virus. The other options describe symptoms and findings associated with different conditions: B is associated with mumps, C with rabies, and D with rubella.",9
6482,"The patient's symptoms and signs suggest hypothyroidism. Fatigue, generalized weakness, constipation, weight gain despite dieting, dry skin, bradycardia (pulse of 50/min), and delayed deep tendon reflexes are all consistent with this condition. Hypothyroidism can lead to elevated serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) due to decreased metabolism of lipids. Hyperglycemia is more associated with hyperthyroidism or diabetes. Decreased serum creatinine is not typically associated with hypothyroidism. Decreased serum creatine kinase is also not typical; in fact, hypothyroidism can sometimes cause elevated creatine kinase due to muscle involvement. Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient with suspected hypothyroidism is elevated serum LDL.",9
6491,"The patient presents with fatigue, weight loss, and pancytopenia (anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia). The peripheral blood smear shows numerous blast cells that stain positive for myeloperoxidase, CD33, and CD34. Myeloperoxidase positivity indicates myeloid lineage, which is characteristic of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). CD33 and CD34 are markers commonly associated with myeloid progenitor cells. The presence of these markers and the clinical presentation are consistent with AML. Hairy cell leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia have different marker profiles and clinical presentations.",9
6489,"The patient is a 16-year-old who is sexually active and requests contraception. She smokes half a pack of cigarettes per day, which is a risk factor for complications with certain contraceptive methods, particularly combined oral contraceptive pills (COCs) due to the increased risk of thromboembolism. However, she is under 35, which makes the risk lower than in older women. The most appropriate step is to discuss all effective contraceptive options with her, considering her smoking status and desire for confidentiality. This discussion should include the risks and benefits of each method, including non-oral options like IUDs or implants, which may be more suitable given her smoking habit. Parental consent is not required for discussing contraception with a minor in many jurisdictions, and it is important to respect her confidentiality. Therefore, the best next step is to discuss all effective contraceptive options.",9
6490,"The patient's symptoms suggest normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), characterized by the triad of gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and cognitive dysfunction. The wide-based, slow gait, memory issues, and urinary incontinence align with this diagnosis. In NPH, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) accumulation leads to these symptoms, and a lumbar puncture can help relieve pressure and improve symptoms. Therefore, the most likely treatment to improve his symptoms is a lumbar puncture.",9
6483,"The patient's symptoms of palpitations, sweating, jitteriness, weakness, and tingling, along with her normal vital signs except for mild tachycardia, suggest a possible episode of hypoglycemia. The fact that she has been seen multiple times for similar symptoms and has a family history of Grave's disease might initially suggest a thyroid issue, but the acute presentation and neurological symptoms (weakness, tingling) are more consistent with hypoglycemia. Checking a fingerstick blood glucose is a quick, non-invasive test that can immediately confirm or rule out hypoglycemia as the cause of her symptoms. This is a critical step because if she is hypoglycemic, it requires urgent correction.",9
6493,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are suggestive of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), particularly the limited form known as CREST syndrome (Calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, Esophageal dysmotility, Sclerodactyly, and Telangiectasia). The esophageal motility study findings of absence of peristalsis and decreased lower esophageal sphincter pressure are consistent with esophageal involvement in scleroderma. The taut skin, limited range of motion of the fingers, and telangiectasias further support this diagnosis.

In systemic sclerosis, particularly the limited form, there is often involvement of the kidneys, which can lead to scleroderma renal crisis. This condition is characterized by hypertension and renal failure due to thickening of the arteriolar walls (intimal proliferation) in the kidneys. Therefore, further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show arteriolar wall thickening in the kidney.

The other options are less likely: 
- Amyloid deposits in the liver are associated with amyloidosis, not scleroderma.
- Budding yeasts on the oral mucosa suggest oral candidiasis, which is not directly related to scleroderma.
- Parasite nests in the myocardium are indicative of Chagas disease, not scleroderma.

Thus, the most likely finding is arteriolar wall thickening in the kidney.",9
6504,"The patient presents with proximal muscle weakness (difficulty lifting arms) and a rash around the eyes and on the face, neck, and chest. These symptoms are characteristic of dermatomyositis, which is an inflammatory condition affecting the skin and muscles. The rash around the eyes is known as a heliotrope rash, and the muscle weakness is typically proximal. Polymyalgia rheumatica usually presents with pain and stiffness rather than weakness and is more common in older individuals. Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is associated with muscle weakness but typically improves with activity and is often linked to malignancies. Fibromyalgia is characterized by widespread pain and fatigue, not specific muscle weakness or rash. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is dermatomyositis.",9
6496,"The patient's symptoms of difficulty swallowing, retrosternal chest pain, and epigastric tenderness suggest esophageal or gastric irritation. The use of risedronate, a bisphosphonate, is known to cause esophagitis and gastritis, especially if not taken properly (e.g., without adequate water or remaining upright after ingestion). The symptoms are consistent with esophagitis, possibly due to risedronate. Temporarily stopping risedronate and starting a proton pump inhibitor like esomeprazole can help manage the symptoms by reducing gastric acid and allowing healing of the esophageal lining. An upper GI endoscopy could be considered if symptoms persist despite treatment, but the immediate step is to address the likely cause of the symptoms.",9
6505,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of schizophrenia, including delusions (believing her family is poisoning her), social withdrawal, and a decline in self-care over the past two years. She also exhibits signs of thought disorder, such as providing vague answers and appearing distracted. The first-line treatment for schizophrenia typically involves the use of atypical antipsychotics. Among the options provided, olanzapine and risperidone are atypical antipsychotics. Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant, and trazodone is primarily used for depression and insomnia, making them inappropriate choices for schizophrenia. Both olanzapine and risperidone are effective, but risperidone is often preferred due to a more favorable side effect profile, particularly concerning weight gain, which is relevant given the patient's obesity and pre-diabetes.",9
6511,"The patient's symptoms of muscle pain, neck stiffness, and difficulty standing up, along with morning stiffness that improves throughout the day, are suggestive of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). This condition is common in older adults and is often associated with an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The low-grade fever and systemic symptoms also support this diagnosis. The best next step in management is to check the ESR to confirm the suspicion of PMR, as it is typically elevated in this condition.",9
6521,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of cryptococcal meningitis, which is common in HIV-positive individuals. The key findings include headaches, nuchal rigidity, increased CSF protein, decreased CSF glucose, and encapsulated yeast with narrow-based buds on India ink staining. Cryptococcus neoformans is the organism responsible, and it is known for its polysaccharide capsule. A latex agglutination test of the CSF is used to detect the cryptococcal antigen, which would be positive in this case. The other options do not directly relate to cryptococcal meningitis: cotton-wool spots are associated with CMV retinitis, acid-fast cysts in stool suggest parasitic infections like Cryptosporidium, and frontotemporal atrophy is related to neurodegenerative diseases.",9
6508,"The patient is experiencing 'wearing-off' phenomena with his current levodopa/carbidopa regimen, where symptoms worsen as the next dose approaches. This is common in long-term Parkinson's disease management. To address this, a drug that prolongs the effect of levodopa is often added. Entacapone is a COMT inhibitor that prevents the breakdown of levodopa, thereby increasing its availability and duration of action. This helps reduce the 'wearing-off' effect. Benztropine is an anticholinergic used for tremor, Selegiline is an MAO-B inhibitor similar to rasagiline, and Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist. However, Entacapone specifically targets the 'wearing-off' by enhancing levodopa efficacy.",9
6520,"The experimental drug described in the question irreversibly binds to DPP-IV (dipeptidyl peptidase-4), which is an enzyme responsible for the degradation of incretin hormones like GLP-1. By inhibiting DPP-IV, the drug would increase the levels of active GLP-1, thereby enhancing its effects on insulin secretion and glucose regulation. Among the options provided, Sitagliptin is a DPP-IV inhibitor, which means it works by inhibiting the same enzyme, although Sitagliptin is a reversible inhibitor. Therefore, Sitagliptin has a similar mechanism of action to the experimental drug described.",9
6524,"The patient is presenting with hematemesis and signs of hemodynamic instability, including tachycardia and hypotension, which are worsening. He also shows signs of altered mental status, indicating potential hypovolemic shock or significant blood loss. In such a scenario, airway protection is crucial, especially given his altered mental status and risk of aspiration. Intubation would secure the airway and allow for better management of his respiratory status while further interventions are performed. While IV fluids, blood products, and plasma are important for stabilizing his hemodynamics, securing the airway takes precedence in this acute setting.",9
6529,"The patient has symptoms consistent with salicylate toxicity, including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and tinnitus. The arterial blood gas shows a low PCO2, indicating respiratory alkalosis, which is common in early salicylate poisoning due to hyperventilation. The elevated PO2 is due to the hyperventilation as well. The blood salicylate level is significantly elevated at 55 mg/dL.

In salicylate toxicity, management involves enhancing the elimination of salicylates and correcting the acid-base disturbance. Alkalinization of the urine increases the ionization of salicylates, reducing their reabsorption in the renal tubules and enhancing their excretion. Additionally, alkalinization of the serum can help mitigate the effects of metabolic acidosis that can develop as the toxicity progresses.

Therefore, the correct management involves serum alkalization and urine alkalization.",9
6533,"During short, fast sprints, the muscles primarily rely on anaerobic glycolysis for energy production. This process converts glucose to pyruvate, which is then reduced to lactate in the absence of sufficient oxygen. This conversion regenerates NAD+ from NADH, allowing glycolysis to continue. As a result, lactate accumulates in the blood, leading to an increase in H+ concentration, causing a decrease in pH (acidosis). Therefore, after a workout session consisting of short, fast sprints, the blood is likely to show an increased concentration of H+ due to the accumulation of lactic acid.",9
6538,"The patient presents with oliguria and elevated serum creatinine levels four weeks after a kidney transplant, suggesting acute kidney injury. He is on cyclosporine, an immunosuppressant, but admits to non-compliance, which increases the risk of acute rejection. The elevated blood pressure and mild tenderness over the kidney also support this. In the context of a kidney transplant, acute rejection is often characterized by lymphocytic infiltration and damage to the graft's endothelial cells. This is consistent with acute cellular rejection, where histological examination would show lymphocytic infiltration of the interstitium and tubules, as well as possible endothelial damage in the vessels. Therefore, the best histological finding in this scenario would be lymphocytic infiltration of graft vessels and endothelial damage.",9
6537,"The child has a palpable mass in the left inguinal canal, suggesting an undescended testis (cryptorchidism). In infants, it is common to wait until 6 months of age to see if the testis descends spontaneously. Since the child is 7 months old, it is appropriate to consider surgical intervention. Orchidopexy is typically recommended between 6 months and 1 year of age to reduce the risk of infertility and testicular cancer. Gonadotropin therapy is not the first-line treatment for cryptorchidism. Serum testosterone level is not indicated in this scenario. Reassurance is not appropriate as the child is past the age where spontaneous descent is likely.",9
6546,"The patient is likely experiencing ventricular tachycardia, given the description of wide, monomorphic sawtooth-like QRS complexes. Synchronized cardioversion and epinephrine have been ineffective. The concern is minimizing the risk of developing multifocal ventricular tachycardia, which is often associated with torsades de pointes, a type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that can occur with drugs that prolong the QT interval. 

Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic that is effective in treating ventricular tachycardia and does not significantly increase the risk of torsades de pointes compared to other class III agents. Ibutilide and sotalol both prolong the QT interval and increase the risk of torsades de pointes. Procainamide is a class IA antiarrhythmic that also prolongs the QT interval and can increase the risk of torsades de pointes.

Therefore, the best choice to minimize the risk of developing multifocal ventricular tachycardia is amiodarone, as it is less likely to cause torsades de pointes compared to the other options.",9
6560,"The patient's presentation suggests a hemolytic anemia. Key features include recurrent pallor during infections, jaundice (icteric sclera), and splenomegaly. The laboratory findings show anemia with a high reticulocyte count, indicating a compensatory response to hemolysis. The presence of Heinz bodies on the peripheral smear is particularly indicative of oxidative damage to red blood cells, which is characteristic of Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. The negative Coombs test rules out autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Hereditary spherocytosis typically shows spherocytes on the smear, not Heinz bodies. Sickle cell disease would present with sickle-shaped cells and vaso-occlusive crises, which are not described here. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is G6PD deficiency.",9
6556,"The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The key points include the constant and gnawing lower abdominal pain that radiates to the back and groin, which is characteristic of an AAA. The palpable pulsatile mass below the umbilicus is a classic finding for an AAA. His history of smoking and hypertension are significant risk factors for the development of an AAA. The sudden onset of hypotension and unresponsiveness during transfer indicates a likely rupture of the aneurysm, leading to massive internal bleeding and shock. Other options like gastrointestinal hemorrhage, appendicitis, and irritable bowel syndrome do not fit the clinical picture as well as a ruptured AAA does.",9
6558,"To determine the incidence rate, we need to calculate the number of new cases per person-years of follow-up. 

For Study 1:
- Number of patients = 3000
- Follow-up period = 10 years
- New cases of lymphoma = 30
- Total person-years = 3000 patients * 10 years = 30,000 person-years
- Incidence rate = 30 cases / 30,000 person-years = 1 case per 1000 person-years

For Study 2:
- Number of patients = 300
- Follow-up period = 30 years
- New cases of lymphoma = 9
- Total person-years = 300 patients * 30 years = 9,000 person-years
- Incidence rate = 9 cases / 9,000 person-years = 1 case per 1000 person-years

Both studies have the same incidence rate of 1 case per 1000 person-years. Therefore, the risks are equivalent.",10
6552,"The symptoms described in the vignette include irritability, fatigue, loss of appetite, loss of interest in activities (anhedonia), excessive sleep, poor academic performance, and changes in behavior. These symptoms have been present for 3 weeks. The key points to consider are the duration and the impact on functioning.

- **Substance abuse (A)**: The vignette does not provide evidence of ongoing substance use that could explain the symptoms. The patient tried alcohol once but there is no indication of regular use.

- **Major depressive disorder (B)**: This diagnosis requires at least 5 symptoms of depression for a minimum of 2 weeks, causing significant impairment. The symptoms include depressed mood (or irritability in adolescents), anhedonia, changes in sleep, appetite, and concentration, which are all present in this case.

- **Adjustment disorder with depressed mood (C)**: This diagnosis involves emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor, occurring within 3 months of the stressor. While the grandfather's death could be a stressor, the symptoms are more severe and pervasive than typically seen in adjustment disorder.

- **Persistent depressive disorder (D)**: This requires a depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than not, for at least 2 years. The duration in this case is only 3 weeks.

Given the severity and duration of symptoms, and the significant impact on functioning, the most appropriate diagnosis is Major depressive disorder.",9
6565,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of nephrotic syndrome, characterized by significant proteinuria (4+), hypoalbuminemia (albumin 1.6 g/dL), hyperlipidemia (cholesterol 479 mg/dL), and edema. The kidney biopsy shows thickening of the glomerular capillary loops and the basal membrane. This histological finding is characteristic of membranous nephropathy, which is often associated with solid tumors, such as lung cancer, especially in older patients with a history of smoking. The presence of a right upper lobe density on chest x-ray suggests a possible lung malignancy, which could be the underlying cause of the membranous nephropathy in this patient.",9
6582,"The presentation of easy bruising after minor trauma, along with the family history of an unknown blood disorder, suggests a possible bleeding disorder. The pale skin and blue irises could indicate a connective tissue disorder, but these are not specific. The best initial step is to evaluate for a bleeding disorder, which can be done with a complete blood count (CBC) and coagulation panel. This will help identify any abnormalities in platelet count or coagulation factors, which are common causes of easy bruising in children. Genetic testing and hemoglobin electrophoresis are not immediate steps for this presentation, and alerting the police is not warranted without further evidence of abuse.",9
6573,"The patient is experiencing anxiety specifically related to giving oral presentations at work, which suggests performance anxiety or social anxiety disorder. Her symptoms include a racing heart and sweating during these presentations. Propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, is effective for managing the physical symptoms of anxiety, such as tachycardia and sweating, particularly in performance situations. Olanzapine is an antipsychotic, which is not appropriate for this situation. Venlafaxine and Sertraline are antidepressants that can be used for generalized anxiety disorder or social anxiety disorder, but they are not as effective for acute performance anxiety as propranolol. Therefore, propranolol is the most appropriate choice for her specific symptoms.",9
6580,"The patient has HIV with a CD4+ count of 405/mm3, which is below the normal threshold but not severely low. At this level, the patient is at risk for certain opportunistic infections and conditions, but not the most severe ones typically seen with CD4+ counts below 200/mm3. 

- **A. Violaceous lesions on skin exam**: These are indicative of Kaposi's sarcoma, which can occur at higher CD4+ counts but is more common with counts below 500/mm3.

- **B. Cotton-wool spots on fundoscopy**: These are associated with CMV retinitis, which typically occurs at CD4+ counts below 50/mm3.

- **C. Ring-enhancing lesions on brain MRI**: These are characteristic of cerebral toxoplasmosis, which usually occurs at CD4+ counts below 100/mm3.

- **D. Ground-glass opacities on chest CT**: These are indicative of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), which is more common with CD4+ counts below 200/mm3.

Given the CD4+ count of 405/mm3, the most likely finding would be related to Kaposi's sarcoma, as it can occur at this level, especially in a noncompliant patient.",9
6588,"The scenario describes a drug that decreases urinary sodium concentration and increases urinary potassium concentration. This suggests that the drug is causing sodium retention and potassium excretion. Aldosterone is a hormone that acts on the distal nephron of the kidney to increase sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion, leading to decreased urinary sodium and increased urinary potassium. Therefore, the effect of substance X on the kidneys is similar to the effect of aldosterone.",9
6595,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with hepatitis, such as malaise, anorexia, vomiting, and dark urine. The laboratory findings show HBsAg positivity, indicating an active hepatitis B infection. The presence of HBeAg and high HBV DNA levels suggest active viral replication. The absence of IgM anti-HBc indicates that this is not an acute infection, as IgM anti-HBc is typically present in acute hepatitis B infections. The presence of HBeAg antibody is unusual but can occur in chronic infections. The elevated alpha-fetoprotein suggests liver inflammation or damage, which can occur in chronic hepatitis B. These findings are consistent with an acute exacerbation of chronic HBV infection, where the virus becomes more active, leading to increased symptoms and liver inflammation.",9
6593,"The patient presents with cognitive changes, mood alterations, constipation, cough, weight loss, and hypercalcemia. The lab results show elevated calcium levels with low PTH, suggesting a non-parathyroid cause of hypercalcemia. Given her significant smoking history and symptoms, the most likely cause is a malignancy, specifically a paraneoplastic syndrome. The low PTH and high calcium are consistent with ectopic production of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), commonly associated with squamous cell lung cancer. This fits the neoplastic category.",9
6605,"The patient's symptoms are indicative of narcolepsy with cataplexy. The key features include excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (sudden muscle weakness triggered by strong emotions), hypnagogic hallucinations (seeing bright colors as she falls asleep), and sleep paralysis (inability to move when falling asleep or waking up). Sodium oxybate is the most appropriate nighttime pharmacotherapy for narcolepsy with cataplexy as it helps improve nighttime sleep, reduces cataplexy, and decreases daytime sleepiness.",9
6607,"The patient's presentation includes multiple painful, purulent ulcers on the vulva with tender inguinal lymphadenopathy. The ulcers are described as having a necrotic base. This presentation is most consistent with chancroid, which is caused by Haemophilus ducreyi. Chancroid typically presents with painful genital ulcers and tender suppurative inguinal lymphadenopathy. Genital herpes (caused by HSV) also presents with painful ulcers, but these are usually vesicular and not purulent or necrotic. A chancre, associated with primary syphilis, is typically a single, painless ulcer. Lymphogranuloma venereum, caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, usually presents with painless ulcers followed by painful lymphadenopathy, not purulent ulcers. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is chancroid.",9
6615,"The patient initially had symptoms consistent with a viral upper respiratory infection, likely influenza, given the muscle aches, headache, fever, and rhinorrhea. Following this, she developed symptoms of a secondary bacterial pneumonia, indicated by the productive cough with blood-tinged sputum, shortness of breath, and the findings on chest x-ray. The x-ray shows bilateral lobar opacities and thin-walled cystic spaces with air-fluid levels, which are suggestive of lung abscesses. Staphylococcus aureus is known to cause post-viral pneumonia and can lead to the formation of lung abscesses due to its ability to cause necrotizing pneumonia. The other options are less likely: Mycobacterium tuberculosis typically causes chronic symptoms and cavitary lesions, Legionella pneumoniae is associated with specific risk factors and does not typically cause abscesses, and Streptococcus agalactiae is not a common cause of pneumonia in adults.",9
6576,"The patient's presentation is consistent with possible hypocalcemia. He has perioral numbness and muscle pain, which are common signs of hypocalcemia. Following blood transfusions, citrate in transfused blood can chelate calcium, leading to a temporary decrease in ionized calcium levels. This patient received 3 units of blood, which could precipitate hypocalcemia due to citrate binding calcium. Therefore, the laboratory findings would likely show hypocalcemia, but since this is not an option, we infer the answer relates to a condition that mimics hypocalcemia or is related. Hypomagnesemia can also complicate hypocalcemia, as low magnesium levels can lead to decreased parathyroid hormone secretion, contributing to low calcium levels. However, given the direct impact of transfusion on calcium, hypercalcemia would be a mismatch here. Therefore, the best choice related to the symptoms and transfusion history is hypomagnesemia, which can present similarly and disrupts calcium metabolism.",9
6617,"The patient presents with symptoms of meningitis (headache, fever, neck stiffness) and has a history of HIV with inconsistent antiretroviral therapy, suggesting immunosuppression. The lumbar puncture results show a mononuclear predominance in the white blood cell count, low glucose, and elevated protein, which are indicative of a fungal or mycobacterial infection. Cryptococcus neoformans is a common cause of meningitis in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with HIV/AIDS. The preparation of the cerebrospinal fluid likely shows encapsulated yeast, which is characteristic of Cryptococcus neoformans. The other options are less likely given the presentation and typical geographic distribution (e.g., Coccidioides immitis is more common in the southwestern United States).",9
6619,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest a parasitic infection, likely a helminth. The key points include recurrent abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, eosinophilia (46%), and a history of playing outdoors with a pet dog. The palpable mass in the right upper quadrant and hepatomegaly suggest visceral involvement. The significant eosinophilia and the presence of a solid mass are indicative of a parasitic infection causing visceral larva migrans. Toxocara canis, a dog roundworm, is known to cause visceral larva migrans in humans, especially in children who have contact with dogs. The eosinophilia and hepatomegaly align with this diagnosis. Ancylostoma braziliense is associated with cutaneous larva migrans, not visceral. Ascaris lumbricoides typically causes intestinal symptoms and not a solid mass in the liver. Toxocara cati is similar to Toxocara canis but is associated with cats, not dogs. Therefore, the organism most likely responsible is Toxocara canis.",9
6627,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of hyperthyroidism, such as feeling warm, muscle weakness, mood swings, fatigue, tachycardia, and hyperreflexia. During pregnancy, hyperthyroidism is often due to Graves' disease. Radioactive iodine (I-31) is contraindicated in pregnancy due to its potential to harm the fetal thyroid gland. Propylthiouracil (PTU) is preferred in the first trimester of pregnancy for treating hyperthyroidism because it has a lower risk of teratogenic effects compared to methimazole. Prednisone and intravenous immunoglobulin are not appropriate treatments for hyperthyroidism. Therefore, the best therapy for this pregnant patient with hyperthyroidism is Propylthiouracil.",9
6634,"The patient's symptoms and lab findings suggest a vitamin B12 deficiency, as indicated by the megaloblastic anemia and neurological symptoms (paresthesias and decreased proprioception). The Schilling test was performed to determine the cause of the B12 deficiency. In the first part of the test, no radiolabeled vitamin B12 appeared in the urine, suggesting malabsorption. When intrinsic factor was added in the second part of the test, 20% of the radiolabeled vitamin appeared in the urine, indicating that the deficiency was due to a lack of intrinsic factor. This is characteristic of pernicious anemia, where the body produces antibodies against intrinsic factor, preventing B12 absorption.",9
6630,"The clinical presentation suggests septic arthritis, likely due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae, given the patient's sexual history and the partner's symptoms. The synovial fluid analysis shows a high WBC count with a predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, consistent with bacterial infection. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a gram-negative diplococcus that is known to selectively grow on Thayer-Martin medium, which is a selective medium used to isolate Neisseria species. This medium contains antibiotics that inhibit the growth of other bacteria, allowing Neisseria to be isolated. The other options do not describe characteristics of Neisseria gonorrhoeae: 
- Option A describes a toxin associated with Corynebacterium diphtheriae.
- Option B describes Neisseria meningitidis, which ferments maltose.
- Option C describes a reaction associated with the treatment of syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum.
Thus, the correct answer is that Neisseria gonorrhoeae selectively grows on Thayer-Martin medium.",10
6631,"The patient's age, symptoms, and imaging findings are key to diagnosing this condition. The patient is a 14-year-old boy with leg pain and x-ray findings of lytic lesions in the diaphysis of the femur with a surrounding cortex covered by layers of new bone. This description is characteristic of Ewing sarcoma, which typically presents in children and adolescents with pain and swelling. The x-ray findings of ""onion skin"" periosteal reaction (layers of new bone) and the biopsy showing small round blue cells further support this diagnosis. Chondroblastoma and osteochondroma are less likely due to their typical locations and presentations, and osteoid osteoma usually presents with pain relieved by NSAIDs, which is not the case here.",9
6628,"The newborn in this scenario is presenting with signs of a serious infection, likely sepsis, given the fever, poor feeding, irritability, and respiratory distress. The elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a key cytokine involved in the acute phase response to infection. IL-6 is known to stimulate the liver to produce acute phase proteins, including fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, and others. These proteins play roles in inflammation and the body's response to infection. Specifically, IL-6 increases the release of fibrinogen, which is part of the body's response to inflammation and helps in the clotting process. The other options do not directly relate to the primary role of IL-6 in the acute phase response.",9
6641,"During T cell development in the thymus, double-negative T cells (which do not express CD4 or CD8) undergo several stages of maturation. As they progress, they become double-positive T cells, expressing both CD4 and CD8. At this stage, they also express CD3, which is part of the T cell receptor complex. CD3 is present on all mature T cells and is crucial for T cell receptor signaling. CD10 is a marker for early B cell precursors and some lymphomas, CD32 is an Fc receptor, and CD44 is involved in cell adhesion and migration but is not specific to this stage of T cell development. Therefore, the CD molecule most likely to be present on double-positive T cells is CD3.",9
6636,"The patient's symptoms are characteristic of panic attacks, which include sudden onset of palpitations, sweating, shortness of breath, and a choking sensation. These episodes are recurrent, last for a short duration, and occur without warning. The normal ECG, cardiac enzymes, and thyroid hormone levels, along with the absence of substance use, make a cardiac or thyroid cause unlikely. The avoidance behavior (avoiding busy areas) suggests panic disorder with agoraphobia. The most appropriate next step in management for panic disorder is to start an SSRI, such as fluoxetine, which is effective for long-term management. Benzodiazepines like lorazepam can be used for acute relief but are not the first-line treatment for long-term management. D-dimer and echocardiography are not indicated given the clinical presentation and normal initial workup.",9
6637,"The patient's symptoms and sexual history suggest a sexually transmitted infection. The key features include a foul-smelling, thin, yellow-green discharge and a pink, edematous vagina with a red-tan cervix. These findings are characteristic of Trichomonas vaginalis infection, a common sexually transmitted infection. The inconsistent use of condoms and multiple sexual partners increase the risk for such infections. Candida vaginitis typically presents with thick, white, ""cottage cheese""-like discharge, which does not match this patient's presentation. Physiologic leukorrhea is a normal discharge and is not foul-smelling or associated with the described symptoms. Latex allergy would present with itching, burning, and possibly a rash, but not with the described discharge. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Trichomonas vaginalis infection.",9
6655,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of a hereditary polyposis syndrome. The key features include multiple colonic polyps, a family history of colon cancer at a young age, and extracolonic manifestations. The presence of bony swellings (osteomas), subcutaneous nodules with central black pores (epidermoid cysts), and pigmented retinal lesions are characteristic of Gardner syndrome. Gardner syndrome is a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and is associated with extracolonic manifestations such as osteomas, epidermoid cysts, and retinal pigment epithelium hypertrophy. The number of polyps (approximately 150) also supports this diagnosis, as FAP typically presents with numerous colonic polyps.",9
6643,"The patient presents with sudden paralysis of the right side, indicating a left hemisphere stroke. His speech is off-topic and he is unable to appropriately answer questions, suggesting a language disorder. However, he can repeat the word ""fan,"" which indicates that his ability to repeat is intact. This pattern is consistent with Wernicke's aphasia, where comprehension is impaired but repetition can be preserved if the arcuate fasciculus is intact. Wernicke's aphasia is associated with damage to the posterior part of the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant hemisphere, which is part of the temporal lobe. The presence of a normal Babinski reflex (big toe flexes) suggests no upper motor neuron lesion affecting the corticospinal tract. Therefore, the area most likely affected is the temporal lobe.",9
6672,"The patient experienced significant hypotension due to hemorrhagic shock from the motor vehicle accident. Despite fluid resuscitation, his blood pressure remained low until the bleeding was controlled surgically. This period of hypotension likely led to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), a common cause of acute kidney injury following ischemic events. The urinalysis shows RBCs and WBCs, which can be seen in ATN, but the hallmark finding in ATN is the presence of muddy brown casts, which are granular casts formed from necrotic tubular epithelial cells. Other types of casts, such as WBC casts, RBC casts, or fatty casts, are more indicative of other conditions like pyelonephritis, glomerulonephritis, or nephrotic syndrome, respectively. Therefore, given the clinical context of ischemic injury to the kidneys, muddy brown casts are the expected finding.",9
6677,"The newborn is premature, born at 31 weeks' gestation, and has developed neurological symptoms such as seizures, lethargy, and a bulging anterior fontanelle. These symptoms, along with the history of prematurity, suggest a condition common in preterm infants. Germinal matrix hemorrhage (also known as intraventricular hemorrhage) is a common complication in premature infants due to the fragility of the germinal matrix vasculature. The bulging fontanelle and neurological symptoms are consistent with this condition. The other options, such as metabolic disorders and congenital hydrocephalus, do not fit the acute presentation and the specific risk factors associated with prematurity.",9
6675,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis, which is supported by the homozygous missense mutation of the HFE gene. Hereditary hemochromatosis leads to excessive iron accumulation in the body, including the liver. Over time, this iron overload can cause liver damage, progressing from fibrosis to cirrhosis, and eventually increasing the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) and high serum ferritin level are indicative of liver involvement. The negative urine porphyrin test rules out porphyria cutanea tarda, which can present with similar skin findings. Given the genetic mutation and the potential for iron overload, the long-term effect on the liver in hereditary hemochromatosis is an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma.",9
6668,"The clinical presentation suggests a case of IgA nephropathy (Berger's disease). The key features include recurrent episodes of hematuria associated with upper respiratory tract infections (sore throat), which is typical for IgA nephropathy. The presence of dysmorphic RBCs and RBC casts in the urine indicates glomerular bleeding. The normal kidney ultrasound and the absence of systemic symptoms like those seen in lupus nephritis or post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis further support this diagnosis. In IgA nephropathy, renal biopsy typically shows IgA deposition in the mesangium.",9
6685,"The patient presents with swelling and tenderness around the right side of her chin and neck, along with pain when moving her jaw and chewing. These symptoms developed after a tonsillectomy, and she has a fever. The presentation is consistent with acute bacterial parotitis, which is an infection of the parotid gland. This condition can occur postoperatively, especially if there is dehydration or poor oral intake, leading to stasis of saliva and subsequent infection. Mumps is less likely given the patient's age and vaccination history. Sjogren's syndrome typically presents with dry eyes and mouth, not acute swelling and fever. Superior vena cava syndrome would present with more diffuse swelling and other systemic symptoms, not localized tenderness and fever.",9
6681,"The patient is in her 28th week of pregnancy, which places her in the third trimester. The term ""abortion"" typically refers to pregnancy loss before 20 weeks of gestation. Therefore, the options related to abortion (A, B, C, and D) are not applicable in this context. However, the symptoms described—vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain with a closed cervical os and positive fetal cardiac activity—are consistent with a threatened abortion if this were an earlier stage of pregnancy. Given the gestational age, the correct terminology would be a threatened preterm labor, but within the context of the options provided, ""threatened abortion"" is the closest match, acknowledging the limitation of the term due to gestational age.",9
6679,"The patient is experiencing hypoxemia following surgery, with symptoms and imaging suggestive of atelectasis, which is the collapse of lung tissue. This condition leads to a decrease in the number of alveoli that are ventilated, resulting in a ventilation-perfusion mismatch. The arterial blood gas analysis shows a low PaO2, indicating hypoxemia, while the PaCO2 is normal, suggesting that the primary issue is with oxygenation rather than ventilation. The decreased breath sounds and decreased fremitus at the lung bases further support the presence of atelectasis. Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's hypoxemia is a decreased ratio of ventilated alveoli due to the collapse of lung tissue.",9
6689,"The patient presents with symptoms of urinary incontinence that have worsened recently, along with signs of a urinary tract infection (UTI), as indicated by suprapubic tenderness, fever, and urinalysis showing pyuria, positive nitrites, and leukocyte esterase. The best next step is to confirm the diagnosis of a UTI and identify the causative organism to guide appropriate antibiotic therapy. A urine culture is the standard method for this purpose.",9
6695,"The patient is experiencing involuntary loss of urine without the urge to urinate, which suggests overflow incontinence. This type of incontinence can occur when the bladder is overdistended and unable to empty properly. The distended and tender abdomen, along with a uterus extending to the umbilicus, indicates that the bladder may be overfilled. The history of prolonged labor and epidural analgesia can contribute to bladder atony or decreased sensation, leading to urinary retention. Inadequate intermittent catheterization after delivery could result in bladder overdistension and overflow incontinence. The absence of urge and the nature of the incontinence make a current UTI or nerve damage less likely. Recurrent UTIs are not directly related to the immediate postpartum urinary retention. Therefore, the most likely cause is inadequate intermittent catheterization leading to overflow incontinence.",9
6701,"The clinical presentation suggests metastatic prostate cancer, given the back pain, neurological symptoms, and imaging findings of sclerotic bone lesions. The biopsy confirms prostate cancer. In prostate cancer, especially when it is advanced, perineural invasion is a common histological finding. This refers to cancer cells invading the space surrounding nerves within the prostate, which is associated with more aggressive disease and can contribute to the spread of cancer. Other options like prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (A) are precursors to cancer, fat invasion (C) is more related to advanced local invasion, and small, closely-packed, well-formed glands (D) describe benign prostatic hyperplasia rather than cancer.",9
6703,"The woman is experiencing sexual fantasies about female coworkers, which suggests an attraction to the same sex. However, she makes derogatory comments about same-sex couples in public. This behavior is indicative of reaction formation, a defense mechanism where an individual expresses the opposite of their unacceptable thoughts or feelings. In this case, her derogatory comments serve to mask or counteract her own same-sex attractions.",9
6712,"The patient has an incidentally discovered lung nodule that is 8.5 mm in size. He is otherwise healthy, has never smoked, and has no symptoms. According to guidelines for the management of pulmonary nodules, nodules less than 8 mm are often monitored with serial imaging rather than immediate invasive procedures. However, this nodule is slightly larger than 8 mm, which may warrant further evaluation. A PET scan is a non-invasive method to assess metabolic activity and can help determine if the nodule is suspicious for malignancy. Biopsy or surgical excision would be more invasive and are typically reserved for nodules with higher suspicion of malignancy or after further non-invasive evaluation. Given the size and the patient's low-risk profile, a PET scan is the most appropriate next step to further evaluate the nodule.",9
6716,"The study involves parents rating their own children's social interaction skills before and after the intervention. Given that the parents were eager to participate and had positive expectations about the program, their ratings could be influenced by their beliefs and hopes for improvement. This is a classic example of observer bias, where the expectations of the observer (in this case, the parents) influence their assessment of the outcome. The enthusiastic comments from parents further suggest that their expectations might have affected their ratings, leading to inflated scores post-intervention.",9
6714,"The patient presents with confusion, lethargy, dry mucous membranes, and hypernatremia (serum sodium of 158 mEq/L), which are indicative of dehydration and possibly diabetes insipidus. He is on lithium, which is known to cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus by affecting the kidney's ability to respond to antidiuretic hormone (ADH). The elevated ADH level (8 pg/mL) suggests that the posterior pituitary and hypothalamus are functioning properly in terms of ADH production and release. However, the kidneys are not responding to the ADH, which is characteristic of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. In nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, the site of dysfunction is the collecting duct, where the kidney fails to respond to ADH, leading to an inability to concentrate urine and resulting in polyuria and hypernatremia.",9
6719,"The patient has a 12 mm induration from a PPD test, which is considered positive for someone who works in a high-risk setting like a prison. This indicates latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). The negative acid-fast smear suggests there is no active tuberculosis disease. For LTBI, the standard treatment is isoniazid for 9 months to prevent progression to active TB disease. Therefore, the recommended treatment for this patient is isoniazid for 9 months.",9
6730,"The patient's symptoms of increased thirst, frequent urination, and fatigue, along with his obesity (BMI of 35.4 kg/m2) and physical examination findings of increased adipose tissue over the back of the neck and hyperpigmentation of the axilla and inguinal folds, suggest insulin resistance and possible type 2 diabetes mellitus. The diagnostic criteria for diabetes include a fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg/dL or higher, a 2-hour plasma glucose level of 200 mg/dL or higher during an oral glucose tolerance test, an HbA1c of 6.5% or higher, or a random plasma glucose of 200 mg/dL or higher in a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia. Among the options, a plasma glucose of 209 mg/dL 2 hours after the oral glucose load meets the criteria for diabetes diagnosis.",9
6727,"The patient presents with bleeding after surgery, and the laboratory results show normal platelet count, normal bleeding time, normal PT, and normal aPTT. The history of a brother dying from a bleeding disorder suggests a possible hereditary condition. Aspirin, which affects platelet function, was stopped 7 days prior, so its effects should have worn off. The normal bleeding time and platelet count suggest that platelet dysfunction due to aspirin is unlikely. Factor VIII deficiency (hemophilia A) would cause an elevated aPTT, which is not present here. Liver dysfunction would typically affect PT and aPTT due to decreased synthesis of clotting factors, but these are normal. The severe oozing from the surgical site and the history of a bleeding disorder in the family suggest that the bleeding is due to insufficient mechanical hemostasis during surgery rather than a systemic coagulopathy.",9
6738,"The patient presents with symptoms and imaging findings suggestive of bronchiectasis, characterized by chronic productive cough and specific radiographic features like tram-track opacities. Nebulized N-acetylcysteine is used as a mucolytic agent in such conditions. It works by breaking disulfide bonds in mucus glycoproteins, reducing mucus viscosity and aiding in its clearance. This mechanism helps in managing the thick, viscous sputum associated with bronchiectasis.",9
6750,"The patient has atrial fibrillation, as indicated by the irregularly irregular pulse and absence of P waves on ECG. Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of thromboembolic events, such as stroke. To reduce this risk, anticoagulation therapy is often prescribed. The drug described inhibits the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade, which involves factor VII. Warfarin is a common anticoagulant that works by inhibiting the reduction of vitamin K, thereby preventing the activation of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, including factor VII. This inhibition reduces the risk of thromboembolic complications by decreasing the formation of blood clots.",9
6755,"The patient has a history of triple-negative breast cancer and underwent chemotherapy. She now presents with symptoms of heart failure, including shortness of breath, a displaced point of maximal impulse, and reduced ejection fraction on echocardiography. These findings suggest cardiomyopathy, which is a known adverse effect of certain chemotherapy agents. Anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin, are well-known for causing dose-dependent cardiotoxicity, leading to dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. This aligns with the patient's presentation of heart failure symptoms and reduced ejection fraction. Other chemotherapy agents, such as alkylating agents, antimetabolites, and topoisomerase I inhibitors, are not typically associated with this specific type of cardiotoxicity.",9
6754,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). She has joint pain, fatigue, skin lesions consistent with discoid lupus, oral ulcers, and a history of unprovoked deep vein thromboses, which could indicate antiphospholipid syndrome, often associated with SLE. In SLE, laboratory tests typically show positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA), and antiphospholipid syndrome can cause a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), not decreased. Positive rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test can occur due to antiphospholipid antibodies, but it is not specific for SLE. Anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies are associated with rheumatoid arthritis, not SLE. Therefore, the most likely laboratory finding in this patient with suspected SLE is a positive rapid plasma reagin test due to antiphospholipid antibodies.",9
6757,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest iron deficiency anemia. The key clues are the small, pale red blood cells (microcytic, hypochromic anemia) and the patient's age and gender, which make gastrointestinal blood loss a likely cause. In postmenopausal women, chronic blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract is a common cause of iron deficiency anemia. A positive stool guaiac test would indicate the presence of occult blood in the stool, supporting gastrointestinal bleeding as the source of iron deficiency.",9
6761,"The patient presents with chest tightness, shortness of breath, and lightheadedness, which are symptoms suggestive of angina or cardiac-related issues. The symptoms occur with exertion and improve with rest, indicating a possible cardiac origin. The key finding on examination is a late systolic ejection murmur best heard in the third right intercostal space, which is suggestive of aortic stenosis. Aortic stenosis can lead to increased left ventricular pressure and workload, resulting in increased oxygen demand by the left ventricle. This increased demand, especially during exertion, can lead to symptoms of angina due to insufficient oxygen supply to the heart muscle. Therefore, the most likely mechanism for her symptoms is increased left ventricular oxygen demand due to aortic stenosis.",9
6760,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are suggestive of endometriosis. She has painful defecation, pain with micturition, and dyspareunia (pain during sexual intercourse), which are common symptoms of endometriosis. The severe lower abdominal cramps that persist after menstruation and the heavy menstrual bleeding also align with endometriosis. The physical examination reveals a tender retroverted uterus, a left adnexal mass, and nodules on rectovaginal examination, which are indicative of endometriotic implants. These findings, combined with her infertility issues, strongly suggest endometriosis as the most likely diagnosis.",9
6772,"The patient presents with progressive weakness in her arms and legs, difficulty swallowing, and holding her head up, along with pooling of oral secretions. The examination reveals decreased muscle strength and tone in the upper extremities, with asymmetric deep tendon reflexes: decreased on the right side and increased on the left side. Sensation is intact. These findings suggest both upper and lower motor neuron involvement. The combination of upper motor neuron signs (increased reflexes on the left side) and lower motor neuron signs (decreased muscle strength and tone) is characteristic of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Guillain-Barré syndrome typically presents with ascending weakness and areflexia, Myasthenia gravis presents with fluctuating muscle weakness without changes in reflexes, and Spinal muscular atrophy involves lower motor neuron signs without upper motor neuron involvement. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is ALS.",9
6780,"The patient's symptoms include fatigue, abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and steatorrhea (as indicated by the Sudan III stain showing fat in the stool). These symptoms are suggestive of malabsorption. Celiac disease is a common cause of malabsorption and is characterized by an immune reaction to gluten, leading to damage in the small intestine and resulting in symptoms like diarrhea, weight loss, and steatorrhea. Ulcerative colitis typically presents with bloody diarrhea and does not usually cause steatorrhea. Carcinoid syndrome involves flushing, diarrhea, and wheezing, but not steatorrhea. Lactose intolerance causes diarrhea and abdominal pain but not steatorrhea. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is celiac disease.",9
6778,"The patient initially presented with symptoms suggestive of depression, including fatigue, hypersomnia, weight gain, and a dysphoric affect. Given her history of adverse reactions to SSRIs (paroxetine and escitalopram), the physician likely chose a different class of antidepressant. The patient's subsequent presentation with severe headache, agitation, hyperthermia, and hypertension is indicative of a hypertensive crisis, which is a known side effect of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) when dietary restrictions are not followed. MAOIs work by inhibiting the degradation of monoamines (such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine) by blocking the enzyme monoamine oxidase. This mechanism can lead to hypertensive crisis if tyramine-containing foods (like certain cheeses and wines) are consumed. Therefore, the medication responsible for her symptoms likely works through inhibition of amine degradation.",9
6783,"The patient has chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 and has not achieved a sustained viral response with pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin. For genotype 1, direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are more effective. Simeprevir is a protease inhibitor that is used in combination with other medications to treat hepatitis C genotype 1. Emtricitabine, telbivudine, and tenofovir are used for hepatitis B or HIV, not hepatitis C. Therefore, adding Simeprevir to the regimen would most likely benefit this patient.",9
6793,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a bowel obstruction, such as abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, and vomiting. The physical exam findings of hypoactive bowel sounds, abdominal distension, and diffuse tenderness support this diagnosis. In cases of suspected bowel obstruction, the initial management involves decompressing the bowel and stabilizing the patient. This is typically done by placing a nasogastric tube to relieve pressure and prevent further vomiting, keeping the patient NPO (nothing by mouth) to rest the bowel, and administering IV fluids to maintain hydration and electrolyte balance. Emergency surgery is reserved for cases with signs of bowel ischemia, perforation, or if conservative management fails. IV antibiotics and steroids are not indicated without signs of infection or inflammation like in diverticulitis or inflammatory bowel disease. Stool guaiac is not relevant in the acute management of bowel obstruction.",9
6794,"The patient's symptoms and EKG findings are key to identifying the condition. He presents with palpitations after consuming a significant amount of alcohol, which is a known trigger for atrial fibrillation, often referred to as ""holiday heart syndrome."" The EKG shows absent P waves and an irregularly irregular rhythm, which are classic signs of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is characterized by disorganized atrial electrical activity leading to irregular ventricular response. The other options do not match the EKG findings: a transmural myocardial infarction would show ST elevation, torsades de pointes would show a specific polymorphic ventricular tachycardia pattern, and ventricular hypertrophy would not typically cause absent P waves and an irregularly irregular rhythm.",9
6799,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with type 2 diabetes mellitus, including frequent urination, increased thirst and hunger, elevated blood glucose, and elevated hemoglobin A1c. The presence of microalbuminuria suggests early diabetic nephropathy. In diabetic nephropathy, the initial cause of proteinuria is due to increased glomerular filtration pressure and hyperfiltration, which leads to damage of the glomerular filtration barrier. Over time, this can progress to more advanced changes such as nodular glomerulosclerosis (Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules), but the early stage is characterized by increased glomerular filtration.",9
6797,"The boy's symptoms and history suggest rheumatic fever, which is a complication of a streptococcal throat infection. The presence of a sore throat followed by joint pain, subcutaneous nodules, and a heart murmur (indicative of mitral valve involvement) aligns with this diagnosis. Rheumatic fever is caused by a type II hypersensitivity reaction, where antibodies produced against streptococcal antigens cross-react with host tissues, such as the heart, joints, and skin. The elevated antistreptolysin O titer supports a recent streptococcal infection. Therefore, the mechanism behind his symptoms is a type II hypersensitivity reaction.",9
6798,"The patient presents with hematuria, fever, rash, and bilateral flank pain. The urinalysis shows numerous eosinophils, which is a key finding. These symptoms and laboratory findings are suggestive of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN), often caused by a hypersensitivity reaction to medications such as NSAIDs, antibiotics, or other drugs. The presence of eosinophils in the urine is particularly indicative of ATIN. The absence of RBC casts makes acute glomerulonephritis less likely. Renal cell carcinoma typically presents with hematuria but not with eosinophils or systemic symptoms like fever and rash. Acute tubular necrosis is characterized by muddy brown casts and is usually associated with ischemic or toxic injury, not eosinophils or rash.",9
6800,"The patient presents with intermittent dysphagia, particularly with solid foods, which suggests a structural abnormality in the esophagus. The endoscopic image of the lower esophagus is likely showing an esophageal stricture or a Schatzki ring, which are common causes of intermittent dysphagia in adults. Given the history of food impaction and the endoscopic findings, the most appropriate next step in management is to relieve the obstruction. Endoscopic dilation is a common and effective treatment for esophageal strictures or Schatzki rings, which aligns with the patient's symptoms and the likely findings on endoscopy.",9
6802,"When an action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal of a motor neuron at the neuromuscular junction, it causes depolarization of the presynaptic membrane. This depolarization opens voltage-gated calcium channels, allowing calcium ions to enter the neuron. The influx of calcium ions into the presynaptic terminal increases the cytosolic concentration of Ca2+. This increase in calcium concentration is crucial for triggering the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitters. Specifically, the calcium ions facilitate the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane, leading to the release of acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft. Therefore, the correct event that occurs as a result of increased cytosolic Ca2+ is the exocytosis of acetylcholine from the synaptic vesicles.",9
6812,"The patient presents with a classic triad of symptoms: urinary incontinence, cognitive dysfunction, and gait disturbance. These symptoms are suggestive of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). In NPH, the urinary incontinence is typically due to an inability to suppress voiding, which is a result of frontal lobe dysfunction affecting the micturition reflex. This leads to urgency and incontinence because the patient cannot inhibit the bladder contraction. The gait disturbance and cognitive issues further support the diagnosis of NPH, where the ventricles are enlarged, but the pressure is normal, affecting brain function.",9
6822,"The patient is HIV-positive with a CD4+ count of 700/m3, which is within the normal range (≥ 500/mm3). He has a history of IV drug use, which is a risk factor for tuberculosis (TB). However, his tuberculin skin test (TST) shows an induration of only 3 mm, which is considered negative for TB in individuals with a normal immune response. In HIV-positive patients with a CD4+ count ≥ 500/mm3, the cutoff for a positive TST is typically 5 mm. Since his TST is negative and he has no symptoms suggestive of active TB, reassurance is appropriate. There is no need for further testing or treatment at this time.",9
6825,"The patient presents with flank pain, hematuria, rash, and acute kidney injury (elevated creatinine). These symptoms, along with the recent use of a proton pump inhibitor (pantoprazole), suggest acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). AIN is often associated with drug reactions and can present with a triad of fever, rash, and eosinophilia. Although eosinophilia is not mentioned in the blood work, eosinophils can be found in the urine in cases of AIN. The other options do not fit the presentation: papillary calcifications are associated with analgesic nephropathy, urinary crystals are seen in conditions like ethylene glycol poisoning or uric acid nephropathy, and crescentic proliferation is seen in rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.",9
6828,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a pulmonary embolism (PE), likely due to a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following her recent travel. The dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia, hypoxemia, and unilateral leg swelling are classic signs. Jugular venous distention and decreased breath sounds further support this. In pregnancy, the risk of DVT and subsequent PE is increased. The most direct test to confirm a DVT, which could lead to a PE, is a compression ultrasound of the leg veins. A noncompressible femoral vein on ultrasonography would indicate the presence of a thrombus, confirming DVT.",9
6834,"The patient has a history of asthma and aspirin allergy, which suggests a sensitivity to NSAIDs. She received ketorolac, an NSAID, postoperatively. Her symptoms of chest tightness, shortness of breath, wheezing, and facial flushing are consistent with a reaction to NSAIDs in individuals with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). This is not a true IgE-mediated allergic reaction (Type 1 hypersensitivity) but rather a pseudoallergic reaction due to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) leading to increased leukotriene production, which causes bronchoconstriction and other symptoms. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of her symptoms is a pseudoallergic reaction.",9
6833,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs of hypertensive emergency, including severe hypertension, papilledema, and renal involvement (elevated creatinine and proteinuria). The ophthalmoscopic finding of arteriolar nicking and papilledema suggests chronic hypertension leading to changes in the retinal vessels. In chronic hypertension, the increased pressure leads to adaptive changes in the blood vessels, including smooth muscle hyperplasia and duplication of the basement membrane, which is characteristic of hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis. This is the pathophysiological process responsible for the neovascular changes in this patient.",9
6845,"The patient has a gastric ulcer and a positive test for Helicobacter pylori, which is a common cause of peptic ulcers. While antibiotic therapy will address the H. pylori infection, other factors can contribute to ulcer recurrence. The patient is a smoker, and smoking is known to impair ulcer healing and increase the risk of recurrence. Therefore, smoking cessation would be the most effective lifestyle modification to decrease the recurrence of his symptoms. Celecoxib is a COX-2 inhibitor and less likely to cause gastric ulcers compared to non-selective NSAIDs, but the patient is not currently taking NSAIDs. Increasing milk consumption and a low-fat diet are not directly related to ulcer recurrence prevention.",9
6849,"The patient presents with macrocytic anemia (MCV 110 μm3) and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy (tingling in feet and hands). The low corrected reticulocyte index suggests a decreased production of red blood cells. The combination of macrocytic anemia and peripheral neuropathy is suggestive of vitamin B12 deficiency, which leads to impaired DNA synthesis in red blood cells. This is because vitamin B12 is crucial for DNA synthesis, and its deficiency results in ineffective erythropoiesis and the production of large, immature red blood cells (megaloblasts).",9
6846,"The symptoms described in the newborn, such as heavy and rapid breathing, irritability, pale skin, profuse sweating, cold feet, and diminished lower extremity pulses, along with a harsh systolic murmur, suggest a condition related to poor systemic circulation. The absence of cyanosis and the diminished lower extremity pulses are indicative of a condition like coarctation of the aorta, where there is narrowing of the aorta leading to reduced blood flow to the lower body. In newborns, maintaining ductal patency with prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) can help improve systemic circulation by allowing blood to bypass the narrowed section of the aorta through the ductus arteriosus. This is a common treatment for ductal-dependent congenital heart defects.",9
6856,"The patient is described as being in Tanner stage 4 for breast, genitalia, and pubic hair development. In Tanner stage 4, the breast development is characterized by the formation of a secondary mound (raised areola) above the level of the breast. The pubic hair is adult-like in appearance but does not yet extend to the medial thigh. Therefore, the expected findings for Tanner stage 4 would include a raised areola for breast development and adult-like pubic hair that does not extend to the medial thigh.",9
6861,"The patient presents with right hip pain that is exacerbated by walking up and down stairs. On examination, there is tenderness at the anteromedial part of the tibial plateau, which is consistent with the location of the pes anserine bursa. The lack of tenderness elsewhere in the knee, along with a negative McMurray's test, suggests that a meniscal tear is unlikely. Prepatellar bursitis would present with tenderness and swelling over the patella, which is not described here. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis given the location of tenderness and the patient's symptoms is pes anserine bursitis.",9
6872,"The patient's symptoms and clinical findings are suggestive of acute cholecystitis. She has right upper quadrant pain that radiates to the right shoulder, fever, and a positive Murphy's sign (pauses during inspiration upon deep palpation of the right upper quadrant). Her laboratory findings show mild leukocytosis and elevated bilirubin levels, which can be associated with gallbladder inflammation or obstruction. The patient's obesity (BMI of 35 kg/m2) and female gender are risk factors for gallstones, which are a common cause of cholecystitis. A history of multiple past pregnancies (option A) is also a risk factor for gallstones due to hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy, which can lead to increased cholesterol saturation in bile. Therefore, further evaluation is most likely to reveal a history of multiple past pregnancies.",9
6870,"The patient has been experiencing feelings of sadness most days for about 2 to 3 years, along with symptoms such as poor sleep, difficulty concentrating, guilt, and loss of appetite. These symptoms have been persistent and chronic, lasting for more than 2 years. This aligns with the criteria for Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD), which involves a chronic form of depression lasting for at least 2 years. Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) typically involves more severe symptoms that may not be as chronic. Bipolar Disorder involves episodes of mania or hypomania, which are not described here. Schizoaffective Disorder involves symptoms of schizophrenia along with mood disorder symptoms, which are also not present. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Persistent Depressive Disorder.",9
6877,"The microbiologist's hypothesis describes a situation where a new virion is formed with the genome of one virus (virus A) but with a coat that includes components from both viruses A and B. This scenario is indicative of phenotypic mixing, where the surface proteins (phenotype) of the virus are a mix of the proteins from two different viruses, but the genetic material remains unchanged. This is different from genetic reassortment or antigenic shift, which involve changes in the genetic material itself. Complementation involves one virus providing a functional protein that the other lacks, which is not the case here. Therefore, the phenomenon described is phenotypic mixing.",9
6883,"The patient was started on both unfractionated heparin and warfarin. Five days later, she developed thrombosis and a significant drop in platelet count. This is suggestive of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), particularly Type II HIT, which is an immune-mediated reaction that typically occurs 5-10 days after starting heparin. It is characterized by thrombocytopenia and paradoxical thrombosis. The normal PT and PTT, along with the timing and symptoms, support this diagnosis. Type I HIT is a non-immune reaction that occurs within the first 2 days of heparin exposure and is not associated with thrombosis. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) would not typically present with thrombosis, and warfarin toxicity would not cause thrombocytopenia or thrombosis in this context.",9
6878,"The clinical presentation of the child includes a swollen, tender, erythematous area on the leg with sharply defined borders, along with a narrow red line extending from the leg to the groin. This red line suggests lymphangitis, which is inflammation of the lymphatic channels. The presence of fever and the history of an insect bite further support an infectious process. Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus) is a common cause of cellulitis and lymphangitis, characterized by erythema with well-defined borders and systemic symptoms such as fever. Sporothrix schenckii typically causes nodular lesions along lymphatic channels but is less common and usually associated with gardening or handling plant material. Contact dermatitis would not cause fever or lymphangitis. Vasculitis would present differently, often with purpura or petechiae, and not with the described lymphangitis. Therefore, the most likely cause of these findings is a Streptococcus pyogenes infection.",9
6892,"The patient's symptoms and family history suggest a connective tissue disorder. The combination of lens dislocation, sensorineural hearing loss, and renal issues (hematuria) points towards Alport syndrome, a genetic condition affecting type IV collagen. Alport syndrome is characterized by progressive renal disease, hearing loss, and ocular abnormalities. The family history of renal failure and corneal dystrophy supports this diagnosis. A skin biopsy can be used to confirm Alport syndrome by demonstrating abnormalities in type IV collagen. Therefore, a skin biopsy is the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis.",9
6895,"The patient is at 26 weeks gestation and has been involved in a motor vehicle accident. The non-stress test is non-responsive, and the biophysical profile shows abnormalities, indicating fetal distress. The lecithin/sphingomyelin (L/S) ratio of 1.9 suggests that the fetal lungs are not mature, as a ratio of 2.0 or higher typically indicates maturity. Given the fetal distress and the immaturity of the lungs, the administration of corticosteroids like betamethasone is indicated to accelerate fetal lung maturity. This is the most appropriate next step to improve fetal outcomes in case of preterm delivery.",9
6890,"The patient's presentation is consistent with Bell's palsy, which is an acute, unilateral facial nerve (CN VII) paralysis. This condition typically presents with sudden onset of facial droop affecting both the upper and lower parts of the face on one side, as seen in this patient. The inability to close the eye and move the mouth on the affected side, along with the absence of other neurological deficits, supports this diagnosis. Bell's palsy is often idiopathic but is thought to be related to viral inflammation of the facial nerve. The standard treatment for Bell's palsy is corticosteroids, such as prednisone, which help reduce inflammation and improve recovery. Other options listed, such as head CT, gold weight implantation, and intravenous immunoglobulin, are not standard treatments for Bell's palsy. Therefore, the most appropriate intervention to address the likely cause of this patient's symptoms is prednisone alone.",9
6897,"The clinical presentation and findings suggest a mitochondrial disorder, specifically myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF). The key findings include myoclonus (involuntary muscle contractions), epilepsy, and the presence of ragged-red fibers on muscle biopsy. These symptoms are consistent with a defect in mitochondrial function, particularly oxidative phosphorylation. The presence of ragged-red fibers indicates abnormal mitochondria accumulating in the muscle fibers. The family history of cognitive disabilities and epilepsy in a sibling also supports a mitochondrial inheritance pattern. Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism is defective oxidative phosphorylation.",9
6901,"The patient's symptoms include periods of elevated mood with increased energy, creativity, and productivity, followed by periods of depression with low energy and hopelessness. These mood fluctuations have been occurring for 2 years without a period of feeling ""normal."" Cyclothymic disorder is characterized by chronic fluctuating mood disturbances involving numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms and depressive symptoms that do not meet the full criteria for a major depressive episode or hypomanic episode. The duration of symptoms (2 years) and the nature of the mood swings fit the criteria for cyclothymic disorder. Bipolar II disorder requires at least one hypomanic episode and one major depressive episode, which is not clearly described here. Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) involves chronic depression without the hypomanic symptoms described. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is cyclothymic disorder.",9
6902,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder, including insomnia, anxiety, irritability, loss of interest, and fatigue. She is particularly concerned about her insomnia and its impact on her daily functioning. Mirtazapine is an antidepressant that can help with depressive symptoms and is known for its sedative properties, which can improve sleep. Therefore, dose titration of mirtazapine is likely to address both her depressive symptoms and her sleep issues effectively.",9
6899,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a case of myocarditis, likely due to a viral infection. He had a recent 'cold' 2 weeks ago, which could have been a viral upper respiratory infection. The presence of a third heart sound, displaced point of maximal impact, and global hypokinesis with reduced ejection fraction on echocardiogram are indicative of heart failure, likely due to myocarditis. The ECG findings of premature ventricular complexes and widened QRS complexes support cardiac involvement. Coxsackievirus is a common cause of viral myocarditis, especially following a recent viral illness. Acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina are less likely given his age, lack of significant coronary risk factors, and the presentation following a viral illness. Cocaine abuse could cause similar symptoms, but there is no history of cocaine use, and the timeline fits better with a viral cause.",9
6898,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of diverticulitis, including left lower quadrant pain, fever, leukocytosis with a left shift, and heme-positive stool. In cases of suspected diverticulitis, an abdominal CT scan is the most useful diagnostic test. It can confirm the diagnosis by showing inflamed diverticula, assess the extent of the disease, and identify complications such as abscesses or perforation. Lipase is used to evaluate pancreatitis, which is unlikely given the location of the pain. Ultrasound is not typically used for diagnosing diverticulitis. Emergent colonoscopy is contraindicated in acute diverticulitis due to the risk of perforation.",9
6909,"The patient is on long-term prednisone therapy, which is a glucocorticoid. Chronic glucocorticoid use leads to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, resulting in decreased production of ACTH. Low ACTH levels cause atrophy of the adrenal glands because ACTH is a trophic hormone that stimulates adrenal growth and function. Since the suppression is systemic due to exogenous glucocorticoids, both adrenal glands will be affected, leading to bilateral adrenal atrophy.",9
6906,"The child in the scenario is 4 years old and has experienced a period of dryness followed by a recurrence of bedwetting. At this age, bedwetting is not uncommon, and the absence of daytime symptoms or other concerning signs suggests that this is likely a normal developmental phase. The child is developmentally appropriate for his age, as indicated by his ability to perform tasks such as naming colors, following commands, and playing well with peers. There are no signs of underlying medical or psychological issues. Therefore, the most appropriate management at this stage is reassurance, as bedwetting is common in children under 5 years old and often resolves with time.",9
6905,"The patient has an elevated INR, indicating increased anticoagulation effect of warfarin. Warfarin's effect can be increased by medications that inhibit its metabolism, leading to higher INR levels. The patient was treated for a painful red rash, which suggests a possible bacterial skin infection. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is an antibiotic that can be used for skin infections and is known to inhibit the metabolism of warfarin, thereby increasing INR. The other options, such as rifampin and phenobarbital, are enzyme inducers that would decrease INR, and griseofulvin is not typically used for bacterial skin infections and does not have a significant interaction with warfarin to increase INR.",9
6920,"The patient presents with symptoms and synovial fluid analysis consistent with septic arthritis. The Gram stain of the synovial fluid shows gram-negative rods, suggesting a gram-negative bacterial infection. In cases of gram-negative septic arthritis, broad-spectrum antibiotics that cover gram-negative organisms are required. 

IV nafcillin (A) and IV vancomycin (D) are primarily used for gram-positive organisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus, and are not appropriate for gram-negative infections.

IV cefepime (B) is a fourth-generation cephalosporin with broad-spectrum activity, including coverage for gram-negative organisms, making it a suitable choice for this case.

IV ceftazidime and gentamicin (C) also cover gram-negative organisms, but the combination is typically used for more severe infections or when Pseudomonas aeruginosa is suspected. Given the lack of specific indication for Pseudomonas and the broad coverage of cefepime, cefepime alone is a more appropriate initial choice.

Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is IV cefepime.",9
6922,"The patient is a teenager with difficulty falling asleep at a conventional bedtime (11 p.m.) and instead feels sleepy around 2 a.m. He does not have issues with waking up during the night, but struggles to wake up early for school and experiences daytime sleepiness. On weekends, he naturally falls asleep around 2 a.m. and wakes up at 10 a.m., feeling rested. This pattern suggests a misalignment between his internal circadian rhythm and the societal demands of his schedule. Delayed sleep-wake disorder is characterized by a delay in the sleep-wake cycle, leading to late sleep onset and difficulty waking up at a desired time, which fits this patient's symptoms. Psychophysiologic insomnia involves difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep due to conditioned arousal, which is not the case here. Advanced sleep-wake disorder involves early sleep onset and early morning awakening, which does not match this patient's pattern. Irregular sleep-wake disorder involves a lack of a clear sleep-wake pattern, which is also not the case here. Therefore, the most likely explanation is delayed sleep-wake disorder.",9
6940,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease). Key findings include hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, low blood glucose, and low cortisol levels that do not respond to ACTH stimulation. The presence of hyperpigmentation (darkened palmar creases) and a history of autoimmune disease (alopecia areata) further support this diagnosis. Primary adrenal insufficiency is most commonly caused by autoimmune destruction of the adrenal glands, especially in the context of other autoimmune conditions. The lack of response to ACTH stimulation confirms that the problem is at the level of the adrenal glands, not the pituitary. Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism is autoimmune destruction of the adrenal gland.",9
6942,"The patient is experiencing involuntary movements such as grimacing and lip-smacking. These symptoms are characteristic of tardive dyskinesia, a condition often associated with long-term use of antipsychotic medications. Although clozapine is less likely to cause tardive dyskinesia compared to other antipsychotics, it is still a possibility. Torticollis involves abnormal neck positioning, oculogyric crisis involves eye movements, and Tourette’s syndrome involves vocal and motor tics, none of which match the patient's symptoms.",9
6944,"The patient is experiencing symptoms consistent with organophosphate poisoning, specifically from malathion, which is an organophosphate insecticide. Organophosphates inhibit acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme responsible for breaking down acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft. This inhibition leads to an accumulation of acetylcholine, causing overstimulation of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, resulting in the symptoms observed (e.g., salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal distress, and emesis, collectively known as SLUDGE symptoms, along with bradycardia and hypotension). 

Organophosphates like malathion cause irreversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by forming a covalent bond with the enzyme. This is a key characteristic of organophosphate poisoning, distinguishing it from reversible inhibitors. 

Option A is incorrect because the inhibition is irreversible, not reversible. 
Option B is incorrect because irreversible inhibition typically decreases Vmax, as the enzyme is permanently inactivated. 
Option D is incorrect because malathion does not activate the enzyme; it inhibits it by binding covalently to the active site, not an allosteric site.

Therefore, the correct statement is that the patient’s symptoms result from the formation of covalent bonds between malathion and the affected enzyme.",9
6948,"The patient's symptoms and findings are suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis, likely due to amiodarone use. The dry cough, shortness of breath, clubbing of the fingers, and inspiratory crackles are consistent with interstitial lung disease. The CT scan findings of clustered air spaces and reticular opacities in the lung bases further support this diagnosis. Amiodarone is known to cause pulmonary fibrosis as a side effect. Pulmonary fibrosis involves excess collagen deposition in the extracellular matrix of the lung, leading to restrictive lung disease and decreased vital capacity, which explains the patient's dyspnea.",9
6957,"The patient is likely suffering from Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which is associated with thiamine deficiency, often due to chronic alcohol abuse. Wernicke's encephalopathy, the acute phase, is characterized by confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia, which can improve with thiamine treatment. Korsakoff syndrome, the chronic phase, involves anterograde amnesia and confabulation, which are less responsive to thiamine treatment. Therefore, while confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia may improve with thiamine, anterograde amnesia typically does not.",9
6976,"The patient's symptoms and findings are suggestive of carcinoid syndrome, which is caused by a neuroendocrine tumor that secretes serotonin and other vasoactive substances. The elevated urine 5-HIAA confirms increased serotonin metabolism. The flushing, diarrhea, and cardiac involvement (tricuspid insufficiency) are classic for carcinoid syndrome. Octreotide, a somatostatin analog, is effective in managing symptoms by inhibiting the release of serotonin and other hormones from the tumor. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to administer octreotide.",9
6960,"The clinical presentation suggests a primary immunodeficiency. The key features include recurrent infections, delayed umbilical cord separation, and leukocytosis with neutrophilia. The delayed separation of the umbilical cord and the high neutrophil count suggest a problem with neutrophil function, specifically in adhesion and migration. This is characteristic of Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency (LAD), which is caused by a defect in the beta-2 integrin (CD18). The recurrent infections and poor wound healing are consistent with this diagnosis. Other options like defective IL-2R gamma chain, NADPH oxidase, and WAS gene mutation do not match the specific symptoms of delayed cord separation and neutrophilia.",9
6979,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), specifically emphysema. The barrel-chested appearance and pursed-lip breathing are characteristic of emphysema. The spirometry results showing decreased FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC ratio are indicative of an obstructive lung disease. Given the patient's significant smoking history, the type of emphysema most commonly associated with smoking is centriacinar emphysema, which predominantly affects the upper lobes of the lungs.",10
6981,"The patient's symptoms suggest a hypertensive crisis, which can occur when someone taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) consumes tyramine-rich foods. The combination of red wine, salami, and dried fruits is high in tyramine. MAOIs, such as phenelzine, inhibit the breakdown of tyramine, leading to increased levels that can cause a hypertensive crisis. The patient's symptoms of severe headache, chest tightness, and high blood pressure align with this condition. Sertraline is an SSRI, sumatriptan is a migraine medication, and topiramate is an anticonvulsant used for migraine prevention, none of which are associated with tyramine-induced hypertensive crises. Therefore, the medication causing the side effect is phenelzine.",9
6988,"The infant is 15 days old and has been exclusively breastfed. The mother reports frequent feeding, but the infant's weight gain is not adequate. The infant's birth weight was 2787 g, and at 15 days, the infant weighs 2720 g, which is still below the birth weight. Normally, infants should regain their birth weight by 10-14 days of life. The infant is also having fewer wet diapers than expected for her age, indicating possible inadequate intake. The mother reports that her breasts sometimes feel not completely empty after feeding, which could suggest ineffective feeding or latch issues. Observing a feeding can help assess the latch and effectiveness of breastfeeding, which is crucial before considering supplementation or other interventions.",9
6996,"The patient's symptoms include social isolation, odd behavior, and unusual beliefs (such as the belief in a ""sixth sense"" supported by crystals). She also exhibits eccentric appearance and behavior (wearing a long, black, hooded cloak) and has poor social interactions. These features are characteristic of schizotypal personality disorder, which involves odd beliefs, eccentric behavior, and discomfort in close relationships. Social anxiety disorder primarily involves fear of social situations, but does not typically include eccentric behavior or odd beliefs. Paranoid personality disorder involves pervasive distrust and suspicion, which is not the primary feature here. Schizophrenia would involve more severe symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions, which are not described in this case.",9
6991,"The patient presents with signs of respiratory distress and hypotension following a stab wound to the chest. The dullness to percussion on the left side suggests a hemothorax, which is confirmed by the chest X-ray. In cases of traumatic hemothorax, the immediate management step is to evacuate the blood from the pleural space to improve respiratory function and prevent further complications. The most appropriate and immediate intervention is chest tube insertion to drain the blood and re-expand the lung. This will also help stabilize the patient's hemodynamics.",9
7005,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of type 2 diabetes mellitus, including fatigue, increased urination, thirst, blurred vision, and elevated blood glucose and HbA1c levels. The presence of protein in the urine indicates possible diabetic nephropathy, which is a microvascular complication of diabetes. An ACE inhibitor is recommended for patients with diabetes and microalbuminuria or proteinuria to help protect kidney function and manage hypertension. The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and an ACE inhibitor would address both hypertension and renal protection. Insulin therapy is not immediately necessary given the HbA1c level, and lifestyle modifications such as diet changes are important but not the most immediate step for renal protection. Aspirin therapy is not indicated at this point without a history of cardiovascular disease.",9
6999,"The patient presents with fatigue, shortness of breath, and pale conjunctivae, indicating anemia. The laboratory findings show a low hematocrit, elevated LDH, low haptoglobin, and elevated bilirubin, which are indicative of hemolytic anemia. The peripheral blood smear is not provided, but given the context, it likely shows schistocytes, which are fragmented red blood cells. The presence of a heart murmur and the recent history of an upper respiratory infection treated with antibiotics suggest a possible drug-induced hemolytic anemia or mechanical hemolysis. However, the key finding here is the late systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur at the right upper sternal border, which is characteristic of aortic stenosis. Aortic stenosis can lead to mechanical destruction of erythrocytes as they pass through the narrowed valve, causing microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's anemia is mechanical destruction of erythrocytes due to aortic stenosis.",9
7008,"The scenario describes a knee injury with a popping sound, severe pain, swelling, and tenderness on the medial aspect of the knee. The mechanism of injury involves a lateral tackle, which often causes a valgus force on the knee. The symptoms of sharp pain and a locking sensation during external rotation suggest a meniscal injury. The medial tenderness and the mechanism of injury (valgus force) are consistent with a medial meniscus tear. Lateral meniscus tears are less likely to cause medial tenderness. ACL injuries often involve instability rather than locking, and PCL injuries are less common in this context.",9
7010,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN 2B). The key features include the thyroid nodule with Congo red staining, indicating medullary thyroid carcinoma, and the marfanoid habitus (tall stature, long fingers). MEN 2B is associated with medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytomas, and mucosal neuromas. Oral tumors, specifically mucosal neuromas, are characteristic of MEN 2B. Therefore, the additional finding most likely in this patient is oral tumors.",10

7012,"The clinical presentation of the 2-week-old boy, including muscle spasms, difficulty sucking, hypertonia, and opisthotonos (hyperextension of the neck and spine), along with a foul-smelling umbilical stump, suggests neonatal tetanus. This condition is caused by the bacterium Clostridium tetani, which produces a toxin known as tetanospasmin. Tetanospasmin acts by blocking the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters, specifically GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) and glycine, in the central nervous system. This blockade leads to unopposed excitatory neurotransmitter activity, resulting in the characteristic muscle spasms and rigidity seen in tetanus. Therefore, the function of the toxin responsible for this condition is blocking the release of GABA and glycine.",9
7024,"The patient has an acute infarction in the distribution of the left posterior cerebral artery (PCA). The PCA supplies the occipital lobe, the inferior part of the temporal lobe, and parts of the thalamus. A common result of PCA infarction is a contralateral homonymous hemianopia due to damage to the primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe. Since the infarction is on the left side, it would affect the right visual field of both eyes, leading to right-sided homonymous hemianopia. Prosopagnosia (C) is associated with damage to the fusiform gyrus, which is not specifically indicated here. Left-sided gaze deviation (B) is more associated with frontal lobe lesions. Right-sided superior quadrantanopia (D) would be due to damage to the temporal lobe's optic radiations, which is not the primary issue here.",9
7018,"The patient is suspected of ingesting antifreeze, which contains ethylene glycol. Ethylene glycol is metabolized to glycolic acid and oxalic acid, leading to an increased anion gap metabolic acidosis. The clinical presentation of unresponsiveness and the presence of a suicide note suggest a significant ingestion. The respiratory rate of 25/min indicates a compensatory response to metabolic acidosis, as the body attempts to blow off CO2 to counteract the acidemia. Therefore, the blood gas analysis is expected to show an anion gap metabolic acidosis.",9
7017,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest Lyme disease, which is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, a spiral-shaped bacterium. She has a history of a rash, likely erythema migrans, and recurrent joint swelling, which are characteristic of Lyme disease. She lives in Pennsylvania, an area endemic for Lyme disease, and works as a forest ranger, increasing her exposure risk to ticks that transmit the disease. The synovial fluid analysis shows a high leukocyte count with neutrophil predominance, consistent with inflammatory arthritis, but the Gram stain does not show organisms, which is typical for Lyme arthritis as Borrelia burgdorferi is not easily visualized on Gram stain.",9
7032,"The patient initially presented with symptoms suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction (MI), as indicated by the chest pain radiating to the jaw, nausea, vomiting, and elevated cardiac enzymes. He was appropriately treated and admitted. On day 5, he developed sudden breathlessness, hypotension, and bibasilar crackles, which are signs of acute heart failure and pulmonary edema. The high-pitched holosystolic murmur at the apex suggests acute mitral regurgitation. In the context of a recent MI, this is most likely due to papillary muscle rupture, which can occur as a complication of an MI, particularly when the infarction involves the inferior wall of the heart supplied by the right coronary artery. This rupture leads to acute mitral regurgitation, causing blood to flow back into the left atrium during systole, leading to pulmonary congestion and the observed clinical deterioration.",9
7033,"The virus loses infectivity when treated with a nonionic detergent, indicating that it is an enveloped virus. Nonionic detergents disrupt lipid membranes, so the virus must have a lipid envelope. Among the options, Herpesvirus and Togavirus are enveloped, while Adenovirus and Calicivirus are non-enveloped. 

The genetic material was treated with DNase, which degrades DNA. However, the virus was still able to produce viral particles after this treatment, suggesting that the genetic material is RNA, as DNase would not affect RNA. 

Therefore, the virus must be an enveloped RNA virus. Among the options, Togavirus is the only enveloped RNA virus. Herpesvirus is an enveloped DNA virus, Adenovirus is a non-enveloped DNA virus, and Calicivirus is a non-enveloped RNA virus.",10
7036,"The patient is experiencing a severe asthma exacerbation, as indicated by his initial low oxygen saturation, high respiratory rate, and minimal air movement on exam. The initial blood gas shows a respiratory alkalosis with a low PaCO2, which is common in asthma exacerbations due to hyperventilation. However, after treatment, the repeat blood gas shows normalization of the pH and PaCO2, indicating that the patient is tiring and retaining CO2, which is a sign of impending respiratory failure. The PaO2 is still low, and the patient is not improving significantly with current management. In such cases, where there is a risk of respiratory failure, intubation is indicated to secure the airway and provide adequate ventilation.",9
7040,"The patient presents with symptoms and physical exam findings suggestive of chronic bronchitis, a form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Key features include a chronic productive cough, exposure to second-hand smoke, and physical findings such as wheezing, cyanosis (blue tint to lips), and a barrel chest. In COPD, particularly chronic bronchitis, pulmonary function tests typically show an obstructive pattern. This includes a decreased FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second), a decreased FEV1/FVC (forced vital capacity) ratio due to airflow limitation, and an increased total lung capacity (TLC) due to air trapping. The diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is usually normal in chronic bronchitis, as opposed to emphysema where it is decreased due to alveolar destruction. Therefore, the expected pulmonary function test results for this patient would be decreased FEV1, decreased FEV1/FVC ratio, increased TLC, and normal DLCO.",9
7037,"In newborns, maternal antibodies can cross the placenta and be present in the infant's circulation, which can lead to a positive HIV antibody test even if the infant is not infected. Therefore, testing for HIV antibodies (option A) is not reliable for diagnosing HIV in newborns. The p24 antigen assay (option B) is less sensitive and specific in newborns. Viral culture (option C) is not commonly used due to its complexity and time requirements. The most appropriate test for diagnosing HIV in newborns is the PCR for HIV RNA (option D), as it detects the presence of the virus itself rather than antibodies, providing a direct indication of infection.",9
7044,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of an acute ischemic stroke, including facial droop, slurred speech, and unilateral weakness. These symptoms have been present for 2 hours, which is within the 4.5-hour window for thrombolytic therapy (IV tPA). However, before administering tPA, it is crucial to rule out hemorrhagic stroke, which is a contraindication for tPA. The fastest way to do this is with a CT scan of the head without contrast, which can quickly identify any intracranial hemorrhage. Therefore, the next most appropriate step is to perform a CT of the head without contrast to determine if the patient is a candidate for tPA.",9
7047,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with cellulitis, including fever, swelling, and redness of the leg. Fever is a systemic response to infection or inflammation, often mediated by cytokines and other chemical mediators. Among the options given, PGE2 (Prostaglandin E2) is known to play a significant role in the development of fever. It acts on the hypothalamus to raise the body's temperature set point, leading to fever. LTB4 is primarily involved in chemotaxis and inflammation, histamine is involved in vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, and arachidonic acid is a precursor to various eicosanoids but does not directly cause fever. Therefore, PGE2 is the most likely mediator responsible for the fever in this patient.",9
7042,"The patient's presentation is consistent with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). She has fever, malaise, nausea, and severe lower abdominal pain, which are common symptoms of PID. The physical examination reveals severe tenderness in the lower abdomen with guarding, uterine and adnexal tenderness, and cervical motion tenderness, all of which are indicative of PID. The presence of a purulent cervical discharge further supports this diagnosis. The negative pregnancy test rules out ectopic pregnancy, and the patient's sexual history with multiple partners increases the risk for sexually transmitted infections, which are common causes of PID. Vaginitis and cervicitis would not typically cause such severe systemic symptoms and abdominal pain, and a urinary tract infection would not explain the cervical motion tenderness and adnexal tenderness.",9
7048,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with urge incontinence, characterized by a sudden, intense urge to urinate followed by involuntary loss of urine. This is often due to overactivity of the detrusor muscle, which is responsible for bladder contractions. The absence of pelvic abnormalities, normal post-void residual, and negative Q-tip test further support that the issue is not related to stress incontinence or overflow incontinence. Her history of diabetes and caffeine intake can contribute to detrusor overactivity. Therefore, the primary underlying etiology is increased detrusor muscle activity.",9
7051,"The patient presents with microcytic anemia (MCV of 60 fL) and chronic fatigue. The laboratory findings show a low hemoglobin level, normal leukocyte and platelet counts, and a reticulocyte count that is slightly elevated. The key laboratory findings are the high free iron, low TIBC, and high ferritin levels, which are not consistent with iron deficiency anemia (which would show low iron, high TIBC, and low ferritin). B12 deficiency typically causes macrocytic anemia, not microcytic. Hemolytic anemia would present with signs of hemolysis such as elevated bilirubin and LDH, and decreased haptoglobin, which are not provided here. Beta-thalassemia is characterized by microcytic anemia with normal or elevated iron stores, which matches the patient's lab findings. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is beta-thalassemia.",9
7055,"The child's symptoms are characterized by recurrent episodes of severe nausea and vomiting, occurring in a cyclic pattern with symptom-free intervals. These episodes are not associated with any neurological symptoms such as changes in vision or gait disturbance, which makes an intracranial mass less likely. The normal physical exam and unremarkable initial tests also reduce the likelihood of an intracranial mass. Gastroesophageal reflux typically presents with more chronic symptoms rather than discrete episodes of vomiting. Intussusception usually presents with abdominal pain, ""currant jelly"" stools, and a palpable abdominal mass, none of which are described here. The family history of migraines is significant because cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is often associated with a family history of migraines. CVS is characterized by recurrent, stereotypical episodes of vomiting with symptom-free intervals, which matches this child's presentation. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is cyclic vomiting syndrome.",9
7052,"The child presents with a reducible midabdominal mass that becomes more prominent with increased intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., crying) and disappears when lying down. These characteristics are typical of an umbilical hernia, which is common in infants and young children. Most umbilical hernias in children are asymptomatic and tend to close spontaneously by the age of 3 to 5 years. Given the age of the child and the typical presentation, the most appropriate management is reassurance and observation, as surgical intervention is usually not necessary unless the hernia persists beyond early childhood or becomes symptomatic (e.g., incarceration or strangulation).",9
7053,"The patient presents with vaginal bleeding, severe lower back pain, and fetal distress at 35 weeks gestation. She has a history of cesarean section and myomectomy, which are risk factors for uterine rupture and placental abruption. The acute onset of symptoms, presence of contractions, and fetal distress suggest a significant obstetric complication. The large blood clots and delayed decelerations on fetal heart monitoring are indicative of placental abruption, which is the premature separation of a normally implanted placenta. This condition leads to bleeding and can cause fetal distress due to compromised blood supply. The history of cesarean section and myomectomy increases the risk of placental abruption due to potential uterine scarring. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is premature separation of a normally implanted placenta.",9
7059,"The patient is a 23-year-old pregnant woman presenting with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), confirmed by the presence of leukocytes, bacteria, and nitrates on a urine dipstick. In pregnant women, it is crucial to choose an antibiotic that is safe for both the mother and the developing fetus. Ciprofloxacin (B) and doxycycline (C) are contraindicated in pregnancy due to potential adverse effects on fetal development. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (D) is generally avoided in the first trimester due to potential teratogenic effects. Amoxicillin-clavulanate (A) is considered safe in pregnancy and is effective against common UTI pathogens. Therefore, the best treatment option for this pregnant patient is amoxicillin-clavulanate.",10
7074,"The patient presents with palpitations and an ECG showing sawtooth waves, indicative of atrial flutter. Ibutilide is used to convert atrial flutter to sinus rhythm. Ibutilide works by prolonging the action potential duration and refractory period, primarily through blocking potassium channels and activating the slow inward sodium current. This prolongation helps terminate reentrant circuits responsible for atrial flutter.",9
7065,"The patient's presentation suggests a hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome, given the family history of colorectal and endometrial cancers. The presence of a hemorrhagic mass in the colon and a positive stool occult blood test indicate a likely colorectal cancer. The family history is suggestive of Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer), which is associated with defects in DNA mismatch repair. Lynch syndrome is characterized by mutations in mismatch repair genes such as MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. These mutations lead to microsatellite instability and an increased risk of colorectal and other cancers. Therefore, the impaired process in this patient is mismatch repair.",9
7079,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), likely due to an infection given the fever and cough with sputum production. The increased anteroposterior diameter of the chest and history of smoking support the diagnosis of COPD. In this scenario, the best next step in management is to provide bronchodilation to relieve the airway obstruction. Muscarinic blockers (anticholinergics) such as ipratropium or tiotropium are commonly used in the management of COPD to provide bronchodilation. Therefore, the best next step in management is to administer a muscarinic blocker.",9
7076,"To determine the best conclusion, we need to consider the nature of correlation analysis and what it can tell us about the relationships between variables. Correlation analysis measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two continuous variables. It does not imply causation, so we can rule out any conclusions that suggest causation, such as option B.

Option A suggests that maternal BMI is a stronger predictor of childhood BMI than maternal HbA1c. This would require comparing the correlation coefficients of maternal BMI and maternal HbA1c with childhood BMI. However, without specific correlation values, we cannot determine which is stronger.

Option C discusses the slope of the association, which is not directly provided by correlation analysis. Correlation coefficients do not provide information about the slope of the relationship, only the strength and direction.

Option D states there is a positively correlated linear association between maternal BMI and childhood BMI. This is a general conclusion that can be drawn if the correlation coefficient between maternal BMI and childhood BMI is positive, indicating a positive linear relationship.

Without specific correlation values, the safest conclusion based on correlation analysis is the presence of a positive linear relationship, as stated in option D.",9
7077,"The scenario describes a situation where there was a mix-up regarding which hip was fractured and dislocated. The error occurred because the senior orthopedic resident noted the wrong side for the hip dislocation. To prevent such errors, a systematic approach to verify the surgical site is crucial. A preoperative time-out is a strategy where the surgical team pauses before the procedure to confirm the correct patient, procedure, and site. This practice is specifically designed to prevent wrong-site, wrong-procedure, and wrong-patient surgeries. While checklists, screening X-rays, and verifying patient identity are important, the preoperative time-out directly addresses the issue of confirming the correct surgical site, making it the most effective strategy in this context.",9
7083,"The patient presents with massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by the active rectal bleeding and the nasogastric tube draining bile without blood, suggesting the bleeding is not from the upper GI tract. The patient's hemodynamic instability and the estimated bleeding rate of 2-3 mL/min suggest a brisk bleed. In such cases, colonoscopy is often not feasible due to poor visualization from active bleeding. Exploratory laparotomy is invasive and typically reserved for cases where other diagnostic methods fail or the patient is unstable. EGD is not indicated as the NG tube shows no upper GI bleeding. Mesenteric angiography is appropriate for localizing and potentially treating active bleeding in the lower GI tract, especially when the bleeding rate is sufficient for angiographic detection.",9
7087,"The patient presents with signs of acute kidney injury (AKI), as evidenced by elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. The history of recent gastrointestinal illness with vomiting and diarrhea suggests significant fluid loss, leading to dehydration. His current symptoms of nausea, reduced urine output, dry mucous membranes, and hypotension (blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg) indicate hypovolemia. The elevated BUN and creatinine, along with the absence of abnormalities in urinalysis, support a prerenal cause of AKI, which is often due to decreased renal perfusion from hypovolemia. The use of ibuprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), can exacerbate this condition by reducing renal blood flow through inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, but the primary underlying cause here is the hypovolemia from fluid loss.",9
7092,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), including unilateral leg swelling, warmth, and pain on dorsiflexion (Homan's sign). His family history of pulmonary embolism in his father at a young age suggests a possible hereditary thrombophilia. Factor V Leiden is a common genetic mutation that increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, including DVT. The other options are related to bleeding disorders (von Willebrand disease, Vitamin K deficiency, Hemophilia A) and are not associated with increased clotting risk. Therefore, the most likely condition responsible for this presentation is Factor V Leiden.",9
7108,"The patient has an acute occlusion of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), which supplies the distal third of the transverse colon, the descending colon, the sigmoid colon, and the proximal part of the rectum. The rectosigmoid colon is primarily supplied by the IMA, making it the most likely area to be affected by an occlusion in this artery. The lower rectum is supplied by the middle and inferior rectal arteries, branches of the internal iliac artery, and thus would not be primarily affected by an IMA occlusion. The ascending colon is supplied by the superior mesenteric artery, and the transverse colon is supplied by both the superior mesenteric artery and the IMA, but the distal part of the transverse colon is less likely to be affected compared to the rectosigmoid colon in an IMA occlusion.",9
7113,"The patient presents with episodes of vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness, which are classic symptoms of Meniere's disease. The Weber test lateralizes to the left ear, indicating sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear, which is consistent with Meniere's disease. The Rinne test is positive bilaterally, indicating air conduction is better than bone conduction, which is normal or indicative of sensorineural hearing loss. Meniere's disease is caused by an imbalance in the production and resorption of endolymph, leading to endolymphatic hydrops. This matches the symptoms and test findings described in the vignette.",9
7114,"The patient is a young African American woman with sickle cell disease presenting with fever, chest pain, difficulty breathing, and hypoxia. These symptoms, along with her history, suggest acute chest syndrome, a common complication of sickle cell disease. Acute chest syndrome is characterized by a new pulmonary infiltrate on chest X-ray, fever, and respiratory symptoms. The best initial management includes antibiotics to cover possible infections (such as atypical bacteria and Streptococcus pneumoniae) and supportive care, which may include oxygen supplementation and pain management. Therefore, the best initial step is to start antibiotics and provide supportive care.",9
7120,"The patient has a history of head trauma followed by a lucid interval and then neurological deterioration, which is suggestive of an epidural hematoma. The symptoms of severe headache, nausea, and right leg weakness indicate increased intracranial pressure and possible herniation. The right leg weakness suggests compression of the left side of the brain, likely affecting the motor cortex. Subfalcine herniation, also known as cingulate herniation, occurs when brain tissue is displaced under the falx cerebri, often compressing the anterior cerebral artery and affecting the motor function of the contralateral leg. This matches the patient's right leg weakness. Tonsillar herniation would cause brainstem symptoms, uncal herniation would cause cranial nerve III palsy, and extracranial herniation is not a recognized type of herniation in this context.",9
7129,"The patient is a competitive runner with a low BMI and has been training heavily, which suggests a state of energy deficiency. This can lead to hypothalamic amenorrhea, where the hypothalamus reduces the frequency of GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) pulses due to stress, low energy availability, or low body fat. This reduction in GnRH leads to decreased stimulation of the pituitary gland, resulting in lower levels of LH and FSH, and subsequently decreased estrogen production from the ovaries, causing amenorrhea. The other options do not fit the clinical picture: increased prolactin secretion would be associated with galactorrhea and other symptoms; intrauterine adhesions (Asherman's syndrome) typically follow uterine surgery or infection; increased LH and ovarian androgen production are more characteristic of polycystic ovary syndrome, which does not match her presentation.",9
7128,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of dyspepsia, including burning epigastric pain and bloating after meals. Given the absence of alarm features (such as weight loss, anemia, or gastrointestinal bleeding), the next step is to determine if Helicobacter pylori infection is present, as it is a common cause of dyspepsia and peptic ulcer disease. The urea breath test is a non-invasive and accurate method to detect active H. pylori infection. It is preferred over serology (H. pylori serum IgG) because serology cannot distinguish between active and past infection. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to perform a urea breath test to confirm the presence of H. pylori before initiating eradication therapy.",9
7132,"The patient was started on enoxaparin, a low molecular weight heparin, for prophylaxis. On hospital day 5, the patient developed thrombocytopenia (platelet count dropped from 150,000 to 60,000) and an erythematous and necrotic skin lesion. These findings are suggestive of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), which is caused by antibodies to the heparin-platelet factor 4 complex. HIT typically occurs 5-10 days after starting heparin and can lead to thrombocytopenia and thrombosis, which can manifest as skin necrosis. The other options do not fit the clinical picture as well as HIT does.",9
7141,"The newborn's presentation is suggestive of Turner syndrome, characterized by features such as lymphedema (swelling of extremities), low-set ears, a broad chest, and a webbed neck. The systolic ejection murmur and click could indicate aortic coarctation or bicuspid aortic valve, which are associated with Turner syndrome. The swelling in Turner syndrome is due to congenital lymphedema, which results from a dysfunctional lymphatic system. This is because the lymphatic channels are underdeveloped or malformed, leading to accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the tissues.",9
7138,"The clinical presentation of the 10-month-old girl includes irritability, a rash with flaccid, transparent blisters, and brown crusts, along with a positive Nikolsky sign (sloughing of skin with shear force). These findings are characteristic of Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSSS). SSSS is caused by the release of exfoliative toxins, specifically exfoliative toxin A and B, by Staphylococcus aureus. These toxins target desmoglein 1, a component of desmosomes in the epidermis, leading to the separation of the epidermal layers and the formation of blisters. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is the release of exfoliative toxin A.",9
7142,"The boy presents with fever, sore throat, and discrete papulovesicular lesions on the posterior oropharynx. These findings are characteristic of herpangina, which is commonly caused by Coxsackie A virus. Herpangina is associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease, which is also caused by Coxsackie virus. The other options are associated with different pathogens or conditions: Rheumatic fever is associated with Streptococcus pyogenes, Burkitt lymphoma with Epstein-Barr virus, and infective endocarditis with bacterial infections. Therefore, the condition most likely associated with the cause of this patient's findings is hand, foot, and mouth disease.",9
7143,"The patient's symptoms include intermittent chest pain that worsens when lying down and after meals, along with a bitter taste in her mouth. These symptoms are suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is caused by decreased lower esophageal sphincter tone. The pain associated with GERD is often exacerbated by lying down and after eating due to increased gastric acid reflux into the esophagus. The bitter taste is likely due to acid reflux reaching the mouth. Her ECG shows no abnormalities, which makes cardiac causes less likely. The other options, such as autodigestion of pancreatic tissue (pancreatitis), blockage of the cystic duct (cholecystitis), and coronary artery disease, do not align as well with the symptom pattern described.",9
7148,"The clinical presentation and echocardiographic findings are consistent with Tetralogy of Fallot, which includes pulmonic stenosis, ventricular septal defect (VSD), right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), and an overriding aorta. The degree of cyanosis and hypoxemic symptoms in Tetralogy of Fallot is primarily determined by the degree of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, which is usually due to the severity of the pulmonic stenosis. More severe stenosis leads to greater right-to-left shunting across the VSD, resulting in increased cyanosis. Squatting increases systemic vascular resistance, which decreases the right-to-left shunt and temporarily alleviates cyanosis. Therefore, the degree of pulmonic stenosis is the best predictor of the degree of cyanosis and hypoxemic symptoms.",9
7145,"The girl's episodes are characterized by staring, facial grimacing, and hand gestures, with no response to external stimuli, which suggests a seizure disorder. The presence of an aura (the muddy taste in her mouth) and postictal confusion and lethargy are indicative of a complex partial seizure. These seizures originate in a specific area of the brain and can involve automatisms such as hand gestures. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures would involve full-body convulsions, which are not described here. Atonic seizures involve sudden loss of muscle tone, which is also not described. Breath-holding spells are typically seen in younger children and are not associated with auras or postictal states.",9
7155,"The patient's symptoms of mild shortness of breath, right-sided chest pain, nonproductive cough, and low-grade fever could potentially indicate a pulmonary embolism (PE), among other conditions. The attending physician has a low suspicion for PE but wants to exclude it using a very sensitive test. The D-dimer test is known for its high sensitivity but low specificity for PE. A negative D-dimer test can effectively rule out PE in patients with low pre-test probability. The other options, such as spiral CT chest with IV contrast and ventilation-perfusion scan, are more specific and used when there is a higher suspicion of PE. A chest radiograph is not specific for PE and is not used to rule it out. Therefore, the most appropriate test to order in this scenario is a D-dimer.",9
7169,"The patient's symptoms and test results are indicative of bacterial vaginosis (BV). The thin grayish-white discharge, elevated pH of 5.9, and the fishy odor upon adding KOH (positive whiff test) are classic signs of BV. BV is caused by an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria, most commonly Gardnerella vaginalis. On microscopic examination, Gardnerella vaginalis appears as gram-variable rods. Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient's vaginal discharge is gram-variable rods.",9
7165,"The patient's symptoms include sudden loss of vision affecting half of her visual field and an inability to recognize her niece, which suggests a problem with visual processing and possibly facial recognition. These symptoms are consistent with occipital lobe involvement, which is supplied by the posterior cerebral artery (PCA). The severe posterior headache could also be associated with PCA stroke. The CT scan ruling out hemorrhagic stroke further supports an ischemic event. The lack of motor or sensory deficits makes a middle cerebral artery stroke less likely. Vertebrobasilar strokes typically affect the brainstem and cerebellum, leading to different symptoms such as dizziness, ataxia, or cranial nerve deficits. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is less likely given the CT findings and the specific visual symptoms. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a posterior cerebral artery stroke.",9
7185,"The patient's presentation is consistent with hairy cell leukemia, characterized by pancytopenia, splenomegaly, and the presence of ""hairy"" cells on a peripheral blood smear that are TRAP positive. The first-line treatment for hairy cell leukemia is cladribine, a purine analog. Cladribine is resistant to breakdown by adenosine deaminase, which allows it to accumulate in cells and exert its cytotoxic effects. This resistance is a key characteristic of cladribine, making option B the correct answer.",9
7176,"The clinical presentation of fever, hypotension, petechiae, and growth on Thayer-Martin agar suggests an infection with Neisseria meningitidis. This organism is known for causing meningococcemia, which can lead to septic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), contributing to its high mortality rate. The virulence factor responsible for the severe symptoms and high mortality is the lipooligosaccharide (LOS), which is an endotoxin. LOS triggers a strong inflammatory response, leading to the symptoms observed in this patient, including shock and petechiae. The other options do not pertain to Neisseria meningitidis or its primary virulence mechanism in causing severe disease.",9
7190,"The patient's symptoms suggest a diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The key features include visual hallucinations, cognitive fluctuations, parkinsonism (evidenced by his short steps and slowed movements), and possible autonomic dysfunction (urinary incontinence). The history of getting lost and confusion about the year also supports cognitive decline. In DLB, brain pathology typically shows eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions known as Lewy bodies, which are composed of alpha-synuclein. This aligns with option A.",9
7195,"The patient's symptoms of worsening memory, urinary incontinence, and gait disturbance suggest normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). NPH is characterized by the triad of dementia, urinary incontinence, and gait disturbance. The gait is often described as a magnetic or shuffling gait. The condition is caused by an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leading to ventricular enlargement without increased intracranial pressure. The most effective treatment for NPH is the placement of a cerebral shunt, which helps to drain excess CSF and can improve symptoms.",9
7193,"The patient is a competent adult who has made an informed decision to stop treatment and pursue palliative care. In medical ethics, respect for patient autonomy is paramount, meaning that a competent patient has the right to make decisions about their own healthcare, even if family members disagree. Since the patient is of sound mind and has considered the benefits and risks, her decision should be respected. Therefore, the appropriate action is to halt treatments and begin palliative care, aligning with her wishes.",9
7191,"The patient is experiencing significant pain from metastatic cancer and is unwilling to continue chemotherapy without effective pain management. High-dose opioids are effective for severe cancer pain but carry risks such as respiratory depression. However, in palliative care, the primary goal is to relieve suffering and improve quality of life. Given the patient's condition and wishes, the benefits of pain relief with high-dose opioids outweigh the risks, especially since he is not responding to chemotherapy and has new metastatic lesions. Therefore, the most appropriate step is to prioritize pain management with high-dose opioids, while monitoring for side effects.",9
7198,"The patient's presentation is consistent with nephrolithiasis, and the imaging findings suggest medullary sponge kidney (MSK), characterized by cystic dilations in the collecting ducts of the renal pyramids. MSK is often associated with nephrolithiasis and can lead to hematuria due to irritation of the urinary tract by stones. Proteinuria is not typically associated with MSK, and malignant hypertension is not a common feature. Renal cell carcinoma is not directly linked to MSK. Therefore, the most likely additional finding in this patient is hematuria, which is common in cases of nephrolithiasis and MSK.",9
7208,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding) and anemia (fatigue, lightheadedness, low hemoglobin). The increased abdominal girth and urinary frequency could suggest a pelvic mass, such as uterine fibroids, which are a common cause of heavy menstrual bleeding in women of this age. While von Willebrand disease could cause heavy menstrual bleeding, the presence of increased abdominal girth and urinary frequency points more towards a structural cause. A pelvic ultrasound is the best initial step to evaluate for uterine fibroids or other pelvic masses that could explain the patient's symptoms.",9
7221,"The patient is a 17-year-old female with primary amenorrhea, normal secondary sexual characteristics, and normal hormone levels. She has a 46 XX karyotype and a normal uterus on ultrasound. The presence of normal secondary sexual characteristics indicates normal ovarian function and estrogen production. The normal uterus rules out Mullerian agenesis (A). Androgen insensitivity (C) is unlikely because the patient has a 46 XX karyotype and normal female secondary sexual characteristics. Pituitary infarct (D) would likely cause abnormal hormone levels, which are not present here. The key detail is the patient's refusal of a vaginal exam, which suggests a structural issue. Failed canalization of the external vaginal membrane (B) could lead to an imperforate hymen or transverse vaginal septum, causing primary amenorrhea and cyclic pelvic pain due to obstructed menstrual flow.",9
7232,"The patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with hepatitis, and the serology indicates an acute infection with a virus that has partially double-stranded, circular DNA. This description matches the hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV is known for its unique replication cycle, which involves reverse transcription. After the virus enters the host cell, its DNA is transported to the nucleus where it is converted into covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). This cccDNA serves as a template for the production of viral RNA, including pregenomic RNA. The pregenomic RNA is then reverse transcribed back into DNA by the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme. Therefore, the replication cycle of HBV involves reverse transcription of viral RNA to DNA.",9
7230,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest an inflammatory bowel disease. The presence of crampy abdominal pain relieved by defecation, diarrhea, fever, and oral ulcers are indicative of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. The elevated ESR supports an inflammatory process. The pruritic ring-like lesion could be erythema nodosum, which is associated with inflammatory bowel diseases. Crohn's disease is characterized by transmural inflammation and granulomas, whereas ulcerative colitis is associated with superficial inflammation and p-ANCA positivity. The presence of oral ulcers and the transmural nature of the inflammation suggest Crohn's disease. Therefore, the best description of this patient's condition is transmural granulomas in the bowel, which is characteristic of Crohn's disease.",9
7223,"The patient's symptoms of tiredness and dyspnea on exertion suggest a systemic condition. The mention of changes in the fingernails is a key clue. In the context of systemic symptoms and nail changes, one should consider conditions that affect both. Iron deficiency anemia is known to cause koilonychia, which are spoon-shaped nails. This is consistent with the systemic symptoms of fatigue and dyspnea due to anemia. Herpetic whitlow and dermatophyte infections are localized to the nails or skin and do not typically cause systemic symptoms like tiredness and dyspnea. Infectious endocarditis can cause systemic symptoms and nail changes, such as splinter hemorrhages, but the combination of symptoms and nail changes in this case is more indicative of iron deficiency anemia.",9
7240,"The patient presents with acute lower abdominal pain, fever, and a history of inconsistent condom use and previous chlamydia infection, raising suspicion for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or an ectopic pregnancy. Given her age and symptoms, an ectopic pregnancy must be ruled out first, as it is a life-threatening condition. The most appropriate initial step in management is to check for pregnancy with a serum β-hCG concentration. This will help determine if the symptoms could be due to an ectopic pregnancy, which would require immediate attention.",9
7235,"The clinical presentation of the 9-month-old girl suggests Tay-Sachs disease, which is common in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. The symptoms include developmental regression, hypotonia, hyperreflexia, and the presence of a cherry-red spot on fundoscopy. Tay-Sachs disease is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hexosaminidase A, leading to the accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in neurons. The absence of hepatosplenomegaly helps differentiate it from Niemann-Pick disease, which also presents with a cherry-red spot but includes organomegaly.",9
7242,"The patient's presentation is consistent with acute appendicitis, characterized by abdominal pain, fever, and leukocytosis. The pain associated with inflammation is often mediated by chemical substances that sensitize or stimulate pain receptors. Bradykinin is a well-known mediator that causes pain by directly stimulating nerve endings. Prostaglandins, particularly PGE2, sensitize nerve endings to other pain-producing stimuli. Together, bradykinin and prostaglandins are key mediators in the pain response during inflammatory processes such as appendicitis.",9
7241,"The patient presents with acute neck rigidity and inability to move his neck, which is suggestive of acute dystonia, a type of extrapyramidal side effect often associated with antipsychotic medications. Given his recent diagnosis of schizophrenia, it is likely that he has been started on an antipsychotic medication, which can cause such side effects. The best initial treatment for acute dystonia is an anticholinergic agent or an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties, such as diphenhydramine. This will help alleviate the muscle spasms and rigidity. Dantrolene is used for malignant hyperthermia or neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which is not indicated here. Changing medication to clozapine is not an immediate management step, and propranolol is used for akathisia, not acute dystonia.",9
7244,"The patient is undergoing chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma and is experiencing nausea and vomiting, which are common side effects of chemotherapy. To manage these symptoms, antiemetic medications are often used. The patient was started on an appropriate medication for nausea, but later developed headaches and constipation.

The side effects of the antiemetic medications can help identify which one was used. Cannabinoid receptor agonists can cause side effects such as dizziness and dry mouth, but they are less commonly associated with headaches and constipation. H1 antagonists, like diphenhydramine, can cause sedation and dry mouth, but headaches and constipation are not typical. D2 antagonists, such as metoclopramide, can cause extrapyramidal symptoms and sedation, but again, headaches and constipation are not typical side effects.

5-HT3 antagonists, such as ondansetron, are commonly used to treat chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. They are known to cause headaches and constipation as side effects. Given the patient's symptoms of headaches and constipation after starting the antiemetic, it is most likely that he was treated with a 5-HT3 antagonist.",9
7250,"The patient's presentation is consistent with bullous pemphigoid, an autoimmune blistering disorder. Key features include tense blisters on an erythematous base, typically affecting the trunk and flexor surfaces. The negative Nikolsky sign (blisters do not extend with lateral traction) further supports this diagnosis. Bullous pemphigoid is caused by antibodies against hemidesmosomes, which are structures that anchor the epidermis to the dermis. This is in contrast to pemphigus vulgaris, where antibodies target desmosomes, leading to flaccid blisters and a positive Nikolsky sign.",9
7262,"The patient presents with symptoms of anemia (weakness, pallor, shortness of breath) and has a positive stool occult blood test, suggesting gastrointestinal bleeding. She has been taking aspirin, which can cause gastrointestinal bleeding and affect platelet function. Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversibly inhibiting cyclooxygenase, leading to a prolonged bleeding time. This is because aspirin affects the function of platelets, not their number, and does not directly affect the coagulation cascade (which would alter PT or D-dimer levels). Therefore, in the context of aspirin use and bleeding, a prolonged bleeding time is expected due to impaired platelet function.",9
7274,"The clinical presentation suggests transient synovitis, a common cause of hip pain in children following a viral infection. The child has a recent history of a cold, normal vital signs, and an unremarkable hip radiograph. The CRP is low, indicating low likelihood of bacterial infection. The absence of fever and normal inflammatory markers make septic arthritis less likely. Therefore, the best next step is symptomatic treatment with NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, to relieve pain and inflammation.",9
7276,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest that the child has beta-thalassemia minor (beta-thalassemia trait). The key findings include microcytic anemia (low MCV), elevated hemoglobin A2, and target cells on the peripheral smear. These findings are characteristic of beta-thalassemia trait. The elevated hemoglobin A2 is particularly indicative of beta-thalassemia. In beta-thalassemia trait, patients typically have mild anemia and do not require specific treatment, such as iron supplementation, unless there is evidence of iron deficiency. In this case, there is no indication of iron deficiency (e.g., low ferritin or iron studies), so iron supplementation is not needed. The appropriate management for beta-thalassemia trait is reassurance, as it is a benign condition that does not require treatment.",9
7272,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest Legionnaires' disease, a type of pneumonia caused by Legionella pneumophila. Key features include fever, cough, shortness of breath, gastrointestinal symptoms (such as diarrhea), and hyponatremia. The history of attending a business meeting at a hotel and other coworkers becoming sick is consistent with a potential outbreak, as Legionella is often associated with contaminated water sources in hotels. The most appropriate diagnostic test for Legionella pneumonia is the urine antigen assay, which is rapid and specific for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, the most common cause of Legionnaires' disease.",9
7278,"The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of meningococcal meningitis, caused by Neisseria meningitidis. Key features include severe headache, photophobia, myalgias, fever, petechiae, ecchymoses, neck stiffness, and altered mental status. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows a high neutrophil count and elevated lactate, consistent with bacterial meningitis. The fact that she is a college student living in a dormitory, a setting with increased risk for meningococcal disease, further supports this diagnosis. The polysaccharide conjugate vaccine is used to prevent meningococcal infections, which would have been effective in preventing this condition.",9
7277,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest a hemolytic anemia, likely due to a red blood cell enzyme deficiency. The presence of Heinz bodies and blister cells on the peripheral smear is indicative of oxidative damage to red blood cells, which is characteristic of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. This condition is more common in African American males and can lead to episodes of hemolysis triggered by certain drugs, infections, or foods. The negative Coombs test rules out autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The reticulocytosis and indirect hyperbilirubinemia further support hemolysis. The most appropriate test to confirm G6PD deficiency is the Methemoglobin reduction test, which assesses the ability of red blood cells to reduce methemoglobin, a process dependent on G6PD activity.",9
7282,"The patient presents with chronic diarrhea, weight loss, macrocytic anemia, and signs of malabsorption (e.g., foul-smelling stools, low hemoglobin, high MCV, and fecal fat content). The negative anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA test suggests that celiac disease is unlikely. The travel history to Bangladesh raises suspicion for tropical sprue, which is characterized by malabsorption and megaloblastic anemia due to folate and/or vitamin B12 deficiency. A PAS-stained biopsy of the small bowel can help identify the presence of foamy macrophages in the lamina propria, which are indicative of Whipple's disease, but this is less likely given the presentation. However, a biopsy can also help confirm tropical sprue by showing villous atrophy and inflammatory changes. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to perform an enteroscopy to obtain a biopsy of the small bowel to confirm the diagnosis of tropical sprue.",9
7289,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of acute bacterial prostatitis, including fever, urinary frequency, lower back pain, and a swollen, tender prostate on examination. The elevated leukocyte count supports an infectious process. In cases of suspected acute bacterial prostatitis, the most appropriate next step is to confirm the diagnosis and identify the causative organism. This is typically done through a urine culture, which will help guide antibiotic therapy. Other options, such as transrectal ultrasonography or measuring serum prostate-specific antigen, are not immediately necessary for the management of acute prostatitis. Administering tamsulosin may help with urinary symptoms but does not address the underlying infection.",9
7290,"The patient has a history of a febrile illness with lower abdominal pain, which could suggest a past pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID can lead to tubal scarring, which is a common cause of infertility due to obstruction of the fallopian tubes. Her regular menstrual cycles and normal semen analysis in her husband make other causes like PCOS or primary ovarian insufficiency less likely. Long-term use of oral contraceptives does not typically cause infertility after discontinuation. Given her history and symptoms, tubal scarring is the most likely cause of her infertility.",9
7285,"The patient presents with symptoms of intermittent claudication, which is characterized by cramping pain in the legs during exertion that resolves with rest. This is typically due to reduced blood flow to the muscles, often caused by peripheral artery disease (PAD). The patient's risk factors include a long history of smoking and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, both of which are significant risk factors for atherosclerosis. The diminished femoral pulses on examination further support the presence of arterial insufficiency. Atherosclerosis, which involves the buildup of plaques in the arterial walls, is the most common cause of PAD and would explain the patient's symptoms and examination findings. Other options, such as narrowing of the spinal canal (which would cause neurogenic claudication), venous thrombosis (which would cause swelling and pain not relieved by rest), and non-atherosclerotic vasculitis (which is less common and would present differently), are less likely given the clinical presentation and risk factors.",9
7308,"The patient's symptoms include sudden-onset slurring of speech (dysarthria) and difficulty with skilled movements of the right hand, particularly writing, which suggests a clumsy hand. The presence of right-sided facial weakness with preserved forehead wrinkling indicates a central facial palsy, likely due to a lacunar stroke. The normal head CT scan suggests no large hemorrhagic stroke. The combination of dysarthria and clumsy hand points towards a lacunar syndrome, specifically dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome, which is associated with a small infarct in the pons or internal capsule. The patient's risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking, increase the likelihood of a lacunar stroke.",9
7302,"The patient's symptoms suggest a right oculomotor nerve (CN III) palsy. The key features include ptosis (drooping of the eyelid), the eye being 'down and out' due to unopposed action of the lateral rectus and superior oblique muscles, and a dilated pupil that does not react to light or accommodation. These findings are characteristic of a compressive lesion affecting the oculomotor nerve, particularly involving the parasympathetic fibers that control pupil constriction. An aneurysm of the posterior communicating artery is a common cause of such a compressive lesion, as it can impinge on the oculomotor nerve where it exits the midbrain. The other options are less likely to cause this specific pattern of symptoms: demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus would cause internuclear ophthalmoplegia, a pituitary adenoma typically affects the optic chiasm causing visual field defects, and a midbrain infarction would likely cause more extensive neurological deficits.",9
7309,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs consistent with pneumonia, likely community-acquired given his nursing home residence. The chest X-ray shows right upper and middle lobe infiltrates, which are common in bacterial pneumonia. The most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia in elderly patients is Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a Gram-positive diplococcus. The patient's rapid deterioration and death despite treatment suggest a severe infection, which is consistent with pneumococcal pneumonia. Therefore, the Gram stain of the sputum would most likely show Gram-positive diplococci.",9
7304,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with chronic tension-type headaches, characterized by dull, pressing, non-pulsating pain that is not aggravated by physical activity and lacks associated symptoms like nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia. These headaches occur frequently, about 20 days per month, which classifies them as chronic. Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, is commonly used for the prophylactic treatment of chronic tension-type headaches. It helps reduce the frequency and severity of these headaches. Ergotamine is used for migraine treatment, aspirin is for acute pain relief, and valproate is used for migraine prophylaxis, making them less appropriate for this case.",9
7312,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest a case of Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS). The patient has a history of abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, and diarrhea, which are common preceding symptoms of HUS, often associated with a diarrheal illness caused by E. coli O157:H7. The presence of blood in the urine, intense flank pain, and hypertension indicate renal involvement. The laboratory findings show anemia (low hemoglobin), thrombocytopenia (low platelets), and schistocytes on the peripheral smear, which are indicative of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. These findings, along with acute renal failure, are characteristic of HUS. The elevated white blood cell count is consistent with an inflammatory response. The rapid deterioration and severe hypertension further support the diagnosis of HUS, which can lead to acute renal failure and other systemic complications.",9
7324,"The patient's presentation is consistent with osteoarthritis, characterized by joint pain that worsens with activity and improves with rest. The tenderness along the medial joint line suggests involvement of the knee joint, which is common in osteoarthritis. Heberden nodes are associated with osteoarthritis but are found in the distal interphalangeal joints of the fingers, not the knee. Association with HLA-DR4 and joint pannus are related to rheumatoid arthritis. Marginal sclerosis, or subchondral sclerosis, is a radiographic finding in osteoarthritis, indicating increased bone density at the joint margins due to the degenerative process. Given the patient's symptoms and the typical findings in osteoarthritis, marginal sclerosis is the most likely finding.",9
7318,"The patient presents with painless hematuria, weight loss, and a bladder mass, which are suggestive of bladder cancer. The most concerning risk factor for bladder cancer, particularly in someone working in a chemical plant, is exposure to aromatic amines. These chemicals are well-known occupational risk factors for bladder cancer. Vinyl chloride is associated with liver angiosarcoma, not bladder cancer. Alcohol is not a significant risk factor for bladder cancer, and there is no strong indication of a genetic predisposition in this case.",9
7310,"The patient's symptoms and findings suggest a possible lymphoma, particularly Hodgkin's lymphoma, given the presence of painless lymphadenopathy, mediastinal widening, and systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss). The most definitive way to confirm a diagnosis of lymphoma is through histological examination of the lymph node tissue. An excisional biopsy allows for the complete removal of a lymph node, providing sufficient tissue for histopathological analysis to identify characteristic features such as Reed-Sternberg cells in Hodgkin's lymphoma. Other options like leukocyte count, sputum PCR, or CT scan are not definitive for diagnosing lymphoma.",9
7326,"The patient is pregnant and non-immune to measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR). The MMR vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine and is contraindicated during pregnancy due to potential risks to the fetus. Therefore, it should not be administered during pregnancy. The best approach is to wait until after delivery to vaccinate the patient. Since she is already known to be non-immune, there is no need to repeat serology testing before vaccination. Thus, the next best step is to plan for the MMR vaccine postpartum.",9
7327,"The patient presents with sudden onset of right-sided weakness, facial drooping, and paralysis of the right upper and lower extremities, with exaggerated deep tendon reflexes on the right. Sensation is intact, and she has no issues with speech or swallowing. These symptoms suggest a pure motor stroke, likely due to a lacunar infarct affecting the internal capsule, where motor fibers are concentrated. The lenticulostriate arteries, which are branches of the middle cerebral artery, supply the internal capsule. An occlusion here would lead to the described motor deficits without sensory loss or cortical signs (such as aphasia or neglect).",9
7334,"The newborn's presentation is consistent with Potter sequence, which is characterized by oligohydramnios leading to facial deformities (such as low-set ears and retrognathia), limb deformities (such as club feet), and pulmonary hypoplasia causing respiratory distress. The periportal fibrosis in the liver is also associated with congenital hepatic fibrosis, which can be seen in autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). ARPKD is caused by a mutation on the short arm of chromosome 6, not 16. However, the key feature here is the cystic dilation of the collecting ducts, which is characteristic of ARPKD. This condition leads to oligohydramnios due to impaired kidney function, resulting in the features observed in the newborn.",9
7338,"The boy's symptoms and the CT scan findings suggest gastric distention, likely due to gastric outlet obstruction or gastric volvulus, which can occur after trauma, especially with the use of an adult seatbelt in children. The distended and tender abdomen, along with dry mucous membranes, indicates possible dehydration and gastric outlet obstruction. Nasogastric decompression is a common initial management step to relieve gastric distention and prevent further complications. Total parenteral nutrition is not immediately necessary but may be considered if prolonged bowel rest is required. Oral rehydration and early refeeding are not appropriate given the gastric distention. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is not the immediate next step in this acute setting. Focused assessment with sonography for trauma is more relevant for assessing free fluid or solid organ injury, not for gastric distention.",9
7344,"In mechanical ventilation, oxygenation is primarily affected by FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) and PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure). FiO2 increases the amount of oxygen delivered to the alveoli, while PEEP prevents alveolar collapse at the end of expiration, thereby improving oxygenation by increasing the functional residual capacity and keeping alveoli open. Tidal volume and respiratory rate primarily affect ventilation (removal of CO2) rather than oxygenation. Therefore, the adjustment of FiO2 and PEEP will specifically target the patient's oxygenation without directly affecting ventilation.",9
7353,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with an immediate hypersensitivity reaction following a bee sting, including skin rash, swelling, itching, and respiratory distress (stridor). These symptoms suggest an anaphylactic reaction, which is a Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction. Type 1 hypersensitivity reactions are IgE-mediated and occur rapidly after exposure to an allergen, such as a bee sting. The other types of hypersensitivity reactions (Type 2, Type 3, and Type 4) do not fit the clinical presentation. Type 2 involves antibody-mediated cytotoxicity, Type 3 involves immune complex deposition, and Type 4 is a delayed-type hypersensitivity mediated by T cells. Therefore, the correct answer is that the patient is experiencing a Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction.",9
7352,"The patient presents with decreased urinary output, fever, and a significant increase in serum creatinine, indicating acute kidney injury. The mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet and ischemic changes on the toe suggest a vascular issue, likely embolic in nature. The leukocytosis with eosinophilia is a key finding. Two weeks after cardiac catheterization, cholesterol embolization is a known complication, characterized by the release of cholesterol crystals from atherosclerotic plaques, leading to embolization in small vessels. This can cause skin changes (livedo reticularis), renal impairment, and eosinophilia. Allergic interstitial nephritis typically presents with eosinophilia and renal impairment but is more commonly associated with drug reactions and does not explain the skin findings. Contrast-induced nephropathy usually occurs within days of exposure and does not cause eosinophilia or skin changes. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis involves systemic vasculitis and asthma, which are not present here. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's presentation is cholesterol embolization.",9
7360,"The patient presents with symptoms and imaging findings consistent with a ruptured appendicitis leading to a localized abscess formation. The CT scan shows a fluid collection with an enhancing wall, indicating an abscess. In such cases, immediate surgery is not typically performed due to the risk of complications from inflammation and infection. Instead, the standard approach is to manage the patient conservatively with antibiotics and bowel rest, allowing the inflammation to subside. Once the acute phase is managed, an interval appendectomy is scheduled after 6-8 weeks to prevent recurrence. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to continue conservative management and plan for an appendectomy later.",9
7349,"The clinical presentation suggests hereditary spherocytosis, characterized by jaundice, splenomegaly, and a high mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). The negative Coombs test rules out autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The peripheral blood smear likely shows spherocytes. Patients with hereditary spherocytosis are at increased risk for gallstones due to chronic hemolysis leading to increased bilirubin production. These gallstones can lead to cholecystitis. While there is a risk of osteomyelitis in patients with sickle cell disease due to Salmonella infections, hereditary spherocytosis is more associated with gallstone-related complications.",9
7359,"The patient is presenting with hypotension, tachycardia, cool and clammy extremities, and weak, thready pulses, which are indicative of shock. The firm and distended abdomen with decreased bowel sounds suggests possible intra-abdominal bleeding or injury, which is common in trauma cases and can lead to hypovolemic shock due to blood loss. Neurogenic shock would typically present with warm, dry skin and bradycardia due to loss of sympathetic tone, which is not the case here. Cardiogenic shock would likely present with signs of heart failure, such as pulmonary edema, which is also not observed. Obstructive shock, such as from a tension pneumothorax or cardiac tamponade, would have specific findings like jugular venous distension or respiratory distress, which are not present. Therefore, the most likely cause of her presentation is hypovolemic shock due to intra-abdominal bleeding.",9
7358,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of iron deficiency anemia, likely due to chronic blood loss. The positive stool occult blood test and colonoscopy findings of an exophytic ulcer in the ascending colon suggest a colorectal carcinoma. The question asks for the greatest predisposing factor for this condition. Among the options, adenomatous polyps are known precursors to colorectal cancer. Villous adenomatous polyps have a higher risk of malignant transformation compared to tubular adenomatous polyps. Hyperplastic polyps are generally considered benign with low malignant potential, and lipomatous polyps are not typically associated with cancer risk. Therefore, the villous adenomatous polyp is the greatest predisposing factor for colorectal cancer.",9
7363,"The patient's symptoms suggest aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), which is characterized by asthma, nasal polyps, and sensitivity to aspirin and other NSAIDs. The symptoms of waking up short of breath and coughing attacks are consistent with asthma exacerbation due to aspirin sensitivity. In such cases, leukotriene receptor antagonists like montelukast are often used to manage symptoms and prevent similar reactions, as they help block the effects of leukotrienes, which are involved in the inflammatory response triggered by aspirin in sensitive individuals.",9
7362,"The patient presents with symptoms and findings suggestive of a chronic interstitial lung disease. The key features include shortness of breath on exertion, dry cough, nail clubbing, bilateral crackles, and a significant smoking history. The chest radiograph shows basal reticulonodular patterns, and pulmonary function tests reveal a severely reduced DLCO and desaturation with exercise. These findings are consistent with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), which is characterized by progressive fibrosis of the lung interstitium, often presenting with a pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) on imaging. The presence of clubbing and the pattern of crackles further support IPF over other options. Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis is more associated with cystic changes and upper lobe involvement, while chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis would typically have a history of antigen exposure and different imaging findings. Pleuropulmonary fibroelastosis is rare and presents differently. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.",9
7373,"The newborn exhibits several characteristic features that align with a specific chromosomal disorder. The presence of micrognathia, prominent occiput, low-set ears, clenched fists with overlapping fingers, and a holosystolic murmur are classic signs of Trisomy 18, also known as Edwards syndrome. The description of the feet with prominent heels and convex, rounded soles further supports this diagnosis. Trisomy 18 is known for these distinct physical findings, whereas the other options do not match the combination of features described.",9
7382,"The patient is a 35-year-old woman with a palpable liver mass and hypervascular lesions on CT scan. She is on oral contraceptives, which are associated with hepatic adenomas. The normal serum α-fetoprotein level suggests that hepatocellular carcinoma is less likely. Hepatic adenomas are benign liver tumors that can be associated with the use of oral contraceptives. The first step in managing hepatic adenomas, especially if they are small and asymptomatic, is to discontinue oral contraceptives to see if the adenomas regress. Surgical intervention or biopsy is not immediately indicated unless the adenomas are large, symptomatic, or there is suspicion of malignancy.",9
7387,"The patient is one week post-abdominal hysterectomy and presents with fever, tachycardia, and lower abdominal pain. The leukocytosis with a left shift (increased neutrophils and bands) suggests an infection. The surgical site is red, indicating possible inflammation or infection, but there is no drainage. The urine analysis shows no significant signs of a urinary tract infection (UTI) as nitrites and leukocyte esterase are negative, and there are minimal WBCs and bacteria. The hypoactive bowel sounds and abdominal tenderness could suggest a post-operative ileus, but this would not typically cause fever and leukocytosis. Given the fever, leukocytosis, and redness around the surgical site, a wound infection is the most likely cause of the symptoms.",9
7389,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest Wilson's disease, a genetic disorder leading to copper accumulation, particularly affecting the liver and brain. Key symptoms include tremor, dysarthria, dysmetria, and psychiatric changes. The soaked pillow indicates sialorrhea, and the eye photograph likely shows Kayser-Fleischer rings, a hallmark of Wilson's disease. The broad-based gait, tremor, and hyperreflexia further support this diagnosis. The most appropriate treatment for Wilson's disease is a chelating agent to remove excess copper, and penicillamine is commonly used for this purpose.",9
7390,"The patient presents with signs of infection at the surgical site, fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and a diffuse macular rash. The Gram stain shows purple cocci in clusters, which is indicative of Staphylococcus aureus. The symptoms and the organism suggest toxic shock syndrome (TSS), which is caused by the release of toxins by certain strains of Staphylococcus aureus. The specific toxin responsible for TSS in this context is Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin 1 (TSST-1). This toxin acts as a superantigen, leading to widespread immune activation and the clinical features observed in the patient.",9
7394,"The patient's symptoms suggest cystic fibrosis (CF), which is characterized by recurrent respiratory infections, hepatobiliary disease, and infertility due to obstructive azoospermia (absence of sperm in semen). CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which encodes a chloride channel. This channel is regulated by ATP binding and phosphorylation. The CFTR channel opens in response to the binding of ATP, allowing chloride ions to pass through the channel. This defect leads to the thick mucus secretions seen in CF, affecting the lungs, liver, and reproductive system.",9
7400,"The clinical presentation of the 4-year-old boy is suggestive of Kawasaki disease, which is characterized by prolonged fever, rash, conjunctivitis, mucosal changes (such as cracked lips), cervical lymphadenopathy, and extremity changes (such as desquamation). One of the most serious complications of Kawasaki disease is the development of coronary artery aneurysms. Therefore, it is crucial to screen the coronary arteries for possible complications in this patient.",10
7399,"The patient has a segmental pulmonary embolism (PE), which is a type of venous thromboembolism. The standard treatment for a PE is anticoagulation. Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant that requires several days to reach therapeutic levels, so it is not used alone initially. Instead, a rapid-acting anticoagulant like heparin is used first. Heparin can be administered as unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Once the patient is stabilized on heparin, warfarin is started and the two are overlapped (bridged) until the INR is therapeutic. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is used for massive PE with hemodynamic instability, which is not the case here. An IVC filter is considered when anticoagulation is contraindicated or if there is recurrent PE despite anticoagulation. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment plan is to initiate heparin with a bridge to warfarin.",9
7402,"To determine how many cases of cardiovascular death would be prevented, we first need to calculate the event rates for both groups. 

For the losartan group:
- Cardiovascular death rate = 300/1500 = 0.20 (20%)

For the placebo group:
- Cardiovascular death rate = 350/1400 = 0.25 (25%)

The absolute risk reduction (ARR) is the difference in these rates:
- ARR = 0.25 - 0.20 = 0.05 (5%)

To find out how many cases of cardiovascular death would be prevented in 200 patients, we multiply the ARR by the number of patients:
- Prevented cases = 0.05 * 200 = 10

Thus, on average, 10 cases of cardiovascular death would be prevented.",10
7401,"The patient presents with symptoms of hypoglycemia (shaking, sweating, palpitations, confusion, hunger) and has a low blood glucose level of 50 mg/dL. The key laboratory finding is a low C-peptide level (0.50 ng/mL), which is below the normal range. C-peptide is a byproduct of endogenous insulin production, so low levels suggest that the insulin is not being produced by the pancreas. This is consistent with exogenous insulin administration, as exogenous insulin does not contain C-peptide. The presence of an anechoic lesion in the pancreas could suggest an insulinoma, but an insulinoma would typically cause elevated C-peptide levels due to increased endogenous insulin production. The patient's occupation as a nurse aide may provide access to insulin, supporting the possibility of surreptitious insulin use. Therefore, the most likely cause of the symptoms is surreptitious insulin use.",9
7411,"During exercise, the cardiovascular system undergoes several changes to meet the increased metabolic demands of the body. One of the key changes is a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. This occurs because of vasodilation in the skeletal muscles, which allows for increased blood flow to meet the oxygen and nutrient demands of the exercising muscles. Although cardiac output increases due to increased heart rate and stroke volume, the overall systemic vascular resistance decreases due to the widespread vasodilation. Therefore, the correct answer is a decrease in systemic vascular resistance.",9
7407,"The patient presents with symptoms and lab findings suggestive of hereditary spherocytosis, a condition characterized by hemolytic anemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly. The lab findings show anemia with a high reticulocyte index and increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), which are indicative of spherocytosis. The management of hereditary spherocytosis often involves splenectomy to reduce hemolysis and improve anemia. However, before splenectomy, patients should receive vaccinations against encapsulated organisms (e.g., pneumococcus, meningococcus, and Haemophilus influenzae type b) to prevent infections. Additionally, penicillin prophylaxis is recommended for at least one year post-splenectomy to further reduce the risk of infections. Therefore, the next step in management is vaccinations followed by splenectomy and penicillin for one year.",9
7410,"The patient is in active labor at 39 weeks' gestation and has a history of genital herpes with current active lesions. The presence of active genital herpes lesions at the time of labor poses a significant risk of neonatal herpes transmission during vaginal delivery. The standard management in such cases is to perform a cesarean delivery to prevent neonatal herpes infection. While acyclovir can be used to treat herpes outbreaks, it does not eliminate the risk of transmission during vaginal delivery if active lesions are present. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to proceed with a cesarean delivery to minimize the risk to the newborn.",9
7413,"The patient is experiencing difficulty hearing high-frequency sounds, which is a common symptom of sensorineural hearing loss. The Rinne test showing air conduction greater than bone conduction bilaterally and the Weber test not lateralizing suggest that there is no conductive hearing loss, indicating a sensorineural issue. The patient's occupation as an aircraft marshaller exposes him to loud noises, which can lead to noise-induced hearing loss. This type of hearing loss is typically due to damage to the hair cells in the organ of Corti, particularly affecting the ability to hear high-frequency sounds. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is destruction of the organ of Corti due to noise exposure.",9
7414,"At 24 weeks of gestation, it is standard practice to screen for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is the recommended screening method for GDM during this period of pregnancy. This test is typically performed between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation. The other options are not standard screening tests at this stage of pregnancy. Fasting and random glucose testing are not the standard methods for screening GDM. Wet mount microscopy is used for diagnosing infections like bacterial vaginosis, not for routine screening in asymptomatic pregnant women. A complete blood count can be done to check for anemia, but the timing and context of the question suggest that the focus is on screening for GDM.",9
7416,"The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has received the PPSV23 vaccine 4 years ago and the zoster vaccine 1 year ago. His last colonoscopy was 7 years ago and was normal. He quit smoking 17 years ago after a 20 pack-year history. He is planning to travel to Australia and New Zealand in 2 weeks.

- **Influenza vaccine (A):** The influenza vaccine is typically recommended annually, especially before the flu season. However, it is May, and the flu season in the Northern Hemisphere is generally from October to May. Since he is traveling to the Southern Hemisphere, where the flu season is from May to October, it would be appropriate to recommend the influenza vaccine.

- **Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 13 (B):** The PCV13 is recommended for adults 65 years and older who have not previously received it. Since he is 62, this is not immediately necessary unless he has specific risk factors, which are not mentioned here.

- **Abdominal ultrasound (C):** This is typically recommended for screening abdominal aortic aneurysm in men aged 65-75 who have ever smoked. He is 62 and quit smoking 17 years ago, so this is not immediately necessary.

- **Colonoscopy (D):** Colonoscopy is recommended every 10 years for average-risk individuals starting at age 50. His last colonoscopy was 7 years ago and was normal, so he is not yet due for another.

Given the timing of his travel to the Southern Hemisphere and the upcoming flu season there, the most appropriate recommendation is the influenza vaccine.",9
7419,"The patient has experienced multiple episodes of depressive symptoms over the past 3 years, with a maximum symptom-free interval of one month. This pattern suggests a chronic course of depressive symptoms. Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) is characterized by a chronic form of depression lasting at least 2 years in adults, with no more than 2 months symptom-free at a time. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood is less likely because the symptoms have been recurrent over 3 years, not just in response to his mother's death. Major depressive disorder typically involves discrete episodes of depression lasting at least 2 weeks, but the chronicity here suggests persistent depressive disorder. Persistent complex bereavement disorder is related to prolonged grief, but the symptoms here are more consistent with a chronic depressive disorder rather than grief-specific symptoms.",9
7434,"The patient is experiencing heavy uterine bleeding after a cesarean section, which is a classic presentation of postpartum hemorrhage. The examination reveals a soft uterus, indicating uterine atony, which is the most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage. Uterine atony refers to the lack of effective contraction of the uterine muscles after delivery, leading to excessive bleeding. The fact that the bleeding continues despite uterotonics and other interventions further supports the diagnosis of uterine atony. The other options are less likely: uterine inversion would present with a different clinical picture, adherent placenta (placenta accreta) would have been noted during the cesarean section, and uterine rupture would typically present with more dramatic signs and symptoms during labor or delivery.",9
7423,"The patient presents with menorrhagia (increased flow and duration of menses), dyspareunia, and cyclical lower abdominal pain. The pelvic examination reveals an asymmetrically enlarged, nodular uterus. These findings are suggestive of uterine fibroids (leiomyomas), which are benign tumors of the myometrium. The nodular and enlarged uterus is characteristic of fibroids, and they can cause heavy menstrual bleeding and pain. The negative pregnancy test rules out pregnancy-related causes. The patient's BMI and family history of cervical cancer are noted but do not directly relate to the current symptoms. Therefore, the most likely cause of the findings is a benign tumor of the myometrium.",9
7435,"The patient presents with signs of hemodynamic instability (hypotension, tachycardia, dyspnea) shortly after aortic valve replacement surgery. The ECG likely shows a tachyarrhythmia, given the pulse rate of 192/min. In the context of severe chest pain and hemodynamic instability, the most likely arrhythmia is ventricular tachycardia (VT) or possibly supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy. The key point is the patient's instability, which necessitates immediate intervention. Synchronized cardioversion is the treatment of choice for unstable tachyarrhythmias, regardless of whether they are ventricular or supraventricular in origin. Vagal maneuvers and medications like magnesium sulfate or amiodarone are more appropriate for stable patients. Therefore, the most appropriate intervention is synchronized cardioversion.",9
7442,"The patient presents with severe shoulder pain, tenderness over the greater tuberosity, inability to adduct the arm after passive abduction, and limited external rotation due to pain. These symptoms, along with the x-ray findings of sclerosis of the acromion and humeral head, suggest chronic rotator cuff pathology, possibly a rotator cuff tear. The subacromial injection of lidocaine not relieving symptoms further supports a structural issue rather than just inflammation. 

Musculoskeletal ultrasound is a non-invasive, cost-effective method to evaluate soft tissue structures like the rotator cuff and can help confirm the presence of a tear. It is appropriate for further evaluation of suspected rotator cuff pathology before considering more invasive interventions like surgery. 

Surgical fixation is not indicated without confirming a diagnosis that requires it. Biopsy of the humerus is unnecessary as there is no indication of a neoplastic process. Reassurance is not appropriate given the significant functional impairment and pain.",9
7439,"The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings suggest a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, specifically in the head of the pancreas. The key findings include severe epigastric pain after eating, weight loss, scleral icterus (jaundice), and a large non-tender gallbladder (Courvoisier's sign). These are indicative of a mass obstructing the bile duct, commonly seen in pancreatic cancer. Among the options, CA-19-9 is a tumor marker that is often elevated in pancreatic cancer, making it the most likely substance to be elevated in this patient's serum.",9
7445,"The patient presents with symptoms of fever, chills, productive cough with hemoptysis, and shortness of breath, along with a history of chemotherapy, which suggests neutropenia (leukocyte count of 700/mm3). The positive galactomannan antigen test is indicative of an invasive fungal infection, most likely aspergillosis, which is common in immunocompromised patients such as those undergoing chemotherapy. The low oxygen saturation and crackles in the lung suggest a pulmonary infection. Given the positive galactomannan test and the patient's immunocompromised state, the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy is an antifungal agent. Voriconazole is the treatment of choice for invasive aspergillosis.",9
7451,"The patient's symptoms of difficulty swallowing, weight loss, and halitosis, along with the barium swallow and manometry findings, suggest a motility disorder of the esophagus. The key finding from the manometry is the very high pressure at the lower esophageal sphincter, which is characteristic of achalasia. Achalasia is a condition where there is failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax and loss of peristalsis in the esophagus. In this case, the patient's origin from Argentina is a significant clue, as Trypanosoma cruzi infection (Chagas disease) is endemic in South America and can cause secondary achalasia due to destruction of the myenteric plexus. This aligns with the symptoms and manometry findings.",9
7447,"The patient presents with intermittent dysphagia and a barium esophagogram showing a complete obstruction at the lower esophagus with an irregular filling defect. The endoscopy reveals a constricting ring at the gastroesophageal junction, which is consistent with a Schatzki ring. The biopsy shows squamocolumnar epithelium with no metaplasia, ruling out Barrett's esophagus or malignancy. The most appropriate management for a symptomatic Schatzki ring causing dysphagia is mechanical dilation to relieve the obstruction.",9
7458,"The patient presents with signs of a severe foot infection, likely due to his poorly controlled diabetes and peripheral artery disease. The presence of wet gangrene, indicated by the foul-smelling discharge, blistering, and black discoloration, is a critical finding. Wet gangrene is a surgical emergency because it can rapidly lead to systemic infection and sepsis, as evidenced by the patient's fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. While diminished peripheral pulses, positive blood cultures, and a smoking history are relevant to his overall condition, the presence of wet gangrene is the most immediate and strongest indication for amputation to prevent further systemic spread of infection and to save the patient's life.",9
7452,"The patient is presenting with signs of hypovolemic shock, likely due to intra-abdominal bleeding following a traumatic injury. The FAST exam shows fluid in Morison's pouch, indicating possible hemoperitoneum. Despite initial fluid resuscitation, the patient's vital signs are still concerning, with hypotension and tachycardia, suggesting ongoing bleeding. In this context, the best next step is to control the source of bleeding. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is not necessary as the FAST exam already indicates intra-abdominal fluid. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is not appropriate given the acute trauma setting. Close observation is not sufficient due to the hemodynamic instability. Therefore, the best next step is an emergency laparotomy to identify and control the source of bleeding.",9
7459,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest a sideroblastic anemia. The key findings include high serum iron, high ferritin, low TIBC, and the presence of ringed sideroblasts on the peripheral blood smear. Sideroblastic anemia is often due to a defect in heme synthesis, particularly involving the enzyme delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS), which requires pyridoxine (vitamin B6) as a cofactor. The history of consanguinity and similar symptoms in relatives suggests a possible genetic cause, such as X-linked sideroblastic anemia, which is also associated with pyridoxine deficiency. Therefore, the most likely substance deficient in this patient is pyridoxine.",9
7462,"The patient's symptoms and positive interferon-gamma assay suggest tuberculosis (TB), likely caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In TB, the bacteria are typically found within macrophages. In a lymph node, macrophages are primarily located in the medullary sinus. Therefore, the biopsy of the cervical lymph node is most likely to show the causal organism in the medullary sinus.",9
7460,"The patient presents with pruritus, fatigue, and laboratory findings suggestive of liver dysfunction. The key laboratory findings include elevated bilirubin, ALT, AST, and ALP levels. The positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) and antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) are particularly significant. AMA positivity is highly indicative of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), an autoimmune liver disease characterized by the destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts. The patient's history of alcohol use is noted, but the AMA positivity strongly points towards PBC rather than alcohol-related liver disease. The anti-HBs positivity indicates past vaccination or resolved infection, and the negative anti-HBc rules out current or past hepatitis B infection. The combination of symptoms, lab findings, and AMA positivity makes primary biliary cholangitis the most likely diagnosis.",9
7467,"The patient was started on an antihypertensive medication and subsequently developed 2+ pretibial edema bilaterally. This side effect is commonly associated with calcium channel blockers, particularly dihydropyridines like amlodipine. These medications can cause peripheral edema due to preferential dilation of precapillary vessels (arterioles) leading to increased hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries. Other medications listed, such as losartan (an angiotensin receptor blocker), prazosin (an alpha-1 blocker), and propranolol (a beta-blocker), are less likely to cause peripheral edema as a side effect. Therefore, the medication most likely responsible for the edema in this patient is amlodipine.",9
7466,"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome, which is caused by compression of the median nerve at the wrist. The symptoms include pain and paresthesias in the thumb, index, and middle fingers, and are often worse at night. The positive Tinel's sign (pain on percussion of the wrist) and Phalen's maneuver (pain on wrist flexion) further support this diagnosis. 

The initial management of carpal tunnel syndrome typically involves conservative measures. Splinting the wrist, especially at night, is often the first step as it helps to keep the wrist in a neutral position, reducing pressure on the median nerve. This can provide significant symptom relief. 

Corticosteroid injections can be considered if conservative measures fail, and surgical decompression is reserved for severe or refractory cases. NSAIDs may help with pain but do not address the underlying cause of nerve compression.

Therefore, the most appropriate initial step in management is splinting.",9
7475,"The patient is a 16-year-old boy presenting with symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder, including fatigue, anhedonia, concentration problems, low appetite, and insomnia. Importantly, he has expressed suicidal thoughts, although without a specific plan. In such cases, safety is a primary concern. Given the presence of firearms in the home, it is crucial to reduce access to means of self-harm. Therefore, instructing the parents to remove guns from the house is a critical step in ensuring the patient's safety. While family therapy, alcohol cessation, and hospitalization may be relevant considerations, the immediate priority is to mitigate the risk of suicide by addressing access to firearms.",9
7490,"The presence of macrophages with brown intracytoplasmic inclusions that turn purple with Prussian blue stain indicates hemosiderin-laden macrophages, also known as ""heart failure cells."" These are typically found in the lungs due to pulmonary congestion and edema, often secondary to left-sided heart failure. In left-sided heart failure, blood backs up into the pulmonary circulation, causing pulmonary congestion and edema. This can lead to symptoms such as orthopnea, which is shortness of breath that worsens when lying flat (supine). Therefore, the pathological process indicated by the presence of hemosiderin-laden macrophages in the lungs is consistent with heart failure, which manifests as shortness of breath that worsens when supine.",9
7489,"Valproic acid is known to be teratogenic and is associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, in the developing fetus. Spina bifida can lead to defects in the lower spine, which may require surgical intervention after birth. Therefore, the baby is at increased risk for conditions that might necessitate lower spinal surgery.",9
7492,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of hereditary hemochromatosis, including fatigue, hepatomegaly, hyperpigmented skin, and elevated iron studies (high serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation). The family history of liver cancer and the patient's diabetes and skin changes further support this suspicion. To confirm the diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis, genetic testing for the HFE gene mutation (most commonly C282Y) is the most appropriate next step.",9
7494,"The patient presents with signs and symptoms suggestive of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), a common complication in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. The fever, abdominal pain, altered mental status, and hypotension are indicative of an infection, likely SBP. In such cases, the best initial step is to perform a diagnostic paracentesis to confirm the diagnosis by analyzing the ascitic fluid for cell count, differential, and culture. This will help determine if there is an infection and guide appropriate antibiotic therapy. While empiric antibiotics are crucial in the management of SBP, the diagnostic paracentesis is necessary to confirm the diagnosis before starting treatment.",9
7501,"The clinical presentation of a 3-month-old with multiple bruises, retinal hemorrhages, and a subdural hemorrhage is highly suggestive of non-accidental trauma, commonly known as shaken baby syndrome. The presence of these findings, especially in such a young infant, raises significant concern for child abuse. In such cases, the most important step is to ensure the child's safety and well-being. Informing child protective services is crucial to investigate the situation further and to protect the child from potential harm. Other options, such as providing anticipatory guidance or reassurance, do not address the immediate concern of potential abuse. Referral to genetics is not relevant in this context as the findings are not suggestive of a genetic disorder.",9
7500,"The patient is 5 weeks post her last menstrual period (LMP), which means she is approximately 3 weeks post-conception. At this stage of embryonic development, the neural tube is forming, and the neural crest cells are differentiating. Limb buds typically begin to form around the 4th to 5th week post-conception. Therefore, at 3 weeks post-conception, the neural crest has formed, but limb buds have not yet formed.",9
7504,"In the nephron, the ascending limb of the loop of Henle is known for its unique property of being impermeable to water. This segment actively reabsorbs sodium, potassium, and chloride ions, which decreases the osmolality of the tubular fluid as it ascends. The impermeability to water prevents water from following the reabsorbed ions, leading to a dilution of the tubular fluid. This explains why the urine osmolality decreases from 1200 mOsmol/kg in the descending limb to 200 mOsmol/kg in the ascending limb. Therefore, the low osmolality in the ascending limb is due to its impermeability to water.",9
7506,"The patient is experiencing movement abnormalities, including involuntary blinking (blepharospasm), neck muscle spasms (cervical dystonia), and leg cramps. These symptoms are consistent with drug-induced extrapyramidal side effects, likely due to the use of metoclopramide, a dopamine receptor antagonist. Metoclopramide can cause dystonia and other extrapyramidal symptoms by blocking dopamine receptors in the central nervous system. The best treatment for these symptoms is an anticholinergic agent, which can help restore the balance between dopamine and acetylcholine in the brain. Benztropine is an anticholinergic drug commonly used to treat drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms. Therefore, the best treatment for this patient is benztropine.",9
7512,"The patient is a heavy smoker, consuming approximately 3 packs of cigarettes per day. Chronic exposure to cigarette smoke is known to cause changes in the bronchial epithelium. The normal bronchial epithelium is composed of ciliated columnar epithelial cells. Due to the irritant effect of cigarette smoke, these cells undergo a process called metaplasia, where the normal columnar epithelium is replaced by stratified squamous epithelium. This change is an adaptive response to the chronic irritation and is reversible if the irritant is removed. Dysplasia, on the other hand, would indicate a more disordered growth pattern that could potentially lead to cancer, but metaplasia is the initial change seen in response to smoking.",9
7522,"The patient has rheumatoid arthritis and is on antirheumatic drugs and hormone replacement therapy. The DEXA scan shows a T-score of -1.80, indicating osteopenia. Among the medications listed, prednisone is a glucocorticoid, which is known to cause decreased bone density and osteoporosis as a side effect. Glucocorticoids increase bone resorption and decrease bone formation, leading to bone loss. This makes prednisone the most likely drug involved in the pathogenesis of the decreased bone density observed in this patient.",9
7529,"The patient has a history of uncontrolled hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which are risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Her glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 30 mL/min indicates stage 3 CKD. In CKD, the kidneys are unable to excrete phosphate effectively, leading to hyperphosphatemia. Additionally, the kidneys have a reduced ability to convert vitamin D to its active form, leading to decreased calcium absorption from the gut and hypocalcemia. In response to low calcium levels, the parathyroid glands secrete more parathyroid hormone (PTH) to increase calcium levels, leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism. Therefore, the expected lab findings in this patient would be increased PTH, decreased calcium, and increased phosphate.",9
7536,"The patient's symptoms of runny nose, sneezing, and coughing persisting for months suggest a chronic condition, likely allergic rhinitis. The absence of fever, sinus tenderness, or oropharyngeal abnormalities makes an acute bacterial infection less likely, ruling out the need for antibiotics like amoxicillin. Intranasal saline can help with symptom relief but is not the most effective treatment for allergic rhinitis. Loratadine, an oral antihistamine, can help with allergic symptoms but is generally less effective than intranasal steroids for persistent symptoms. Intranasal steroids are the most effective treatment for controlling chronic allergic rhinitis symptoms by reducing inflammation in the nasal passages.",9
7544,"The patient is described as aloof, a loner, and detached, with a preference for solitary activities and no interest in social relationships or intimacy. He denies hallucinations or delusions, which rules out psychotic disorders. His behavior aligns with the characteristics of schizoid personality disorder, which includes a lack of interest in social relationships, a preference for solitary activities, and emotional coldness or detachment. Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by a desire for social relationships but avoidance due to fear of rejection, which does not fit this case. Schizotypal personality disorder involves eccentric behavior and odd beliefs, which are not described here. Autism spectrum disorder involves deficits in social communication and interaction, but the key features here align more closely with schizoid personality disorder.",9
7542,"The patient presents with a history of excessive bleeding after dental procedures, menorrhagia, and a family history of bleeding (mother with frequent nosebleeds). These symptoms suggest a bleeding disorder. The laboratory findings show a normal platelet count and a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), with normal prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR). This pattern is consistent with a defect in the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Hemophilia A is characterized by a deficiency in factor VIII, leading to prolonged aPTT, but it typically presents with deep tissue bleeding rather than mucosal bleeding. Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is characterized by mucosal bleeding, prolonged aPTT due to factor VIII stabilization issues, and often a family history of bleeding. The normal platelet count and prolonged aPTT, along with the clinical presentation, strongly suggest VWD. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can cause bleeding due to thrombocytopenia or antiphospholipid syndrome, but the platelet count is normal here. Sideroblastic anemia is unrelated to bleeding disorders and is characterized by microcytic anemia, which is not the primary issue here. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Von Willebrand disease.",9
7548,"The patient's symptoms of fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, fever, and lymphadenopathy suggest a possible hematologic malignancy. The lab test revealing a high concentration of a protein arranged in a pentameric complex indicates elevated IgM, which is characteristic of Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Waldenström's macroglobulinemia is associated with hyperviscosity syndrome, which can lead to retinal hemorrhage due to increased blood viscosity. Therefore, the most strongly associated finding with this condition is retinal hemorrhage.",9
7555,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), including bilateral wrist and finger joint pain, morning stiffness lasting more than an hour, and subcutaneous nodules (likely rheumatoid nodules). The acute management of RA flares typically involves the use of corticosteroids to quickly reduce inflammation and pain. Prednisolone, a corticosteroid, is effective for this purpose. Indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), could also be used for pain relief, but given the patient's history of peptic ulcer disease, corticosteroids are preferred to avoid gastrointestinal complications. Vitamin D and calcium supplements are not relevant for acute symptom management, and sulfasalazine is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) used for long-term management, not acute flares.",9
7559,"The child has a history of recurrent acute otitis media, with 8 episodes over the past 2 years. The otoscopic examination shows a white tympanic membrane with decreased mobility, indicating possible middle ear effusion or scarring. The lack of erythema or bulging suggests there is no acute infection currently. Given the frequency of episodes and the presence of a persistent middle ear effusion, the most appropriate intervention is myringotomy with insertion of a tympanostomy tube. This procedure helps ventilate the middle ear, prevent fluid accumulation, and reduce the frequency of infections. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not typically recommended due to concerns about resistance and side effects. Adenoidectomy is considered if there is evidence of nasal obstruction or recurrent sinusitis, which is not present here. Myringotomy without tube insertion would not address the underlying issue of recurrent effusions and infections.",9
7560,"The patient presents with sudden onset respiratory distress, hypotension, and decreased breath sounds on the right side, with tracheal deviation to the left. These findings are suggestive of a tension pneumothorax, likely on the right side. The tracheal deviation and hypotension indicate a significant shift of mediastinal structures, which is a medical emergency. In such cases, immediate intervention is required to relieve the pressure. The next best step is urgent needle decompression to relieve the tension pneumothorax. A chest X-ray would delay treatment and is not appropriate in this emergency situation. D-dimer levels and nebulization with albuterol are not relevant to the immediate management of a tension pneumothorax.",9
7556,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a diagnosis of pernicious anemia, which is an autoimmune condition leading to vitamin B12 deficiency due to the destruction of gastric parietal cells. This destruction results in atrophic gastritis, particularly affecting the gastric antrum, as noted in the endoscopy report. The presence of iron deficiency anemia and vitamin B12 deficiency further supports this diagnosis. In pernicious anemia, anti-parietal cell antibodies are commonly found. These antibodies target the parietal cells of the stomach, leading to their destruction and subsequent vitamin B12 deficiency due to lack of intrinsic factor production. Therefore, the test that would be expected to be positive in this patient is the anti-parietal cell antibodies test.",9
7563,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings are consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in a child, which is commonly associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus. The elevated blood glucose, elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate, and undetectable C-peptide indicate a lack of insulin production. The presence of antiglutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies suggests an autoimmune process. In type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, leading to insulin deficiency. Therefore, the underlying cause of this patient's condition is immune-mediated destruction of pancreatic beta cells.",9
7566,"The patient presents with fever, confusion, diaphoresis, muscle rigidity, and autonomic instability (elevated blood pressure and pulse). These symptoms, along with the use of haloperidol, suggest neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). NMS is a life-threatening condition associated with the use of antipsychotic medications, characterized by hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic dysregulation, and altered mental status. The elevated creatine kinase level supports muscle breakdown, which is consistent with NMS. Delirium tremens is unlikely due to the patient's minimal alcohol use. Herpes simplex encephalitis would present with focal neurological signs and possibly seizures, and bacterial meningitis would typically present with more pronounced neck stiffness and possibly a rash. The combination of symptoms and medication history strongly points to NMS.",9
7567,"In breast cancer, the prognosis is influenced by several factors. Age can be a factor, but it is not the most significant in this context. HER2 receptor status is important for treatment decisions, but not the most critical for prognosis in this case. Hormone receptor status (estrogen and progesterone) is positive, which generally indicates a better prognosis and response to hormone therapy. However, the most significant prognostic factor in breast cancer is the nodal status. The presence of micrometastasis in one axillary lymph node indicates some spread, which is crucial for determining prognosis. Therefore, nodal status has the greatest effect on prognosis.",9
7570,"The infant presents with limb deformities, low-set ears, and a flattened nose, which are characteristic features of Potter sequence. Potter sequence is caused by oligohydramnios, often due to renal agenesis or severe renal dysfunction, leading to insufficient amniotic fluid. This results in compression of the fetus, causing the noted physical deformities. The difficulty in maintaining oxygenation is likely due to pulmonary hypoplasia, another consequence of oligohydramnios. The most likely cause of these symptoms is cystic dilation of the collecting ducts in the kidney, which is associated with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). This condition leads to renal dysfunction and oligohydramnios, explaining the clinical presentation.",9
7583,"The patient is an adult and has the right to make decisions about her own body, including the decision to terminate a pregnancy. Informed consent is a critical part of this process, which involves explaining the procedure, its risks, benefits, and alternatives. The patient does not need consent from her legal guardians or the baby's father, as she is legally capable of making her own medical decisions. Therefore, the most appropriate step is to ensure she is fully informed about the procedure and its potential risks and effects.",9
7580,"The patient's symptoms of nausea and vomiting occurring 2 hours after eating leftover rice suggest a foodborne illness with a short incubation period. Bacillus cereus is known for causing food poisoning with a rapid onset of symptoms, particularly associated with reheated rice dishes. The emetic type of Bacillus cereus food poisoning is characterized by nausea and vomiting within 1-6 hours after ingestion, due to a preformed toxin. Staphylococcus aureus can also cause rapid-onset food poisoning, but it is more commonly associated with foods like dairy products, meats, and salads. Shigella dysenteriae and Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli typically have longer incubation periods and are associated with diarrhea rather than isolated nausea and vomiting. Therefore, the most likely causal organism in this scenario is Bacillus cereus.",9
7591,"The clinical presentation and microbiological characteristics suggest the causative agent is Vibrio cholerae. This bacterium is known for causing profuse watery diarrhea, often referred to as ""rice-water stools,"" and is common in areas with poor sanitation, such as parts of Central America. Vibrio cholerae is a gram-negative, oxidase-positive, comma-shaped bacterium that thrives in alkaline environments (pH > 8). The toxin produced by Vibrio cholerae is cholera toxin, which acts by ADP-ribosylating the Gs subunit of the G protein, leading to overactivation of adenylate cyclase. This results in increased levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in intestinal epithelial cells, causing massive secretion of water and electrolytes into the intestinal lumen, leading to watery diarrhea. Therefore, the mechanism of action of the toxin is overactivation of adenylate cyclase by activation of the Gs subunit by ADP-ribosylation.",10
7597,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a diagnosis of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). This condition is characterized by fatigue, jaundice, pruritus, and cholestatic liver enzyme pattern (elevated alkaline phosphatase and direct bilirubin). The absence of gallstones or biliary obstruction on imaging and ERCP supports this diagnosis. The mention of the patient's mother having a condition related to dryness of eyes and mouth suggests a possible autoimmune background, which is common in PBC. The most specific serological marker for PBC is the presence of anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA).",9
7600,"The patient's symptoms include acute agitation, bizarre behavior, withdrawal from activities, occupational dysfunction, and delusions of being spied on and mind control. These symptoms have been present for 3 months. 

- Schizoaffective disorder requires mood disorder symptoms concurrent with psychotic symptoms, which are not described here.
- Brief psychotic disorder lasts less than 1 month, so it is not applicable.
- Schizophreniform disorder is characterized by symptoms similar to schizophrenia but lasting more than 1 month and less than 6 months, which fits the 3-month duration here.
- Delusional disorder involves non-bizarre delusions without significant functional impairment or other psychotic symptoms, which does not match the patient's presentation.

Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis given the duration and symptoms is schizophreniform disorder.",9
7599,"The patient's symptoms include vision impairment in one eye, inability to distinguish colors, and pain with eye movement. These symptoms are characteristic of optic neuritis, which is inflammation of the optic nerve. The fact that she had a similar episode in the past that resolved spontaneously also supports this diagnosis. The normal CT scan and lack of abnormalities on slit lamp examination further suggest that the issue is not with the retina or anterior structures of the eye, but rather with the optic nerve. Retinal detachment typically presents with sudden vision loss and floaters, narrow-angle glaucoma with acute eye pain and halos, and macular degeneration with central vision loss, none of which match this presentation. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is optic neuritis.",9
7604,"The patient presents with bizarre delusions and negative symptoms such as flat affect and lack of interest in socializing, which have been present intermittently for at least 1 month over the past year. These symptoms have significantly impaired his ability to maintain employment and social relationships. The absence of mood disorder symptoms rules out schizoaffective disorder. Schizotypal and schizoid personality disorders do not typically involve the presence of psychotic symptoms such as delusions. The duration and nature of the symptoms are consistent with schizophrenia, which involves both positive symptoms (delusions) and negative symptoms (flat affect, social withdrawal) for a significant portion of time over a 6-month period, including at least 1 month of active symptoms.",9
7601,"In a first prenatal visit, routine screening for certain infections is recommended for all pregnant women regardless of their perceived risk factors. According to guidelines, all pregnant women should be screened for syphilis and HIV as part of standard prenatal care. Additionally, screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) is also recommended to prevent perinatal transmission. Screening for chlamydia is generally recommended for women under 25 or those at increased risk, but it is not universally required for all pregnant women. Therefore, the most appropriate infections to screen for in this patient include syphilis, HIV, and HBV.",9
7612,"The clinical scenario describes a child with severe pneumonia who develops sudden hypotension, fever, tachycardia, and warm extremities, which are indicative of septic shock. The mention of a bacterial toxin suggests the involvement of endotoxins or exotoxins that can lead to septic shock. In septic shock, particularly due to Gram-negative bacteria, endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides) can trigger the release of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), leading to vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and hypotension. The warm extremities and fever are consistent with distributive shock, where peripheral vasodilation occurs. Therefore, the mechanism of action of the toxin most likely involved is the release of TNF, which is a key mediator in the pathogenesis of septic shock.",9
7608,"The patient's biopsy shows large cells with abundant clear cytoplasm, which is characteristic of clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina. This type of cancer is strongly associated with in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES), a synthetic estrogen that was prescribed to pregnant women between the 1940s and 1970s to prevent miscarriages and other pregnancy complications. The patient's age and the histological findings suggest this diagnosis. Other risk factors such as alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and family history of breast and ovarian cancer are not directly linked to clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina. Therefore, the most significant risk factor for this diagnosis is DES exposure in utero.",9
7628,"Digoxin toxicity is known to cause hyperkalemia. This is because digoxin inhibits the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, leading to an increase in intracellular sodium and a decrease in intracellular potassium. As a result, potassium accumulates in the extracellular space, causing hyperkalemia. In cases of acute digoxin toxicity, hyperkalemia is a common finding and can be a marker of the severity of the toxicity.",9
7624,"The combination of findings in this case suggests a high risk for Down syndrome (Trisomy 21). The hypoplastic nasal bone, along with the maternal serum markers (low α-fetoprotein, low estriol, high inhibin A, and high β-hCG), are indicative of Down syndrome. Physical examination of an infant with Down syndrome often reveals a single transverse palmar crease, among other features such as hypotonia, epicanthic folds, and a flat facial profile.",9
7618,"The patient is a 1-month-old girl presenting with scleral icterus and dark urine, indicating jaundice. The laboratory results show elevated total bilirubin with a significant portion being direct (conjugated) bilirubin (3.8 mg/dL out of 4.6 mg/dL total). This suggests conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

In newborns, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia can be due to obstruction of the biliary tree or liver disease. The options provided include:

A. Increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin - This typically causes unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, not conjugated.

B. Increased production of bilirubin - This would also lead to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

C. Obstruction of the extrahepatic biliary tree - This can cause conjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to bile flow obstruction, leading to jaundice and dark urine.

D. Obstruction of the intrahepatic biliary tree - This can also cause conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, but in a 1-month-old, extrahepatic causes like biliary atresia are more common.

Given the age and presentation, obstruction of the extrahepatic biliary tree, such as biliary atresia, is the most likely diagnosis.",9
7627,"The patient's chronic dry cough began after starting with a new primary care physician, suggesting a possible link to a new medication. Given her history of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, she might have been prescribed an ACE inhibitor, which is known to cause a dry cough as a side effect. Therefore, reviewing her medication list is the most logical first step to identify any potential drug-related causes of her cough.",9
7629,"The patient is experiencing lactic acidosis, as indicated by the elevated lactate level and the metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory acidosis (low pH, low HCO3-, and elevated pCO2). Among the medications listed, zidovudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) known to cause mitochondrial toxicity, which can lead to lactic acidosis. The macrocytic anemia (elevated MCV) and leukopenia are also consistent with zidovudine's side effects. Therefore, the drug responsible for these findings is zidovudine, which is an NRTI.",9
7635,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a cranial nerve III (oculomotor nerve) palsy, which is characterized by the eye being 'down and out' due to unopposed action of the lateral rectus and superior oblique muscles. The fact that the pupil is not mentioned as being affected suggests a pupil-sparing third nerve palsy, which is often due to microvascular ischemia related to diabetes mellitus. In such cases, the parasympathetic fibers that control the pupil are spared, leading to normal pupil size and reactivity. However, ptosis is a common feature of oculomotor nerve palsy due to paralysis of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle. Therefore, further evaluation is most likely to show ptosis.",9
7639,"The susceptibility to infections by catalase-producing organisms suggests a defect in the oxidative burst mechanism of phagocytic cells. Catalase-positive organisms can neutralize hydrogen peroxide, which is a key component of the reactive oxygen species used by phagocytes to kill bacteria. Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a condition where there is a defect in the NADPH oxidase complex in neutrophils, leading to impaired production of reactive oxygen species. This results in increased susceptibility to infections by catalase-positive organisms. Therefore, the problem is with the function of neutrophils.",10
7637,"The patient presents with symptoms of vaginal fullness, lower back and pelvic pain, and a protrusion of the posterior vaginal wall on Valsalva maneuver. These symptoms are suggestive of pelvic organ prolapse. Given her history of hysterectomy, the protrusion of the posterior vaginal wall is likely due to an enterocele, which is a herniation of the small intestine into the vaginal canal. The decreased pelvic floor muscle and anal sphincter tone further support a diagnosis of pelvic organ prolapse. The other options do not fit the clinical presentation: Bartholin gland cyst would present as a localized swelling, atrophic vaginitis would cause dryness and irritation, and infectious vulvovaginitis would present with signs of infection.",9
7643,"The patient is presenting with confusion, fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxemia on post-operative day 5. These symptoms suggest a systemic inflammatory response. The presence of coarse crackles in the right lung base indicates a possible pulmonary infection, such as pneumonia, which is a common post-operative complication. The combination of systemic inflammatory response and a likely source of infection (pneumonia) fits the criteria for sepsis. Non-infectious SIRS would not have an identifiable source of infection, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome would involve dysfunction of multiple organ systems, which is not evident here. Drug-induced fever is less likely given the respiratory findings and systemic response.",9
7641,"The newborn presents with jaundice, scleral icterus, and mild hepatosplenomegaly one day after birth. The laboratory findings show anemia (hemoglobin 10.7 mg/dL) and an elevated reticulocyte count (3.5%), indicating hemolysis. The mother is blood group O, Rh-negative, and has a positive anti-Rh antibody titer, while the newborn is blood group A, Rh-negative. This suggests that the mother has developed antibodies against the fetal blood group antigens. However, since both mother and child are Rh-negative, Rh incompatibility is not the issue. Instead, the mother likely has anti-A antibodies (IgG type) that have crossed the placenta and are causing hemolysis in the newborn, leading to jaundice. This is a case of ABO incompatibility, which is common when the mother is blood group O and the child is either A or B. Therefore, the most likely cause of the newborn's condition is the transfer of maternal anti-A antibodies.",9
7645,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest Paget's disease of bone. This condition is characterized by abnormal bone remodeling, where there is an initial phase of increased osteoclastic bone resorption. This is followed by a compensatory increase in osteoblastic activity, leading to disorganized bone formation. The elevated alkaline phosphatase level is indicative of increased osteoblastic activity, but the initial trigger is the increased activity of osteoclasts. Therefore, the cells initially responsible for this condition are osteoclasts.",9
7648,"The brother's symptoms suggest Kartagener syndrome, which is a form of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). This is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by situs inversus, chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis. Since the brother is affected, both parents are likely carriers of the disease. The woman has a 2/3 chance of being a carrier because she is unaffected (1/4 chance of being affected, 1/2 chance of being a carrier, and 1/4 chance of being unaffected). The intended father is assumed to be from the general population, where the carrier frequency can be calculated from the prevalence (1 in 40,000) using the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The carrier frequency (q) is the square root of the prevalence, which is approximately 1/200. The probability that the child will be affected is the probability that both parents are carriers (2/3 for the woman and 1/200 for the man) multiplied by the probability that two carriers will have an affected child (1/4). Therefore, the chance is (2/3) * (1/200) * (1/4) = 1/1200, which is approximately 0.08%. This is closest to 0.2% among the given options.",9
7652,"The patient presents with pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia, and a recent history of air travel, which raises suspicion for a pulmonary embolism (PE). Her vital signs are stable, and she is not hypoxic, which suggests she is not in immediate danger. The Well's criteria for PE would likely indicate an intermediate probability given her symptoms and recent travel. In such cases, a D-dimer test is often used to rule out PE in patients with low to intermediate pre-test probability. If the D-dimer is negative, PE is unlikely, and further imaging may not be necessary. If positive, further imaging such as a CT angiogram would be warranted. Therefore, the most appropriate next test is a D-dimer.",9
7656,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many people have an LDL cholesterol level less than 300 mg/dL in a normally distributed population with a mean of 200 mg/dL and a standard deviation of 50 mg/dL.

First, we calculate the z-score for 300 mg/dL using the formula:

z = (X - μ) / σ

where X is the value of interest (300 mg/dL), μ is the mean (200 mg/dL), and σ is the standard deviation (50 mg/dL).

z = (300 - 200) / 50 = 100 / 50 = 2

Next, we look up the z-score of 2 in the standard normal distribution table. A z-score of 2 corresponds to approximately 0.9772, meaning 97.72% of the population has an LDL level less than 300 mg/dL.

Finally, we calculate the number of people with LDL less than 300 mg/dL by multiplying the total number of participants (1000) by 0.9772:

1000 * 0.9772 = 977.2

Since we cannot have a fraction of a person, we round to the nearest whole number, which is 975.

Therefore, the number of people with cholesterol less than 300 mg/dL is 975.",10
7662,"The symptoms and culture results indicate an infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a Gram-negative glucose-fermenting, non-maltose fermenting diplococcus. In a child, the presence of this organism is highly suggestive of sexual abuse, as gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection. The physician has a legal and ethical obligation to report suspected child abuse to the appropriate authorities. Therefore, the next step is to contact Child Protective Services to ensure the child's safety and initiate an investigation.",9
7661,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), given her acute confusion, weakness, and speech difficulties that resolved within a short period. Her risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and notably, atrial fibrillation (AF), as indicated by the irregular pulse and ECG findings of irregularly spaced QRS complexes without discernible P waves. AF increases the risk of embolic strokes due to the formation of thrombi in the left atrium. The mild carotid stenosis is unlikely to be the primary cause of her symptoms. To prevent future embolic events, anticoagulation therapy is indicated. Warfarin is a common anticoagulant used to prevent thromboembolic events in patients with AF. Enalapril is an antihypertensive, alteplase is a thrombolytic used in acute stroke management, and aortic valve replacement is not indicated based on the current findings. Therefore, the best treatment to prevent future neurologic events in this patient is anticoagulation with warfarin.",9
7659,"The patient presents with a malodorous gray vaginal discharge and a vaginal pH of 5.0. These findings are suggestive of bacterial vaginosis (BV). BV is characterized by a thin, gray discharge with a fishy odor, and the vaginal pH is typically greater than 4.5. The most common organism associated with BV is Gardnerella vaginalis. The absence of pain or pruritus also supports the diagnosis of BV rather than a yeast infection or sexually transmitted infection. Microscopic examination in BV typically shows clue cells, which are epithelial cells covered with bacteria. Given these findings, Gardnerella vaginalis is the most likely causal organism.",9
7676,"The patient likely suffered a myocardial infarction (MI) four days prior to his death, given the sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath. The new systolic murmur suggests a complication such as papillary muscle rupture or ventricular septal defect, which can occur a few days after an MI. The timeline of four days post-MI is crucial for determining the histological changes in the myocardium. 

In the first 24 hours after an MI, coagulative necrosis begins, and wavy fibers may be seen. By 1-3 days, coagulative necrosis is more pronounced with neutrophilic infiltration. By 3-7 days, macrophages begin to appear, and granulation tissue starts to form. By 7-10 days, granulation tissue is more prominent, and macrophages are abundant, clearing necrotic debris.

Given that the patient died four days after the MI, the myocardium would most likely show hyperemic granulation tissue with an abundance of macrophages, as this corresponds to the 3-7 day period post-MI.",9
7678,"The patient is presenting with severe abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and abdominal distension with rebound tenderness. These symptoms, along with her history of ulcerative colitis, suggest a possible complication such as toxic megacolon. In this scenario, it is crucial to quickly assess for colonic dilation and potential perforation. A plain abdominal radiograph is the most appropriate initial imaging study to evaluate for toxic megacolon, as it can quickly show colonic dilation and free air if perforation has occurred. Other options like CT or contrast enema are not the immediate next steps due to the urgency and potential risk of perforation.",9
7675,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is involved in several cellular processes, particularly the rough ER, which is studded with ribosomes and is crucial for the synthesis of proteins destined for secretion, membrane insertion, or lysosomal targeting. The removal of a gene that facilitates ribosome binding to the ER would specifically impair the rough ER's ability to synthesize these proteins. Secretory proteins are synthesized by ribosomes attached to the rough ER, so if ribosome binding is impaired, the production of secretory proteins would be affected. The other options involve processes not directly related to ribosome binding to the ER: synthesis of ketone bodies occurs in the liver mitochondria, α-oxidation of fatty acids occurs in peroxisomes, and ubiquitination of proteins is a cytosolic process. Therefore, the most likely impaired process is the production of secretory proteins.",9
7667,"The patient is experiencing symptoms consistent with social anxiety disorder, particularly related to performance situations such as giving presentations. His symptoms include palpitations, sweating, flushing, racing thoughts, and fear of embarrassment, which are typical of social anxiety. The most appropriate first-line treatment for social anxiety disorder is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which focuses on changing the thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to the anxiety. While medications like SSRIs or benzodiazepines can be used, CBT is preferred as the initial approach, especially given the patient's young age and the situational nature of his anxiety. Olanzapine is an antipsychotic and not indicated here, and buspirone is not typically used for social anxiety disorder. Lorazepam, a benzodiazepine, could be used for acute anxiety but is not the best long-term solution due to potential dependency issues.",9
7696,"The 10-day-old boy presents with bilateral breast enlargement and discharge, which is a common and benign condition known as neonatal gynecomastia. This occurs due to the influence of maternal hormones (estrogens) that cross the placenta during pregnancy. The condition is self-limiting and typically resolves on its own without intervention. The presence of inverted nipples and the family history of breast cancer are not relevant to this benign neonatal condition. Given the age of the patient and the typical presentation, the most appropriate management is reassurance to the parents that this is a normal physiological process.",9
7680,"The question asks for a receptor that is both voltage-gated and ligand-gated. 

- **GABAA receptor**: This is a ligand-gated ion channel, primarily allowing chloride ions to pass through when activated by GABA. It is not voltage-gated.

- **Glycine receptor**: Similar to the GABAA receptor, this is a ligand-gated chloride channel activated by glycine, and it is not voltage-gated.

- **NMDA receptor**: This receptor is unique because it requires both ligand binding (glutamate and glycine) and membrane depolarization to remove the magnesium block, allowing calcium and sodium ions to flow through. Thus, it is both ligand-gated and voltage-gated.

- **Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor**: This is a ligand-gated ion channel activated by acetylcholine, allowing sodium and potassium ions to pass through. It is not voltage-gated.

The NMDA receptor is the only one that fits the description of being both voltage-gated and ligand-gated.",10
7682,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of Klinefelter syndrome, which is characterized by the presence of an extra X chromosome in males (47, XXY). The key features include tall stature, gynecomastia, small testes, reduced facial hair, and infertility due to hypogonadism. The developmental delay and difficulties in school also align with this condition. Trisomy 13 and Trisomy 21 are associated with different syndromes (Patau and Down syndrome, respectively) and do not match the clinical presentation. 45, XO is Turner syndrome, which affects females.",9
7700,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of multiple myeloma, including anemia, hypercalcemia, renal impairment, and osteolytic bone lesions. The serum immunoelectrophoresis shows an IgG monoclonal component, and the bone marrow has 20% plasma cells, supporting this diagnosis. In multiple myeloma, renal impairment is commonly due to the precipitation of light chains in the renal tubules, leading to cast nephropathy. However, the question asks for the most common cause of the acute renal condition, which in this context is often exacerbated by hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia can cause renal vasoconstriction, decreased glomerular filtration rate, and direct tubular toxicity, contributing to acute kidney injury. While NSAIDs can also cause renal impairment, the hypercalcemia is more directly related to the pathophysiology of multiple myeloma and is a more common cause of renal issues in this condition.",9
7707,"The scenario describes a case of allergic asthma, likely triggered by pollen, which is common in spring. The initial immune response to an antigen typically involves IgM production. Over time, the immune system undergoes a process to produce IgE, which is associated with allergic reactions. This change from IgM to IgE is due to isotype switching, a process where B cells change the class of antibody they produce without altering the antigen specificity. This isotype switching is facilitated by cytokines and involves recombination at the DNA level in the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene locus. The other options do not describe this process: junctional diversity refers to the variability introduced during V(D)J recombination, affinity maturation involves the selection of B cells with higher affinity antibodies, and somatic hypermutation introduces mutations in the variable region of the antibody genes to increase affinity.",9
7704,"The clinical presentation and urinalysis findings are suggestive of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). The key features include cola-colored urine, facial puffiness, hypertension, and a history of a sore throat 3 weeks prior, which is consistent with a recent streptococcal infection. The urinalysis shows RBC casts and mild proteinuria, which are indicative of glomerulonephritis. In PSGN, light microscopy typically shows hypercellular and enlarged glomeruli due to proliferation of endothelial and mesangial cells and infiltration by inflammatory cells. This is the characteristic finding for PSGN.",9
7716,"Prevalence is the total number of cases of a disease in a population at a given time, while incidence is the number of new cases that develop in a specific time period. If the incidence of breast cancer has remained stable but the prevalence has increased, it suggests that people are living longer with the disease. This is likely due to improved treatment, which allows patients to survive longer after diagnosis, thus increasing the number of people living with the disease at any given time. Improved screening (option C) would likely increase both incidence and prevalence, as more cases would be detected earlier. Increased awareness (option A) and increased average age (option B) would also likely affect incidence. Therefore, the best explanation for stable incidence but increased prevalence is improved treatment.",9
7720,"The patient is likely experiencing digoxin toxicity, as digoxin is a cardiac glycoside that inhibits the sodium-potassium ATPase pump in cardiac myocytes. This can lead to symptoms such as gastrointestinal disturbances (vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia), neurological symptoms (headache), and cardiac issues (ventricular dysrhythmias). A classic symptom of digoxin toxicity is changes in color vision, particularly xanthopsia (yellow vision). The other options, such as bronchoconstriction, decreased PR interval, and cough, are not typically associated with digoxin toxicity.",9
7721,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), including frequent urination, nocturia, difficulty initiating urination, weak stream, and terminal dribbling. The rectal exam shows a smooth, symmetrically enlarged prostate, and PSA is normal, which supports the diagnosis of BPH. The postvoid residual volume of 110 mL indicates incomplete bladder emptying, which is common in BPH. The most appropriate initial management for symptomatic BPH is an alpha-1 blocker, such as terazosin, which helps relax the smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, improving urine flow and reducing symptoms. Finasteride is another option but is typically used for long-term management and takes longer to show effects. Bladder catheterization is not indicated unless there is acute urinary retention. Cystoscopy is not needed at this stage as there are no indications of complications or other underlying conditions.",9
7725,"The patient's symptoms of fever, nausea/vomiting, severe left flank pain, and costovertebral angle tenderness are indicative of acute pyelonephritis, a bacterial infection of the kidney. In acute pyelonephritis, the infection leads to an inflammatory response characterized by the infiltration of neutrophils into the renal interstitium and tubules. On histology, this is seen as neutrophils filling the lumens of the renal tubules. The other options describe findings associated with different renal pathologies: thickening of the capillaries and glomerular basement membrane is seen in diabetic nephropathy, scarring of the glomeruli is seen in chronic glomerulonephritis, and enlarged, hypercellular glomeruli with 'wire-looping' of capillaries are seen in lupus nephritis.",9
7718,"The patient presents with acute onset of shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, and hypoxemia following recent surgery and prolonged bed rest. These symptoms, along with the swelling and tenderness in the right calf, suggest a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) that has embolized to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism (PE). The CTPA showing a partial intraluminal filling defect supports the presence of a thrombus in the pulmonary vasculature. This is consistent with option D, which describes a trapped thrombus in the pulmonary vasculature, the mechanism of a PE.",9
7740,"The patient is a young woman with increasing pain and swelling in her right foot, specifically over the fifth metatarsal shaft. The pain is exacerbated by pushing the fifth toe inwards. She has no history of trauma, but she regularly wears stilettos and has been training for a marathon, both of which can contribute to repetitive stress on the foot. The presentation is consistent with a stress fracture, which is common in athletes and individuals who engage in repetitive activities that put stress on the bones. Acute osteomyelitis is less likely without systemic symptoms or a history of infection. Plantar fasciitis typically presents with heel pain, not forefoot pain. Freiberg disease affects the metatarsal head, usually the second metatarsal, not the shaft of the fifth metatarsal.",9
7728,"The clinical presentation and histological findings are key to diagnosing this condition. The description of a ""bunch of grapes"" appearance protruding from the vagina is characteristic of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, specifically the botryoid variant. This type of tumor is common in young children and presents as a polypoid mass. The histological finding of atypical stromal cells positive for desmin, a muscle marker, supports the diagnosis of a sarcoma, particularly rhabdomyosarcoma, which is a type of soft tissue sarcoma. The other options, such as verrucous carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma, do not fit the age group, clinical presentation, or histological findings described.",9
7745,"Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic medication commonly used to treat schizophrenia. While it is effective in managing symptoms, it is associated with several adverse effects. One of the most notable side effects of olanzapine is metabolic syndrome, which includes weight gain, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia. Dyslipidemia, in particular, is a common adverse effect due to olanzapine's impact on lipid metabolism. Seizures are more commonly associated with clozapine, another atypical antipsychotic. Agranulocytosis is a rare but serious side effect primarily linked to clozapine as well. Myoglobinuria is not typically associated with olanzapine use. Therefore, the most likely adverse effect this patient would experience from olanzapine is dyslipidemia.",9
7747,"The patient presents with progressive shortness of breath, dry cough, and physical findings of fine inspiratory crackles and digital clubbing. The chest X-ray shows peripheral reticular opacities and traction bronchiectasis, predominantly at the lung bases. The pulmonary function tests indicate a restrictive pattern with decreased FEV1 and FVC but a preserved FEV1/FVC ratio. These findings are consistent with interstitial lung disease. The high-resolution CT scan likely shows honeycombing and reticular patterns, which are characteristic of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The patient's age, symptoms, and imaging findings align with IPF rather than the other options. Pulmonary embolism would present acutely with different imaging findings, COPD would show an obstructive pattern on PFTs, and Chlamydia pneumoniae would present with different clinical and imaging features.",9
7766,"The patient presents with a pattern of neurological deficits that suggest Brown-Séquard syndrome, which occurs due to hemisection of the spinal cord. The key features include ipsilateral (same side) loss of motor function and proprioception/vibration sense, and contralateral (opposite side) loss of pain and temperature sensation. In this case, the patient has muscle weakness and impaired proprioception/vibration in the left leg, indicating damage to the left side of the spinal cord affecting the corticospinal tract and dorsal columns. The loss of pain and temperature sensation in the right leg indicates damage to the spinothalamic tract, which crosses to the opposite side a few segments above the entry point. Therefore, the left hemicord is the most likely section of the spinal cord that was damaged.",10
7762,"The clinical presentation of fever, rash, and oral lesions in a 2-year-old child suggests a viral exanthem. The presence of papules on the hands, feet, and trunk, along with oral lesions, is characteristic of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). HFMD is commonly caused by Coxsackievirus, particularly Coxsackievirus A16 and Enterovirus 71. The decreased muscle strength in the lower limbs could be related to the viral infection affecting the nervous system, which can occur with enteroviruses. Herpes simplex virus typically causes vesicular lesions and is less likely to present with this distribution. Cytomegalovirus and Parvovirus B19 have different clinical presentations and are less likely to cause this combination of symptoms. Therefore, the most likely causal organism is Coxsackievirus.",9
7763,"The patient's symptoms include right-sided hemiparesis, loss of vibration and proprioception, and a deviated tongue to the left. These findings suggest a lesion in the medial medulla. The right-sided hemiparesis and loss of vibration and proprioception indicate involvement of the corticospinal tract and medial lemniscus, respectively, which are located in the medial medulla. The deviation of the tongue to the left suggests involvement of the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII), which is also located in the medial medulla. These findings are consistent with Dejerine syndrome, also known as medial medullary syndrome.",9
7771,"The study finds that the overall relative risk (RR) of Barrett esophagus is increased in smokers compared to non-smokers. However, when stratified by the presence or absence of acid reflux, the association between smoking and Barrett esophagus disappears in both groups. This suggests that the initial association observed in the overall analysis was due to the presence of acid reflux, which is a confounding factor. Confounding occurs when the association between an exposure and an outcome is distorted by a third variable that is related to both the exposure and the outcome. In this case, acid reflux is related to both smoking and Barrett esophagus, and when the data is stratified by acid reflux, the association between smoking and Barrett esophagus is no longer present, indicating confounding.",9
7774,"The clinical scenario describes a 6-week-old infant with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), as indicated by the positive physical exam findings (hip dislocates posteriorly with adduction and depression of a flexed femur) and ultrasound showing acetabular dysplasia and dislocation. In infants younger than 6 months with DDH, the Pavlik harness is the first-line treatment. It is a dynamic splint that holds the hips in flexion and abduction, allowing for proper development of the acetabulum and femoral head. Closed reduction and spica casting are typically reserved for older infants or when the Pavlik harness is unsuccessful. Observation is not appropriate given the dislocation, and physiotherapy is not the primary treatment for DDH.",9
7778,"The newborn presents with features suggestive of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), which includes macrosomia, macroglossia, midfacial hypoplasia, hemihyperplasia, and an omphalocele. The enlarged kidneys and liver are also consistent with this diagnosis. BWS is associated with an increased risk of embryonal tumors, particularly Wilms tumor and hepatoblastoma. Therefore, regular surveillance for these tumors is recommended. Serial abdominal ultrasonography is used to monitor for Wilms tumor, which is a common practice in managing patients with BWS.",9
7768,"The clinical presentation and sputum culture findings are consistent with active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). The standard treatment for TB includes a combination of antibiotics, typically isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Isoniazid, one of the primary drugs used in TB treatment, can cause peripheral neuropathy as a side effect due to its interference with vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) metabolism. To prevent this side effect, pyridoxine supplementation is recommended for patients receiving isoniazid, especially those who may be at higher risk for deficiency, such as individuals with poor nutritional status or certain genetic predispositions. Therefore, pyridoxine must be included in the treatment regimen for this patient.",10
7781,"The patient is a 13-year-old male with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who has developed a fever and severe neutropenia (leukocyte count <500 /mm^3). This clinical scenario is concerning for febrile neutropenia, a potentially life-threatening condition that requires prompt management. The most appropriate initial management for febrile neutropenia is the administration of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics to cover for potential bacterial infections, especially gram-negative organisms. IV ceftazidime is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacteria, making it an appropriate choice for initial empirical therapy in febrile neutropenia. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) can be used to stimulate white blood cell production but is not the immediate treatment for febrile neutropenia. Oral antibiotics are not appropriate in this setting due to the severity of the condition and the need for rapid action.",9
7782,"The patient's symptoms are indicative of panic attacks, which are characterized by sudden episodes of intense fear and physical symptoms such as palpitations and fainting. These attacks are often triggered by situations like crowded places, suggesting a component of agoraphobia. For acute management of panic attacks, benzodiazepines are commonly used due to their rapid onset of action. Clonazepam, a benzodiazepine, is effective for immediate relief of anxiety symptoms. Other options like bupropion and metoprolol are not suitable for acute management of panic attacks. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker used for hypertension and not indicated for panic attacks.",9
7786,"The patient presents with symptoms and findings highly suggestive of active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), including a history of travel to an endemic area, systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss), respiratory symptoms (cough, shortness of breath), and radiographic findings (hilar enlargement and infiltrate). The presence of acid-fast bacilli in the sputum and a positive PCR test further support the diagnosis of TB. In cases of suspected active TB, especially with positive acid-fast bacilli and PCR, it is crucial to start treatment promptly to prevent transmission and progression of the disease. Awaiting culture results is not appropriate as it delays treatment. An interferon-γ release assay is not needed for diagnosis in this context, and a CT scan would not change the immediate management. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to initiate the standard treatment regimen for TB, which includes isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampin for 4 months.",9
7789,"The infant presents with recurrent nonbilious vomiting after feeding and a palpable epigastric mass, which is classic for hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. This condition typically occurs in infants around 3-12 weeks of age and is characterized by hypertrophy of the pylorus, leading to gastric outlet obstruction. The most appropriate diagnostic test is an abdominal ultrasound, which would show an elongated and thickened pylorus. 

- Option A (High serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentration) is associated with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, not pyloric stenosis.
- Option B (Dilated colon segment on abdominal x-ray) is indicative of Hirschsprung disease.
- Option D (Corkscrew sign on upper gastrointestinal contrast series) is associated with malrotation with volvulus.

Therefore, the correct answer is C, as it directly relates to the findings expected in pyloric stenosis.",9
7787,"The child fell on an outstretched arm, which is a common mechanism for a supracondylar humerus fracture. The presence of crepitus above the elbow suggests a fracture in that area. The inability to make the ""OK"" sign and decreased sensation along the thumb indicate median nerve involvement, which is commonly associated with supracondylar humerus fractures due to its proximity to the fracture site. The normal pulses and lack of compartment swelling suggest that there is no vascular compromise or compartment syndrome at this time. The ability to flex and extend the wrist, albeit limited by pain, further supports that the injury is proximal to the wrist, ruling out a distal radius fracture. A midhumerus fracture would more likely affect the radial nerve, leading to wrist drop, which is not observed here. A scaphoid fracture would not cause the symptoms described, particularly the median nerve involvement.",9
7804,"The patient presents with primary amenorrhea, lack of pubic hair, hypertension, and hypokalemia. These findings suggest a disorder of steroidogenesis. The lack of secondary sexual characteristics and hypertension point towards a deficiency that affects sex steroid production and causes mineralocorticoid excess.

In 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency, there is impaired production of sex steroids and cortisol, leading to increased production of mineralocorticoids (causing hypertension and hypokalemia). The lack of sex steroids results in primary amenorrhea and lack of secondary sexual characteristics, such as pubic hair.

The hypertension and hypokalemia are due to excess mineralocorticoid activity, which fits the lab findings and clinical presentation. The consanguinity of the parents increases the likelihood of an autosomal recessive condition, such as 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency.",9
7801,"The patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder, including insomnia, weight loss, fatigue, and feelings of guilt. She was started on fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), which typically takes 4-6 weeks to show significant improvement in depressive symptoms. At the 2-week follow-up, it is expected that there may not be significant improvement yet. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to continue the current medication and allow more time for it to take effect.",9
7803,"The patient presents with diffuse muscle aches, decreased BMI and height, and a depressed affect. Her lab results show low calcium (8.0 mg/dL), low phosphorus (2.6 mg/dL), and very high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (855 pg/mL). These findings suggest a condition related to bone metabolism.

Osteopenia and osteoporosis are characterized by decreased bone density, but they do not typically present with low calcium and phosphorus levels or elevated PTH. Hyperparathyroidism usually presents with high calcium levels, not low.

Osteomalacia is characterized by defective bone mineralization, often due to vitamin D deficiency, leading to low calcium and phosphorus levels and secondary hyperparathyroidism (elevated PTH) as the body tries to compensate for low calcium. The patient's symptoms and lab findings are consistent with osteomalacia.",9
7818,"The patient is being treated with valganciclovir for cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis. Valganciclovir is known to cause bone marrow suppression, leading to pancytopenia, which includes anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's current antiretroviral therapy includes zidovudine, lamivudine, and dolutegravir. Zidovudine is also associated with bone marrow suppression, particularly anemia. The combination of valganciclovir and zidovudine increases the risk of pancytopenia due to their additive effects on bone marrow suppression. The other options, such as hyperglycemia, abnormal dreams, and hepatic steatosis, are not as directly related to the combination of these medications as pancytopenia is.",9
7824,"The patient has a history of aggressive squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, which is known to metastasize to bones, among other sites. The technetium bone scan shows metastatic lesions in the lumbar vertebrae. Lung cancer, particularly squamous cell carcinoma, typically spreads to distant sites via the bloodstream, as it is a common route for metastasis of solid tumors. Hematogenous spread involves cancer cells entering the bloodstream and traveling to distant organs or bones, which aligns with the findings in this patient. Lymphatic spread is more common for regional spread, and transcoelomic spread is associated with cancers spreading across body cavities, such as peritoneal spread in ovarian cancer. Collagenase production is a mechanism for local invasion rather than distant metastasis.",9
7820,"The newborn is preterm at 31 weeks' gestation and has developed respiratory distress shortly after birth. The symptoms include nasal flaring, expiratory grunting, and tachypnea, which are indicative of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). In preterm infants, RDS is commonly caused by surfactant deficiency because surfactant production typically increases after 34 weeks of gestation. The chest x-ray in such cases often shows a ground-glass appearance and air bronchograms, which are characteristic of surfactant deficiency. Other options like pulmonary hypertension, impaired ciliary function, and delayed resorption of lung fluid are less likely given the gestational age and typical presentation of RDS in preterm infants.",9
7828,"The patient presents with fatigue, dysphagia for solids, and choking spells. The laboratory findings show microcytic anemia (low hemoglobin, low red cell count, low MCV) and low serum ferritin, indicating iron deficiency anemia. The barium swallow study reveals a proximal esophageal web. These findings are characteristic of Plummer-Vinson syndrome, which is a triad of iron deficiency anemia, esophageal webs, and dysphagia. The other options do not fit the combination of symptoms and findings as well as Plummer-Vinson syndrome does.",9
7829,"The patient is experiencing hoarseness after thyroid surgery, which is a common sign of recurrent laryngeal nerve damage. This nerve is responsible for innervating the vocal cords, and its injury can lead to vocal changes. In this scenario, the ethical and professional response is to be honest and transparent with the patient about the complication that occurred during surgery. This aligns with the principles of informed consent and patient autonomy, ensuring that the patient is fully aware of any adverse events that may affect their health. Therefore, the surgeon should inform the patient about the mistake and its potential impact.",9
7830,"The patient's presentation is consistent with a hemorrhagic stroke, likely due to a hypertensive bleed, given his history of poorly controlled hypertension. Hypertensive hemorrhages often occur in the basal ganglia, thalamus, pons, or cerebellum. The question asks for another condition that can cause a similar type of lesion. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is known to cause lobar hemorrhages, particularly in the elderly, due to deposition of amyloid in the cerebral vessels, leading to vessel fragility and rupture. This can result in a similar type of intracerebral hemorrhage as seen in hypertensive bleeds, although the locations may differ (CAA typically causes lobar hemorrhages, while hypertension often causes deep hemorrhages).",9
7843,"The patient has an INR of 13.5, which is significantly elevated, indicating a high risk of bleeding due to excessive anticoagulation from warfarin. Although the patient is asymptomatic and has no signs of bleeding, the INR level is critically high and requires intervention to prevent potential bleeding complications. 

The management of an elevated INR depends on the level of INR and the presence of bleeding. For an INR greater than 10 without bleeding, the recommended treatment is oral vitamin K (phytonadione) to help reduce the INR safely. Fresh frozen plasma and recombinant factor VIIa are typically reserved for cases where there is active bleeding or an urgent need to reverse anticoagulation. Protamine sulfate is used to reverse heparin, not warfarin.

Therefore, the appropriate treatment for this patient, who has a very high INR but no bleeding, is to administer phytonadione to lower the INR.",9
7844,"The patient is a 15-year-old girl with normal secondary sexual characteristics but absent menses and an absent uterus on ultrasound. This suggests a condition where there is normal ovarian function (as evidenced by normal breast development and pubic hair) but a lack of uterine development. The paramesonephric ducts (Müllerian ducts) are responsible for the development of the female internal reproductive structures, including the uterus, fallopian tubes, and the upper portion of the vagina. An absent uterus indicates a defect in the development of the paramesonephric ducts. This condition is consistent with Müllerian agenesis (Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome), where the paramesonephric ducts fail to develop properly, leading to an absent uterus and upper vagina, while the ovaries and external genitalia are normal.",9
7838,"The patient presents with gynecomastia, fatigue, weakness, poor appetite, and vascular lesions on the chest, which are likely spider angiomas. These findings, along with the lack of chest and axillary hair, suggest a hormonal imbalance. The presence of spider angiomas and gynecomastia are classic signs of liver dysfunction, specifically cirrhosis. Cirrhosis can lead to increased estrogen levels due to impaired metabolism, causing gynecomastia and other feminizing effects. The low blood pressure and lack of hepatosplenomegaly do not rule out cirrhosis, as these can vary depending on the stage and type of liver disease. The other options are less consistent with the full clinical picture: chronic kidney disease typically presents with different symptoms, hyperthyroidism would likely cause other systemic symptoms, and physiologic gynecomastia is less likely at this age and with these associated findings.",9
7851,"The patient is a 70-year-old man presenting with generalized fatigue and iron deficiency anemia, which is often due to chronic blood loss. His stool is positive for occult blood, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. The absence of symptoms like fever, abdominal pain, or weight loss, along with a normal appetite, suggests a chronic, low-grade bleeding source rather than an acute or inflammatory condition like diverticulitis. 

Diverticulitis (A) typically presents with abdominal pain, fever, and changes in bowel habits, which are not present here. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (B) is a genetic disorder that causes abnormal blood vessel formation, but it usually presents with epistaxis and visible telangiectasias, not isolated GI bleeding in an elderly patient. Intestinal obstruction (D) would present with abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation, which are not mentioned.

Angiodysplasia (C) is a common cause of occult GI bleeding in the elderly. It involves vascular malformations in the colon that can lead to chronic blood loss and iron deficiency anemia. The age of the patient and the presentation of occult blood in the stool without other significant symptoms make angiodysplasia the most likely diagnosis.",9
7848,"The patient presents with symptoms and findings suggestive of prosthetic valve endocarditis, likely due to the recent dental procedure. The presence of fever, splenomegaly, and a vegetation on the mechanical valve seen on echocardiography supports this diagnosis. The patient is hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 100/65 mm Hg and no signs of acute heart failure or shock, which makes immediate surgical intervention less urgent. The best initial management for suspected prosthetic valve endocarditis is to start empirical antibiotic therapy to cover common organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Therefore, the next best step is to administer broad-spectrum antibiotics, specifically vancomycin, gentamicin, and rifampin, to cover these organisms effectively.",9
7856,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of acute pericarditis, including chest pain that worsens with inspiration and a friction rub heard on auscultation. The recent history of an upper respiratory infection and the current symptoms are consistent with viral pericarditis. Among the options, picornaviruses, specifically coxsackieviruses (a type of enterovirus), are well-known causes of viral pericarditis. The other viruses listed are not typically associated with pericarditis. Therefore, the most likely pathogen type causing this patient's condition is a picornavirus.",9
7861,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are suggestive of Wilson disease. The key features include psychiatric symptoms (depression, irritability, personality changes), jaundice, hepatomegaly, and neurological signs (gait disturbances). The presence of dark rings around the iris, known as Kayser-Fleischer rings, is characteristic of Wilson disease. Laboratory findings show normocytic normochromic anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and decreased serum ceruloplasmin levels, which are indicative of Wilson disease. Hemochromatosis typically presents with skin pigmentation changes and diabetes, which are not noted here. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis do not typically present with Kayser-Fleischer rings or decreased ceruloplasmin.",9
7859,"The patient presents with acute onset of severe right leg pain, irregular pulse, and decreased pulses in the right lower extremity, suggesting acute arterial embolism. The irregular pulse indicates atrial fibrillation, which is a common source of emboli. Echocardiography can identify cardiac sources of emboli, such as thrombi in the left atrium due to atrial fibrillation. Doppler ultrasonography of the legs would assess for deep vein thrombosis, which is less likely given the presentation. Biopsy of a superficial vein is not relevant here. Digital subtraction angiography would show the site of arterial occlusion but not the source of the embolus. Therefore, echocardiography is most likely to confirm the underlying source of the embolism.",9
7863,"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest an injury to the supraspinatus muscle, which is part of the rotator cuff. The test described is the ""empty can"" test, which is used to assess the integrity of the supraspinatus muscle. The supraspinatus is responsible for the initial 15 degrees of shoulder abduction and is innervated by the suprascapular nerve. The pain and weakness during the test indicate a problem with this muscle, likely due to overuse or strain from pitching.",9
7855,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs consistent with heart failure, including chest pain, shortness of breath, bilateral pitting edema, crackles in the lungs, jugular venous distention, an S3 gallop, cardiomegaly, and pulmonary edema. In heart failure, certain medications have been shown to reduce mortality. Digoxin (A) is used for symptom control but does not reduce mortality. Furosemide (B) is a diuretic that helps with fluid overload but does not reduce mortality. Lisinopril (C) is an ACE inhibitor that has been shown to reduce mortality in heart failure patients by decreasing afterload and improving cardiac output. Propranolol (D) is a non-selective beta-blocker not typically used in heart failure; instead, specific beta-blockers like carvedilol or metoprolol succinate are used. Therefore, the medication that would be effective in lowering her risk of mortality is Lisinopril.",9
7870,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest Wernicke's encephalopathy, which is characterized by confusion, ophthalmoplegia (such as nystagmus), and ataxia. This condition is commonly associated with chronic alcohol abuse and is due to a deficiency in thiamine (Vitamin B1). Administering glucose before thiamine can precipitate or worsen the symptoms of Wernicke's encephalopathy. Therefore, thiamine should be administered before glucose to prevent exacerbation of the condition.",9
7868,"The clinical presentation of the neonate with jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, and positive Coombs tests suggests hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN). The direct Coombs test indicates that antibodies are bound to the infant's red blood cells, while the indirect Coombs test indicates that there are antibodies in the mother's serum that can bind to red blood cells. In HDN, the mother generates IgG antibodies against fetal red blood cells, which can cross the placenta and cause hemolysis in the fetus. IgM antibodies do not cross the placenta, so options A and C are incorrect. Vitamin K deficiency does not cause hemolytic anemia, making option D incorrect. Therefore, the most consistent explanation is that the mother generated IgG antibodies against fetal red blood cells.",9
7877,"The patient was found unconscious with an empty bottle of vodka, suggesting alcohol use. Upon receiving IV glucose, he becomes confused and agitated with horizontal nystagmus. This presentation is consistent with Wernicke's encephalopathy, which is caused by a deficiency in thiamine (Vitamin B1). Administering glucose without thiamine can precipitate or worsen Wernicke's encephalopathy in individuals with thiamine deficiency, often seen in chronic alcohol users.",9
7874,"The patient is in active labor with full cervical dilation and effacement, indicating she is ready for delivery. The vertex is at 0 station, meaning the fetal head is engaged but not yet descended into the birth canal. The presence of oligohydramnios suggests a potential for fetal distress, which might be reflected in the cardiotocography. If the cardiotocography shows signs of fetal distress, such as late decelerations or prolonged bradycardia, immediate interventions are necessary. Maternal repositioning and oxygen administration can improve uteroplacental perfusion and fetal oxygenation, which is a common initial step in managing non-reassuring fetal heart rate patterns. An emergent cesarean section is reserved for cases where there is no improvement with initial interventions or if there is a persistent, severe fetal distress. Reassurance is appropriate if the fetal heart tracing is normal. Elevation of the fetal head is not a standard intervention in this scenario.",9
7885,"Cat bites are known to have a high risk of infection due to the presence of bacteria such as Pasteurella multocida. The puncture nature of the wound also increases the risk of infection. In this case, the patient has been bitten by a cat, and the wound has been cleaned and irrigated. The most appropriate next step is to provide antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infection. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is the recommended antibiotic for cat bites as it covers Pasteurella multocida and other potential pathogens. Obtaining a wound culture is not necessary unless there are signs of infection. Closing the wound surgically or with tissue adhesive is not recommended due to the risk of trapping bacteria inside and increasing the risk of infection.",9
7882,"The clinical presentation suggests that the infant has an immunodeficiency, likely due to HIV infection, given the history of poor weight gain, chronic diarrhea, recurrent infections, and oral thrush (thick white plaques on the tongue). The mother received no prenatal care, which could mean she was not screened or treated for HIV during pregnancy. Zidovudine is an antiretroviral medication used to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Administering Zidovudine to the mother during pregnancy and to the infant after birth could have prevented the transmission of HIV, thereby preventing the infant's condition.",9
7889,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are suggestive of bacterial vaginosis (BV). BV is characterized by a malodorous, thin, gray vaginal discharge with a fishy odor that is often more noticeable after intercourse. The pH of the discharge is typically above 4.5, which aligns with the pH of 6.0 in this case. The presence of a thin, homogeneous discharge with bubbles further supports this diagnosis. 

The key diagnostic feature of BV on microscopic examination is the presence of ""clue cells,"" which are epithelial cells coated with bacteria. This is the expected finding on wet mount microscopy for BV.

A. Gram-positive diplococci on Gram stain would suggest gonorrhea, not BV.
B. A negative whiff test would not be consistent with BV, as BV typically has a positive whiff test.
C. Bacteria-coated epithelial cells on wet mount microscopy are clue cells, indicative of BV.
D. Numerous gram-positive rod-shaped bacteria would suggest normal vaginal flora, such as Lactobacillus, not BV.",9
7891,"The patient is in active labor with the cervix fully dilated and effaced, but the fetal vertex remains at -4 station despite strong uterine contractions and maternal pushing. The fetal heart tracing shows late decelerations, indicating fetal distress. The vertex being at -4 station suggests that the fetal head is not descending into the pelvis, which is unusual given the strong contractions and maternal effort. This scenario is indicative of cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD), where the fetal head is too large to pass through the maternal pelvis. Epidural anesthesia can slow labor but is unlikely to cause the head to remain at such a high station. Inefficient maternal pushing is less likely given the strong contractions and prolonged effort. Deep transverse arrest occurs when the fetal head is engaged but fails to rotate; however, the head is not engaged here. Therefore, CPD is the most likely cause of the prolonged labor.",9
7895,"The patient presents with recurrent nosebleeds, active bleeding from both nostrils, and dilated pupils. His vital signs show tachycardia and hypertension. The normal coagulation profile and platelet count suggest that a bleeding disorder is unlikely. The use of aspirin could contribute to bleeding, but it is not the most likely cause given the other symptoms. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia would typically present with telangiectasias on the skin or mucous membranes, which are not mentioned here. Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma is more common in adolescent males and would not typically cause bilateral nosebleeds without a mass effect. The dilated pupils, hypertension, and tachycardia are suggestive of sympathetic stimulation, which is consistent with cocaine use. Cocaine use can cause recurrent nosebleeds due to its vasoconstrictive effects and potential for mucosal damage.",9
7898,"The patient presents with irregular menses, fatigue, obesity, hypertension, facial hair, acne, muscle weakness, and ecchymosis. Laboratory findings show leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and hyperglycemia. These symptoms and lab findings are consistent with Cushing syndrome, which is characterized by excess cortisol. Cortisol can cause hypertension, hyperglycemia, muscle weakness, and skin changes such as ecchymosis. The hypokalemia and hypernatremia suggest mineralocorticoid effects, which can also be seen in Cushing syndrome due to cortisol's mineralocorticoid activity. The presence of facial hair and acne can be due to increased androgens, which can also occur in Cushing syndrome. While polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) can cause irregular menses and hirsutism, it does not typically cause the electrolyte abnormalities or muscle weakness seen here. Primary hyperaldosteronism would cause hypertension and hypokalemia but not the other symptoms. Hypothyroidism would not cause these findings either. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Cushing syndrome.",9
7899,"The patient is an 18-year-old male with tall stature, mild gynecomastia, sparse facial hair, and small firm testes. His laboratory results show elevated FSH and LH levels, indicating hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. These findings are suggestive of Klinefelter syndrome, which is caused by the presence of an extra X chromosome (47,XXY) due to meiotic nondisjunction. Anabolic steroid use would typically suppress FSH and LH levels. A CGG trinucleotide repeat disorder is associated with Fragile X syndrome, which does not match this presentation. Failure of neuronal migration is related to conditions like lissencephaly, which is not relevant here. Therefore, the most likely etiology is meiotic nondisjunction.",9
7900,"To prevent nephrolithiasis, particularly calcium oxalate stones, certain changes in urine composition are beneficial. Decreasing calcium and oxalate concentrations in the urine reduces the likelihood of crystal formation. Citrate acts as an inhibitor of stone formation by binding calcium, thus preventing calcium oxalate precipitation. Increased free water clearance, which implies higher urine volume and dilution, also helps prevent stone formation by reducing the concentration of stone-forming solutes. Therefore, the optimal urine composition for preventing calcium oxalate stones would involve decreased calcium, increased citrate, decreased oxalate, and increased free water clearance.",9
7903,"The patient presents with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI) and has a history of Romano-Ward syndrome, which is associated with long QT syndrome. She cannot take carbapenems or cephalosporins due to adverse reactions. The urinalysis shows epithelial casts and a high FeNa, suggesting acute tubular necrosis (ATN), likely due to nephrotoxic injury from the antibiotic. The urine culture shows E. coli, a common cause of UTIs. Among the options, Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside known for nephrotoxicity, which aligns with the findings of ATN. Aztreonam and Levofloxacin are less likely to cause nephrotoxicity, and Clindamycin is not typically used for UTIs. Therefore, Tobramycin is the most likely antibiotic given, causing the renal impairment seen in the lab results.",9
7919,"The patient is a chronic alcoholic, as indicated by her history of acute alcohol intoxication and the high blood alcohol level. Chronic alcohol use is known to cause liver damage, often resulting in elevated liver enzymes. In alcoholic liver disease, the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level is typically higher than the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, often in a ratio greater than 2:1. Additionally, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) is often elevated in chronic alcohol use due to its induction by alcohol. Therefore, the most likely laboratory findings in this patient would be elevated AST greater than ALT and increased GGT.",9
7915,"The transverse tubules (T-tubules) in skeletal muscle cells are invaginations of the sarcolemma that play a crucial role in conducting action potentials from the surface of the muscle fiber to the interior. This ensures rapid and uniform transmission of the action potential to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, leading to synchronized release of calcium ions and subsequent muscle contraction. If there is a lack of consistent density of T-tubules, the action potential may not be efficiently transmitted throughout the muscle fiber, leading to asynchronous calcium release and impaired synchronization of cross-bridge formation during muscle contraction. This would result in less effective muscle contraction. The other options are not directly related to the function of T-tubules in skeletal muscle cells.",9
7913,"The patient presents with nephrotic syndrome, as indicated by significant proteinuria (4.8 g/24 hours), facial puffiness, and edema. The urinalysis shows oval fat bodies, which are characteristic of nephrotic syndrome. The renal biopsy reveals diffuse capillary and basement membrane thickening. This finding is suggestive of membranous nephropathy, which is often associated with solid tumors such as colon cancer. In membranous nephropathy, electron microscopy typically shows a 'spike and dome' appearance due to subepithelial immune complex deposits. Therefore, the expected finding on electron microscopy is the 'spike and dome' appearance.",9
7916,"The child has a history of recurrent urinary tract infections and presents with symptoms suggestive of pyelonephritis, such as fever and costovertebral angle tenderness. Given the chronic nature of his condition and recurrent infections, there is a possibility of chronic pyelonephritis. In chronic pyelonephritis, especially in the context of recurrent infections, the kidney can develop scarring and histological changes. One of the characteristic findings in chronic pyelonephritis is the presence of thyroidization of the tubules, where the tubules contain eosinophilic casts resembling thyroid tissue. This corresponds to tubular colloid casts with diffuse lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate.",9
7927,"In the crossbridge cycle of muscle contraction, the myosin head binds to actin to form a crossbridge. For the myosin head to detach from the actin filament, ATP must bind to the myosin head. This binding of ATP causes a conformational change in the myosin head, leading to the detachment of myosin from actin. After detachment, ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP and inorganic phosphate, which re-cocks the myosin head, preparing it for the next cycle of attachment and power stroke. Therefore, the binding of ATP to the myosin head is the key step that causes detachment from actin.",9
7929,"The scenario describes a spirometry test where the patient is asked to take a deep breath in and then forcefully exhale all the air out. This maneuver measures the volume of air that can be maximally inhaled and then exhaled, which is known as the vital capacity. Expiratory reserve volume is the additional air that can be exhaled after a normal exhalation, tidal volume is the amount of air inhaled or exhaled during normal breathing, and total lung capacity is the total volume of air in the lungs after a maximal inhalation. Therefore, the volume of expired air in this test is the vital capacity.",9
7935,"The newborn is stable with normal vital signs and no immediate distress. Standard care for a newborn includes prophylactic measures to prevent vitamin K deficiency bleeding and gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum. The administration of intramuscular vitamin K is crucial to prevent bleeding disorders, and topical erythromycin is used to prevent eye infections. Silver nitrate is an older method for eye prophylaxis and is not commonly used today. Fluid resuscitation is unnecessary as the infant shows no signs of dehydration or shock. Therefore, the best next step in management is to provide the standard prophylactic care with IM vitamin K and topical erythromycin.",9
7934,"The patient has alcoholic cirrhosis with signs of liver dysfunction, such as gynecomastia, palmar erythema, and thrombocytopenia. The laboratory findings show mild anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia, which are consistent with hypersplenism due to portal hypertension. The liver function tests are relatively stable, and the α-fetoprotein level is within normal limits, suggesting no immediate concern for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The ultrasound shows a nodular liver surface, which is typical for cirrhosis, but no masses were noted. In a patient with cirrhosis, regular surveillance for HCC is recommended. The most appropriate management step is to continue surveillance with imaging. Given the current findings, repeating the abdominal ultrasound in 6 months is a reasonable approach to monitor for any changes suggestive of HCC.",9
7933,"The patient exhibits a sudden and dramatic change in behavior, including grandiosity and a lack of awareness of her actions, which are not typical for her. This episode occurred shortly after a significant stressor (the death of her husband), and she does not recall the odd behavior. The symptoms are acute and transient, lasting less than a month, which aligns with a brief psychotic disorder. There is no evidence of a personality disorder, as those are characterized by enduring patterns of behavior and inner experience. The absence of hallucinations and the return to a more normal state also support a brief psychotic disorder rather than a personality disorder.",9
7937,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of hyperthyroidism, such as restlessness, racing thoughts, fever, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and an irregularly irregular heart rhythm, which could indicate atrial fibrillation. These symptoms can occur in the context of thyroid dysfunction, particularly hyperthyroidism. In patients with bipolar disorder on lithium, thyroid function should be monitored because lithium can affect thyroid function, potentially leading to hypothyroidism or, less commonly, hyperthyroidism. To evaluate for hyperthyroidism, the most appropriate initial laboratory tests are the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (T4) levels. TSH is typically suppressed in hyperthyroidism, and free T4 is elevated. Therefore, the most useful test in this scenario is to measure TSH and free T4 levels.",9
7943,"The clinical presentation of the 11-month-old boy includes recurrent otitis media, growth retardation (5th percentile for height and weight), petechiae, eczema, and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count of 29,000/mm3). Additionally, there is an increased serum IgE concentration. These findings are characteristic of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, which is an X-linked recessive condition characterized by the triad of eczema, recurrent infections, and thrombocytopenia. The increased IgE and recurrent infections are consistent with the immunodeficiency aspect of the syndrome. The other options do not fit the combination of symptoms as well as Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome does.",9
7954,"The patient presents with primary amenorrhea, short stature, and physical features such as a short neck and wide torso, which are suggestive of Turner syndrome. Turner syndrome is characterized by the presence of a single X chromosome (45,X karyotype) and is associated with delayed puberty and primary amenorrhea due to gonadal dysgenesis. The most accurate test to confirm Turner syndrome is a karyotype analysis, which will reveal the chromosomal abnormality. Other tests like serum FSH and LH levels can indicate ovarian failure, but they are not definitive for diagnosing Turner syndrome. Therefore, the most accurate test for this condition is karyotype analysis.",9
7947,"The presentation of the 6-year-old boy is suggestive of Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), a small-vessel vasculitis commonly seen in children. The key features include a palpable purpuric rash on the lower extremities, abdominal pain, and arthralgia (knee pain in this case). The recent upper respiratory infection is a common preceding event for HSP. The rash described as maroon macules and papules is consistent with palpable purpura. The abdominal pain and joint pain are also classic symptoms. In HSP, the underlying pathology is leukocytoclastic vasculitis, which is a small-vessel vasculitis characterized by the presence of neutrophils and nuclear debris in the vessel walls. This is the most likely finding in this patient.",9
7963,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with Sheehan's syndrome, which occurs due to postpartum pituitary gland failure. This condition is often caused by significant blood loss during or after childbirth, leading to pituitary gland ischemia and necrosis. The symptoms include lack of lactation (due to low prolactin), fatigue, hypotension, weight loss, and amenorrhea (due to low levels of other pituitary hormones). The key contributing factor in this scenario is obstetric hemorrhage, which leads to reduced blood supply to the pituitary gland.",10
7968,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of sciatica, likely due to a lumbar disc herniation, given the pain radiating down the leg. The absence of red flag symptoms such as bowel or bladder dysfunction, significant neurological deficits, or signs of cauda equina syndrome suggests that this is a typical case of acute low back pain with radiculopathy. In such cases, conservative management is usually the first step. NSAIDs can help with pain and inflammation, and maintaining activity as tolerated is recommended to prevent deconditioning. Bed rest is generally not advised as it can lead to worse outcomes. An MRI is not immediately necessary unless there are red flags or the symptoms persist despite conservative management.",9
7960,"The clinical presentation is consistent with measles (rubeola), characterized by cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, Koplik spots, and a descending maculopapular rash. A known late complication of measles is subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a rare but fatal progressive neurological disorder that occurs years after the initial infection. SSPE leads to CNS degeneration. The other options do not relate to measles: valvular heart disease is not associated with measles, nonreactive pupils are not a known complication, and monoarticular arthritis is not a typical sequela of measles.",9
7961,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of a molar pregnancy, as indicated by the high β-hCG levels, hydropic chorionic villi, and absence of embryonic parts. In molar pregnancies, the elevated β-hCG levels can lead to the development of theca lutein cysts in the ovaries. These cysts are typically bilateral and multilocular, which matches the ultrasound findings of enlarged ovaries with multiple thin-walled, septated cysts. Theca lutein cysts are associated with conditions that cause elevated levels of hCG, such as molar pregnancies, multiple gestations, and choriocarcinoma.",9
7976,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with volume overload and uremia due to missed dialysis, as evidenced by dyspnea, orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, and asterixis (flapping tremor). The bloody emesis and nasogastric lavage suggest a gastrointestinal bleed, likely related to his peptic ulcer disease. However, the lavage clears, indicating the bleeding may have stopped. The most pressing issue is the missed dialysis, leading to fluid overload and uremic symptoms. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to address the underlying cause of his symptoms by performing hemodialysis.",9
7977,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest acute salicylate (aspirin) toxicity. The symptoms include tinnitus (noise in the ears), tachycardia, tachypnea, and diaphoresis. The blood gas analysis shows a mixed acid-base disorder: a primary respiratory alkalosis (low PaCO2) and a primary metabolic acidosis (low HCO3-), which is typical in salicylate poisoning.

In cases of salicylate toxicity, the first step in management is to prevent further absorption and enhance elimination. Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal is effective if administered within a few hours of ingestion. However, given that 12 hours have passed, the focus should be on enhancing elimination and correcting acid-base disturbances.

The most appropriate first step is to initiate supportive care, which includes ensuring adequate ventilation and oxygenation, correcting fluid and electrolyte imbalances, and alkalinizing the urine to enhance salicylate excretion. This is typically done with intravenous sodium bicarbonate.

Hemodialysis is considered in severe cases, especially if there is renal failure, altered mental status, or very high salicylate levels, but it is not the first step in this scenario.

Therefore, the most appropriate first step in management is supportive care, which includes alkalinization of the urine with sodium bicarbonate.",9
7972,"The patient's symptoms include chronic body aches, morning stiffness, and tingling in the upper extremities. The examination reveals tenderness in specific areas such as the posterior neck, trapezius, and knee. The normal complete blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate suggest the absence of significant inflammation or infection. 

Polymyositis (A) typically presents with muscle weakness rather than pain and would likely show elevated muscle enzymes or inflammatory markers. Major depressive disorder (B) can cause somatic symptoms but does not typically present with specific tender points. Rheumatoid arthritis (D) usually involves joint swelling and elevated inflammatory markers, which are not present here.

Fibromyalgia (C) is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and tenderness in specific areas, often without abnormal laboratory findings. The patient's symptoms and tender points are consistent with fibromyalgia.",9
7971,"The patient presents with numbness in the bilateral shoulders and arms following a fall, with reduced perception of sharp stimuli and temperature in these areas, while vibratory sense is preserved. This pattern suggests a sensory dissociation typical of a central cord syndrome, where the central part of the spinal cord is affected, often due to trauma. This syndrome typically affects the upper extremities more than the lower extremities, which aligns with the patient's symptoms. Anterior cord syndrome would present with motor deficits and loss of pain and temperature below the lesion, which is not the case here. Guillain-Barre syndrome would present with ascending weakness and areflexia, not sensory dissociation. A pontine infarction would likely cause cranial nerve deficits and other brainstem-related symptoms, which are not present here.",9
7975,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a sudden onset of visual impairment in the right eye. The key points are the sudden blurring and darkening of vision, multiple dark streaks, and a diminished red reflex with an obscured fundus. These findings are consistent with a vitreous hemorrhage, where blood in the vitreous humor obscures the view of the retina and diminishes the red reflex. Central retinal vein occlusion typically presents with a 'blood and thunder' appearance on fundoscopic exam, which is not possible here due to the obscured fundus. Central retinal artery occlusion would present with sudden, painless vision loss and a cherry-red spot on the macula, but again, the fundus is not visible. Cataracts cause gradual vision loss and would not cause sudden changes or an obscured fundus. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is vitreous hemorrhage.",9
7979,"The patient has a T-score of -2.6, indicating osteoporosis. She was likely prescribed a medication to treat this condition. The complaint of hot flashes suggests a side effect profile consistent with selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). Raloxifene is a SERM used to treat osteoporosis and is known to cause hot flashes as a side effect. Alendronate, denosumab, and zoledronic acid are other osteoporosis treatments but do not typically cause hot flashes.",9
7978,"The scenario describes a patient experiencing an urticarial reaction and subsequent facial and neck edema after administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent. This suggests a histamine release, which is a known side effect of certain neuromuscular blockers. Among the options, D-tubocurarine is a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker known for causing histamine release, leading to reactions such as urticaria and edema. Succinylcholine is a depolarizing agent and is not typically associated with histamine release. Neostigmine is not a neuromuscular blocker; it is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used to reverse neuromuscular blockade. Ketamine is an anesthetic agent, not a neuromuscular blocker. Therefore, the most likely agent causing this reaction is D-tubocurarine.",9
7983,"The child's symptoms and history suggest a condition known as caudal regression syndrome, which is characterized by lower extremity paralysis, urinary incontinence, and abnormalities in the spine, pelvis, and lower limbs. This condition is often associated with maternal diabetes mellitus, particularly when it is poorly controlled during pregnancy. The other options, such as maternal use of tetracyclines, lithium, or nicotine, are not typically associated with the specific pattern of abnormalities seen in caudal regression syndrome.",9
7991,"The patient's symptoms of nausea, headache, confusion, and unsteady gait, combined with a normal oxygen saturation, suggest carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. CO binds to hemoglobin with high affinity, forming carboxyhemoglobin, which reduces the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity and affects cellular respiration. Despite normal pulse oximetry readings, which cannot differentiate between oxyhemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin, the clinical presentation is consistent with CO poisoning, especially given the setting of a lakeside cabin where CO exposure from a faulty heater or generator is possible. The most effective treatment for CO poisoning is hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which helps displace CO from hemoglobin and restore normal oxygen delivery to tissues.",9
7997,"The patient's symptoms of chronic weight loss, abdominal bloating, loose stools, and chronic cough, along with the laboratory findings of eosinophilia and the presence of roundworm larvae in the stool, are indicative of a parasitic infection. The key detail here is the presence of larvae, not eggs, in the stool. This is characteristic of Strongyloides stercoralis, which is known for causing autoinfection and can lead to chronic infection with larvae present in the stool. Ascaris lumbricoides typically presents with eggs in the stool, not larvae. Taenia saginata and Taenia solium are tapeworms and would not present with roundworm larvae in the stool. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is Strongyloides stercoralis.",9
7995,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of Goodpasture syndrome, which is characterized by the presence of anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies. These antibodies target the basement membrane in both the kidneys and lungs, leading to glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage. The pathogenesis involves the formation of autoantibodies against the body's own tissues, specifically the basement membrane.

To determine which condition has a similar pathogenesis, we need to identify another disease that involves autoantibody-mediated tissue damage. 

- **Henoch-Schönlein purpura** involves IgA deposition and is not primarily antibody-mediated against a specific tissue component.
- **Polyarteritis nodosa** is a necrotizing vasculitis not typically associated with direct autoantibody attack on a specific tissue.
- **Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis** involves immune complex deposition, not direct autoantibody attack.
- **Autoimmune hemolytic anemia** involves autoantibodies directed against red blood cell antigens, leading to their destruction.

The pathogenesis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, involving direct autoantibody-mediated destruction of cells, is most similar to that of Goodpasture syndrome, where autoantibodies target the basement membrane.",9
8010,"The patient is 32 weeks pregnant and has a positive finding for an organism on darkfield microscopy, which suggests syphilis. The standard treatment for syphilis during pregnancy is penicillin. However, the patient has a history of anaphylaxis to penicillin, which complicates the situation. In such cases, the recommended approach is to desensitize the patient to penicillin and then administer it, as penicillin is the only effective treatment for syphilis in pregnancy to prevent congenital syphilis. Other options like azithromycin or ceftriaxone are not recommended for treating syphilis in pregnancy. Therefore, the most appropriate management involves addressing the penicillin allergy through desensitization and then administering penicillin.",9
8015,"The clinical presentation and biopsy findings suggest a neuroblastoma, a common adrenal tumor in children. Neuroblastoma is characterized by small round blue cells on histology. A key diagnostic feature of neuroblastoma is the elevation of catecholamine metabolites in the urine, specifically vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid (HVA). Therefore, finding elevated VMA in the urine would confirm the diagnosis of neuroblastoma.",9
8014,"The drug decreases serum glucose levels without causing glucosuria, indicating that glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule is not directly affected. The positive urine anion gap suggests increased excretion of ammonium (NH4+), which is typically associated with changes in acid-base balance. In the proximal tubule, glutamine is metabolized to produce ammonium and bicarbonate, a process that is important for acid-base balance. Inhibition of glutamine transport would lead to decreased ammonium production and a positive urine anion gap. Therefore, the drug likely inhibits the transport of glutamine.",9
8017,"The patient presents with signs of heat stroke, evidenced by hyperthermia (104°F), tachycardia, tachypnea, and altered mental status after a marathon. The laboratory results show hypernatremia (Na+ 165 mEq/L), indicating dehydration. The priority in managing heat stroke is rapid cooling and rehydration. While hypotonic saline (B) could address hypernatremia, it is not typically used in acute settings due to the risk of cerebral edema. Normal saline (D) is isotonic and is the standard initial fluid for rehydration in acute settings, especially when rapid volume expansion is needed. Lactated Ringer (C) is also isotonic and can be used for rehydration, but normal saline is more commonly used initially in emergency settings. 50% normal saline 50% dextrose (A) is not appropriate for initial rehydration. Therefore, the best next step is to administer normal saline to address dehydration and support circulation.",9
8020,"The patient has a family history of breast cancer and a firm, immobile breast mass, which raises suspicion for breast cancer. The genetic analysis reveals a mutation on chromosome 17, which is associated with the BRCA1 gene. Mutations in the BRCA1 gene increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancers. Specifically, BRCA1 mutations are associated with an increased risk of developing serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary. Therefore, the patient is at increased risk for serous cystadenocarcinoma.",9
8025,"The patient is experiencing abdominal bloating, discomfort, and nausea without vomiting four days post-surgery, with absent bowel sounds and a distended, tympanic abdomen. The abdominal x-ray shows uniform gas distribution without air-fluid levels, suggesting postoperative ileus, a common condition after abdominal surgery. The use of opioids, such as hydromorphone, can exacerbate or contribute to ileus by reducing gastrointestinal motility. Therefore, reducing opioid use is a logical step to help restore bowel function. Other options like esophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy are not indicated as there is no evidence of obstruction or need for diagnostic evaluation of the GI tract. Total parenteral nutrition is not necessary at this stage as the ileus is likely temporary and can be managed conservatively.",9
8035,"The patient has signs of liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. In cirrhosis, the liver's ability to metabolize estrogen is impaired, leading to hyperestrogenism. This excess estrogen causes several physical findings. Palmar erythema and gynecomastia are both due to hyperestrogenism. Palmar erythema is caused by increased blood flow to the skin due to vasodilation, while gynecomastia is due to the stimulation of breast tissue by estrogen. Other findings like jaundice and flapping tremor are related to liver dysfunction and hepatic encephalopathy, respectively, while caput medusae and spider angiomata are related to portal hypertension and vascular changes. Testicular atrophy is also due to hormonal imbalances, but abdominal distension is due to ascites from portal hypertension.",9
8033,"The girl's symptoms are suggestive of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), characterized by compulsions (the urge to touch every wall) and obsessions (persistent thoughts about needing to touch the walls). The first-line treatment for OCD in children and adolescents is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), specifically exposure and response prevention. Medications like SSRIs or clomipramine are considered if CBT alone is insufficient or unavailable. Lorazepam is not typically used for OCD, and risperidone is not a first-line treatment for OCD. Therefore, the most appropriate initial step in management is CBT.",9
8032,"The patient presents with fatigue, conjunctival pallor, and laboratory findings consistent with normocytic anemia (normal MCV of 84 μm3). The low reticulocyte count indicates inadequate bone marrow response. She has chronic kidney disease (CKD) as evidenced by elevated creatinine (3.1 mg/dL) and urea nitrogen (48 mg/dL). In CKD, the kidneys produce less erythropoietin, leading to anemia. Her normal ferritin level suggests that iron deficiency is not the primary issue, and the normal MCV rules out vitamin B12 deficiency. The fecal occult blood test is pending, but the normal ferritin and normocytic anemia make chronic blood loss less likely. Malignant plasma cell replication (multiple myeloma) would typically present with different lab findings, such as hypercalcemia and rouleaux formation on blood smear. Therefore, the most likely cause of her anemia is decreased erythropoietin production due to CKD.",9
8039,"The patient is an 18-year-old pregnant woman at 10 weeks gestation with a urine culture showing >100,000 CFU of E. coli, which is indicative of asymptomatic bacteriuria. Asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy should be treated to prevent complications such as pyelonephritis, which can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes. The appropriate treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy is a course of antibiotics. Nitrofurantoin is a commonly used antibiotic for this purpose, and a typical course is for seven days. Therefore, the best next step in management is to treat with nitrofurantoin for seven days.",9
8030,"The patient presents with a discrepancy between her gestational age based on her last menstrual period (11 weeks) and the size of her uterus, which is palpated at the umbilicus, typically corresponding to around 20 weeks of gestation. Her ß-hCG level is also elevated at 81,324 mIU/mL, which is higher than expected for 11 weeks but can be seen in both multiple gestation and molar pregnancy. However, the presence of pelvic pressure and urinary frequency for the last 6 months suggests a chronic condition rather than an acute one. Her family history of fibroids and the fact that her mother had a hysterectomy for fibroids also point towards leiomyomata (fibroids) as a likely cause of the uterine enlargement. The absence of adnexal masses and the closed cervix further support this diagnosis. Molar pregnancy would typically present with more severe symptoms and a much higher ß-hCG level, while multiple gestation would not explain the chronic symptoms. An anteverted uterus is a normal variant and would not cause these findings.",9
8044,"The clinical presentation and biopsy findings are suggestive of Ewing sarcoma, a common bone tumor in children and adolescents. The key features include pain and swelling in the affected area, fever, elevated WBC count, and elevated ESR. The radiograph typically shows a lytic bone lesion with a ""moth-eaten"" appearance or ""onion-skin"" periosteal reaction. The biopsy reveals sheets of small round blue cells, which is characteristic of Ewing sarcoma. The genetic mutation most commonly associated with Ewing sarcoma is the translocation t(11;22), which results in the EWS-FLI1 fusion gene.",10
8047,"To determine the proportion of asthma hospitalizations in patients with PTSD that could be attributed to PTSD, we need to calculate the attributable risk percent (AR%). This is calculated using the formula: \( AR\% = \frac{(RR - 1)}{RR} \times 100 \). 

Given that the relative risk (RR) is 2.0, we can substitute into the formula:

\( AR\% = \frac{(2.0 - 1)}{2.0} \times 100 = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\% \).

Thus, 50% of the asthma hospitalizations in patients with PTSD could be attributed to PTSD.",10
8048,"The patient's symptoms include palpitations, weight loss, nervousness, irritability, insomnia, increased reflexes, and a fine tremor. These symptoms are consistent with hyperthyroidism. The moist palms and increased deep tendon reflexes with a shortened relaxation phase further support this diagnosis. The recent use of an herbal weight-loss pill suggests the possibility of exogenous substances contributing to her symptoms. Exogenous hyperthyroidism can occur due to the ingestion of thyroid hormone or thyroid hormone-like substances, which could be present in some weight-loss supplements. Hashimoto thyroiditis typically causes hypothyroidism, not hyperthyroidism, although it can cause transient hyperthyroid symptoms during the initial phase. However, the context of weight-loss supplements makes exogenous hyperthyroidism more likely. Coffee consumption and generalized anxiety disorder could explain some symptoms but not the full clinical picture, especially the increased reflexes and tremor.",9
8049,"The patient's presentation of masses on the auricle following ear piercing is suggestive of keloid formation. Keloids are characterized by excessive growth of scar tissue at the site of a healed skin injury, which is due to an overproduction of collagen. The key feature of keloids is the increased production of hyalinized collagen, which leads to the raised, firm, and often itchy or painful scar tissue that extends beyond the original wound boundaries. This aligns with option B, which describes the pathophysiology of keloid formation.",9
8050,"The patient presents with a persistent cough following an upper respiratory infection, which is suggestive of pertussis (whooping cough). The cough has lasted for 2 weeks and is now more severe, which aligns with the paroxysmal stage of pertussis. The absence of significant findings on physical examination and chest X-ray further supports this diagnosis. In adults, pertussis can present with a prolonged cough without the classic 'whoop.' The recommended treatment for pertussis is a macrolide antibiotic, such as azithromycin. Levofloxacin and amoxicillin are not first-line treatments for pertussis. Azithromycin with amoxicillin-clavulanate is unnecessary as azithromycin alone is sufficient.",9
8051,"The patient presents with persistent bleeding after dental surgery, a history of easy bruising, and a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) with normal platelet count and bleeding time. The family history suggests an X-linked pattern, as the maternal uncle also had similar symptoms. The normal bleeding time and platelet count, along with the prolonged PTT, point towards a coagulation factor deficiency rather than a platelet function disorder. Hemophilia, which is X-linked, typically presents with prolonged PTT and normal bleeding time, fitting the clinical picture. Von Willebrand disease would usually show prolonged bleeding time and possibly prolonged PTT, but the bleeding time here is normal. Glanzmann thrombasthenia and Bernard-Soulier syndrome would show abnormalities in platelet function tests and bleeding time, which are not present here. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Hemophilia.",9
8059,"The patient's symptoms and positive serology for IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies suggest celiac disease. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten ingestion, leading to damage in the small intestine. The classic histological finding on duodenal biopsy in celiac disease is villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes. This matches option D. 

Option A describes findings typical of Crohn's disease, which is characterized by transmural inflammation and noncaseating granulomas. Option B describes ulcerative colitis, which is characterized by crypt abscesses and pseudopolyps. Option C would indicate a normal biopsy, which is not consistent with the positive serology and symptoms of celiac disease.",9
8057,"The patient presents with diarrhea, dehydration, and laboratory findings suggestive of an acid-base disturbance. The key lab values are:

- Serum bicarbonate: 19 mEq/L (low)
- Serum pH: 7.3 (acidic)
- PCO2: 38 mm Hg (normal to slightly elevated)

The low bicarbonate and acidic pH indicate a metabolic acidosis. To determine if it is an anion gap or non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, we calculate the anion gap:

Anion gap = Na - (Cl + HCO3) = 144 - (115 + 19) = 10 mEq/L

A normal anion gap is typically between 8-12 mEq/L. This patient's anion gap is within the normal range, indicating a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis.

The PCO2 is slightly elevated for a metabolic acidosis, suggesting that there is some degree of respiratory compensation, although it may not be fully compensatory given the severity of the acidosis.

Therefore, the patient has a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation, likely due to diarrhea causing a loss of bicarbonate.",9
8062,"The clinical presentation is highly suggestive of intussusception, which is common in infants and young children. The key features include intermittent abdominal pain, vomiting (which can become bilious), and the passage of ""currant jelly"" stools (blood and mucus). The palpable sausage-shaped mass in the right upper quadrant further supports this diagnosis. The most appropriate and effective initial treatment for intussusception in a stable patient is a non-surgical reduction using an air enema, which is both diagnostic and therapeutic. Exploratory laparotomy is reserved for cases where non-surgical reduction is unsuccessful or if the patient is unstable. Imaging like X-ray or MRI is not the immediate next step in management when the diagnosis is clinically apparent and the patient is stable.",9
8068,"The hormone measured in the urine pregnancy test is human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). hCG is produced by the syncytiotrophoblast of the developing placenta shortly after implantation. One of the primary roles of hCG is to maintain the corpus luteum during the early stages of pregnancy. The corpus luteum is responsible for producing progesterone, which is crucial for maintaining the uterine lining and supporting early pregnancy until the placenta can take over progesterone production. Therefore, the process directly associated with hCG is the maintenance of the corpus luteum.",10
8063,"The patient presents with wrist pain and numbness after a fall, with specific sensory and motor deficits. The numbness is along the medial aspect of the hand, affecting the palmar medial 2 digits (4th and 5th fingers), which is innervated by the ulnar nerve. The motor deficit described is the claw hand deformity, where the 4th and 5th fingers are hyperextended at the MCP joints and flexed at the IP joints, indicating an ulnar nerve injury. The normal sensation in the lateral 3 digits and palm suggests the median nerve is intact. The claw hand deformity is more pronounced with a distal ulnar nerve injury, as the intrinsic muscles of the hand (innervated by the ulnar nerve) are affected, leading to the imbalance of flexor and extensor forces on the fingers. Therefore, the nerve most likely affected is the distal ulnar nerve.",9
8070,"The patient's symptoms of anxiety, palpitations, weight loss, and mild exophthalmos suggest hyperthyroidism. Exophthalmos is particularly associated with Graves' disease, which is an autoimmune disorder where thyroid stimulating antibodies (TSI) stimulate the thyroid gland to produce excess thyroid hormones. This leads to the symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Inadequate iodine in the diet typically causes hypothyroidism or goiter, not hyperthyroidism. Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid is a type of thyroid cancer that does not typically present with these symptoms. Propylthiouracil is a treatment for hyperthyroidism, not a cause. Therefore, the most likely cause of her symptoms is thyroid stimulating antibodies, consistent with Graves' disease.",9
8065,"The patient presents with pancytopenia (low hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count) and a very low reticulocyte count, indicating reduced bone marrow activity. The absence of organomegaly and the laboratory findings suggest bone marrow failure. Aplastic anemia is characterized by bone marrow failure with replacement of hematopoietic cells by fat, leading to pancytopenia. Therefore, the bone marrow biopsy would show increased fat cells, or hyperplasia of adipocytes, due to the lack of normal hematopoietic cells.",9
8078,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest hypocalcemia, as indicated by the low calcium level (7.0 mg/dL). Hypocalcemia can lead to neuromuscular excitability, which is evidenced by the presence of Trousseau and Chvostek signs, muscle cramps, and tingling sensations. 

In hypocalcemia, the threshold for action potentials in neurons and muscle cells is lowered, leading to increased excitability. This is primarily due to a reduction in the afterhyperpolarization phase of the action potential. Normally, calcium ions contribute to stabilizing the membrane potential and help in the repolarization phase. When calcium levels are low, the membrane potential is less stable, and neurons are more easily depolarized, leading to increased neuromuscular excitability.

Thus, the electrophysiologic mechanism that best explains the clinical features of hypocalcemia is the reduction of afterhyperpolarization, which increases neuronal excitability.",9
8079,"The patient's symptoms of crampy abdominal pain, abdominal distension, and inability to pass stool or flatus suggest a bowel obstruction. The history of lower stool caliber over the past month indicates a possible narrowing of the bowel lumen, which is often associated with a mass or tumor. The patient's age and the gradual change in stool caliber are suggestive of a colorectal malignancy, such as a sigmoid tumor. While adhesions are a common cause of bowel obstruction, especially in patients with a history of abdominal surgery, the change in stool caliber is more indicative of a tumor. The absence of guarding or rebound tenderness and the normal leukocyte count make diverticulitis less likely. Acute mesenteric ischemia would typically present with more severe pain and possibly signs of peritonitis. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is a sigmoid tumor.",9
8072,"The newborn presents with several characteristic features that suggest a specific chromosomal abnormality. The micrognathia, prominent occiput, low-set ears, clenched fists with overlapping fingers, and cardiac murmur are classic signs of trisomy 18, also known as Edwards syndrome. The description of the feet with prominent heels and convex, rounded soles further supports this diagnosis. Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) typically presents with different features such as a flat facial profile, epicanthic folds, and a single transverse palmar crease. Maternal alcohol intake can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome, which has distinct features like smooth philtrum and thin upper lip, not described here. FMR1 gene silencing is associated with Fragile X syndrome, which presents with intellectual disability and distinct facial features not matching this case. Therefore, the most likely cause of these findings is trisomy of chromosome 18.",9
8081,"The patient has gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with evidence of esophagitis, as shown by erythema and erosions in the distal esophagus. The most effective treatment for GERD, especially with esophagitis, is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). PPIs work by inhibiting the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme in the gastric parietal cells, which is responsible for the final step in the secretion of gastric acid. This leads to a significant reduction in gastric acid production, allowing healing of the esophageal mucosa. Therefore, the mechanism of action of the most appropriate drug for this patient is the inhibition of ATPase.",9
8082,"The patient is experiencing watery diarrhea after antibiotic therapy, and sigmoidoscopy shows diffuse yellow plaques on the mucosa, which is indicative of pseudomembranous colitis caused by Clostridioides difficile infection. The standard treatment for mild to moderate C. difficile infection is oral metronidazole. Oral vancomycin is also used, especially in severe cases, but it is not listed as an option here. Therefore, the best choice of treatment from the given options is oral metronidazole.",9
8086,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), which is characterized by the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. The history of a preceding diarrheal illness, likely due to an E. coli infection, supports this diagnosis. The laboratory findings of anemia with schistocytes, thrombocytopenia, and elevated creatinine confirm the diagnosis. In HUS, supportive care is the mainstay of treatment, and hemodialysis is indicated for severe renal impairment or electrolyte imbalances. Given the elevated creatinine and symptoms of renal failure, hemodialysis is the most appropriate next step.",9
8092,"The patient has a history of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), which is associated with bilateral vestibular schwannomas. The symptoms of hearing loss, tinnitus, headaches, and vertigo are consistent with a vestibular schwannoma. The tuning fork tests show sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear (Weber test lateralizes to the left ear, and Rinne’s test shows air conduction greater than bone conduction in both ears). The biopsy results show cells staining positive for S100, which is characteristic of schwannomas, as these tumors are derived from Schwann cells. The negative staining for GFAP helps rule out glial tumors. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a schwannoma.",9
8089,"The patient presents with signs of intra-amniotic infection (chorioamnionitis), indicated by fever, tachycardia, and malodorous amniotic fluid. She is at 36 weeks' gestation, and the fetus is viable with a reactive heart rate. The management of chorioamnionitis involves prompt delivery to prevent maternal and fetal complications. Antibiotics are necessary to treat the infection. Inducing labor is preferred over immediate C-section unless there are obstetric indications for a C-section. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to administer antibiotics and induce labor.",9
8094,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest that the child has phenylketonuria (PKU), a condition characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme is responsible for converting phenylalanine to tyrosine. In PKU, phenylalanine accumulates, leading to elevated levels of phenylacetate in the urine, and tyrosine becomes deficient. Normally, tyrosine is a non-essential amino acid because it is synthesized from phenylalanine. However, in PKU, since the conversion is impaired, tyrosine becomes an essential amino acid that must be obtained from the diet. The family history of intellectual disability and the child's developmental delays further support the diagnosis of PKU. Therefore, the amino acid that becomes nutritionally essential in this condition is tyrosine.",9
8088,"The patient's presentation is consistent with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Key features include a pattern of unstable relationships, emotional instability, impulsive behavior, and fear of abandonment. The history of repeated breakups, mood swings lasting a few hours, and self-harm attempts align with BPD. Narcissistic personality disorder is characterized by grandiosity and lack of empathy, which doesn't fit this case. Cyclothymic disorder involves chronic mood fluctuations over years, not hours. Bipolar II disorder involves hypomanic and depressive episodes, but the mood swings in this case are too brief for this diagnosis.",9
8095,"The patient is experiencing a fetal demise at 24 weeks gestation. In such cases, the management typically involves delivering the fetus. The patient has expressed a desire for the fetus to pass ""as naturally as possible,"" which suggests a preference for a vaginal delivery rather than surgical intervention. 

A Caesarean delivery (Option A) is not indicated in this situation as it is more invasive and not necessary for a fetal demise unless there are specific maternal indications.

Dilation and curettage (Option B) is generally used for first-trimester losses and is not appropriate for a 24-week gestation.

Dilation and evacuation (Option C) is a surgical procedure used for second-trimester losses but may not align with the patient's desire for a natural process.

Induction of labor (Option D) is the most appropriate choice as it allows for a vaginal delivery, which aligns with the patient's wishes for a natural process. This method is commonly used for fetal demise in the second trimester and beyond.",9
8103,"The patient's symptoms of difficulty speaking and swallowing, blurry vision, and the presence of a mass in the anterior mediastinum suggest a thymoma. Thymomas are associated with myasthenia gravis, which can cause the described symptoms due to acetylcholine receptor antibodies affecting neuromuscular transmission. The CT findings of a mass with irregular borders and coarse calcifications further support this diagnosis. Thymomas often contain immature T-cells, which are double-positive for CD4 and CD8. Therefore, the immunotyping of the biopsy sample would most likely show cells that are double-positive for CD4 and CD8.",9
8120,"The clinical presentation and ultrasound findings suggest a molar pregnancy, specifically a complete hydatidiform mole. The key features include painless vaginal bleeding, significantly elevated serum HCG levels, and the ultrasound showing a 'snowstorm' pattern without a fetus. Complete moles are typically associated with a karyotype of 46XX, where all the genetic material is paternal in origin due to fertilization of an empty egg by a single sperm that duplicates its chromosomes.",9
8114,"The patient has chronic kidney disease with significant renal impairment, as indicated by the elevated creatinine and urea nitrogen levels. She also has metabolic acidosis (low bicarbonate and low pH) and hyperkalemia, which are complications of advanced kidney disease. Her symptoms of fatigue, loss of appetite, itching, and edema are consistent with uremia. 

In terms of long-term treatment options:

- **Cadaveric kidney transplant (A)** and **Living donor kidney transplant (C)** both offer the potential for improved quality of life and survival compared to dialysis. However, living donor transplants generally have better outcomes, including longer graft survival and shorter wait times.

- **Fluid restriction (B)** is a supportive measure but does not address the underlying renal failure.

- **Peritoneal dialysis (D)** is a form of renal replacement therapy that can improve symptoms and quality of life but does not offer the same survival benefit as a successful kidney transplant.

Given the options, a living donor kidney transplant (C) is the best choice for maximizing survival and improving quality of life.",9
8118,"The patient's symptoms include pain and weakness in the forearm and hand, specifically marked weakness in extending the right middle finger and radial deviation on wrist extension. These symptoms suggest an issue with the muscles innervated by the radial nerve or its branches. The radial deviation on wrist extension indicates weakness of the extensor carpi ulnaris, which is innervated by the posterior interosseous nerve (a branch of the radial nerve). The inability to extend the middle finger suggests involvement of the extensor digitorum, also innervated by the posterior interosseous nerve. The lack of sensory impairment further supports this, as the posterior interosseous nerve is a motor nerve. Therefore, the nerve most likely affected is the posterior interosseous nerve.",9
8124,"The patient has been diagnosed with Bordetella pertussis, which causes whooping cough. In such cases, close contacts, especially those who are at high risk or in close contact with high-risk individuals, should receive prophylactic treatment. 

A. Her 3-month-old brother should be treated with azithromycin as prophylaxis. - This is correct because infants are at high risk for severe pertussis, and azithromycin is recommended for prophylaxis in close contacts, especially in infants.

B. Her classmates should be treated with clarithromycin as prophylaxis. - While prophylaxis might be considered for close contacts, azithromycin is more commonly used, and not all classmates would necessarily need prophylaxis unless they are close contacts.

C. She will have lifelong natural immunity against Bordetella pertussis. - This is incorrect because natural infection does not confer lifelong immunity.

D. Her classmates should receive a TdaP booster regardless of their vaccination status. - This is not standard practice; vaccination status should be assessed, and boosters are given based on guidelines.

Therefore, the correct answer is A.",9
8128,"The patient presents with abdominal distension, shifting dullness indicating ascites, and malignant cells found on paracentesis. An adnexal mass is also noted on ultrasound. These findings suggest a malignant ovarian tumor. Among the options, mucinous cystadenocarcinoma is a type of malignant ovarian tumor that can cause ascites and present with an adnexal mass. Endometrioma and benign cystic teratoma are typically benign and less likely to present with malignant cells in ascites. Choriocarcinoma is a malignant tumor but is more commonly associated with gestational trophoblastic disease rather than an adnexal mass. Therefore, the most likely cause is mucinous cystadenocarcinoma.",9
8131,"The patient is an 8-year-old girl with symptoms consistent with asthma, including episodic dry cough, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and wheezing. Her pulmonary function test shows an FEV1 of 70%, indicating obstructive lung disease. The most effective treatment for reducing bronchial inflammation in asthma is an inhaled corticosteroid. Budesonide is an inhaled corticosteroid that reduces inflammation in the airways, making it the most appropriate choice for long-term management of asthma to control inflammation. Salmeterol is a long-acting beta-agonist, which is used for bronchodilation but does not address inflammation. Adenosine is not used in asthma treatment. Tiotropium is a long-acting anticholinergic used primarily in COPD. Therefore, the best choice for reducing bronchial inflammation is Budesonide.",9
8133,"The patient presents with a classic case of ""fight bite,"" which is a human bite wound on the hand. These wounds are at high risk for infection due to oral flora, including anaerobes and Eikenella corrodens. The patient is allergic to penicillin, which rules out the use of amoxicillin-clavulanate, a common choice for such infections. Clindamycin plus doxycycline is a suitable alternative for covering both anaerobic bacteria and Eikenella, as well as other common pathogens. Additionally, irrigation and debridement are necessary to clean the wound and prevent further infection. Therefore, the most appropriate management strategy is to use clindamycin plus doxycycline along with irrigation and debridement.",9
8136,"The scenario describes a situation where myocytes are able to utilize glucose for a longer period under low-oxygen conditions, but the medium becomes acidified. This suggests that anaerobic glycolysis is being enhanced, leading to increased lactate production, which would acidify the medium. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is the enzyme responsible for converting pyruvate to lactate under anaerobic conditions. Activation of LDH would increase lactate production, explaining both the prolonged glucose utilization and the acidification of the medium.",9
8138,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with a migraine without aura, characterized by unilateral, pulsatile headache, nausea, and photophobia. The headaches are triggered by certain foods like chocolate and are not relieved by over-the-counter medications. For acute migraine treatment, triptans, which are 5-HT1B/D agonists, are commonly used as they specifically target the migraine pathophysiology by causing vasoconstriction and inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory neuropeptides. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for acute episodes in this case is a 5-HT1B/D agonist.",9
8135,"The patient is experiencing acute dystonia, a common side effect of antipsychotic medications like haloperidol. Acute dystonia is characterized by sustained muscle contractions, often involving the neck (torticollis), eyes (oculogyric crisis), or other muscle groups. The treatment for acute dystonia involves anticholinergic medications or antihistamines with anticholinergic properties. Benztropine, an anticholinergic, is commonly used to relieve these symptoms. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine used for anxiety or muscle relaxation but is not the first-line treatment for acute dystonia. Botulinum toxin is used for chronic dystonia, not acute cases. Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist used for conditions like Parkinson's disease or neuroleptic malignant syndrome, not for acute dystonia.",9
8147,"The patient presents with acute monoarticular arthritis, characterized by knee pain, swelling, warmth, and decreased range of motion. The elevated white blood cell count and ESR suggest an inflammatory or infectious process. Given the acute presentation and systemic signs, septic arthritis must be ruled out. Synovial fluid analysis is crucial to differentiate between septic arthritis, gout, and other inflammatory arthritides. Therefore, the best next step is to perform a synovial fluid analysis to identify the cause of the arthritis.",9
8145,"The patient is pregnant and has a history of grand mal seizures, for which she is taking lamotrigine. Lamotrigine is generally considered safer than other antiepileptic drugs in pregnancy, but it is still important to minimize the risk of congenital malformations. Folic acid supplementation is known to reduce the risk of neural tube defects, which are a concern with antiepileptic drugs. While decreasing alcohol consumption is generally advisable, the patient only drinks socially, and there is no indication of excessive alcohol use. Switching to another antiepileptic medication could potentially increase the risk of congenital malformations, as many other antiepileptics have higher teratogenic risks. Switching antibiotics from amoxicillin to cephalexin is not relevant to reducing congenital malformations. Therefore, folic acid supplementation is the most appropriate measure to decrease the risk of congenital malformations in this scenario.",9
8144,"The patient presents with lower abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and a positive pregnancy test with a β-hCG level that is not rising appropriately (from 1,600 to 1,900 mIU/mL over 4 days). This suggests a possible ectopic pregnancy, especially given her history of pelvic inflammatory disease, which is a risk factor. The ultrasound shows an empty uterus and free pelvic fluid, further supporting the suspicion of an ectopic pregnancy. 

The patient is RhD negative, so she should receive anti-D immunoglobulin to prevent Rh sensitization. Methotrexate is used to medically manage an ectopic pregnancy. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to administer both anti-D immunoglobulin and methotrexate.",9
8159,"The patient was involved in a high-speed motorcycle accident and had an impact on the epigastric region. Initially, the CT scan showed no abnormalities, and he was discharged. However, he returns four days later with worsening upper abdominal pain, fever, poor appetite, and vomiting. These symptoms suggest a delayed complication of the initial trauma. 

A pancreatic ductal injury is a possible complication of blunt abdominal trauma, especially with an impact on the epigastric region. Such injuries may not be immediately apparent on initial imaging and can present later with symptoms of pancreatitis or a pancreatic pseudocyst, which align with the patient's current symptoms.

Aortic dissection is unlikely given the mechanism of injury and the absence of chest pain or signs of vascular compromise.

Abdominal compartment syndrome typically presents with severe abdominal distension and compromised organ function, which is not consistent with this patient's presentation.

Splenic rupture would likely have presented with signs of hemorrhagic shock or peritoneal irritation earlier, and the initial CT scan would likely have shown abnormalities.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a pancreatic ductal injury.",9
8161,"The patient is presenting with fetal macrosomia, which is often associated with maternal diabetes, particularly gestational diabetes. Given her high BMI and lack of prenatal care, she is at increased risk for gestational diabetes. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is the standard diagnostic test for gestational diabetes, which is a common cause of fetal macrosomia. While glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) can indicate long-term glucose control, it is not the standard test for diagnosing gestational diabetes during pregnancy. C-peptide and leptin are not standard tests for diagnosing the cause of fetal macrosomia in this context.",9
8168,"The clinical presentation of this patient includes unconsciousness, bilateral mydriasis (dilated pupils), fever, ventricular tachycardia, seizure, hypertension, and metabolic acidosis (indicated by low serum bicarbonate). These symptoms are consistent with sympathomimetic toxicity. Cocaine is a sympathomimetic drug that can cause hyperthermia, seizures, dilated pupils, cardiovascular complications like ventricular tachycardia, and metabolic acidosis. The elevated creatinine phosphatase may indicate muscle breakdown, which can occur due to seizures or hyperthermia. PCP (phencyclidine) can also cause seizures and hypertension but is more associated with nystagmus and does not typically cause ventricular tachycardia. MPTP is associated with Parkinsonism, and opioids typically cause miosis (constricted pupils) rather than mydriasis. Therefore, the most likely drug causing this presentation is cocaine.",9
8171,"The patient presents with acute onset of right-sided weakness and speech difficulties, suggesting a possible stroke. Given the sudden onset and the fact that he was last seen normal 2 hours ago, this could be an ischemic stroke. The first step in managing a suspected stroke is to determine if it is ischemic or hemorrhagic, as this will guide treatment. A noncontrast head CT is the fastest way to rule out hemorrhage. If no hemorrhage is present, thrombolytics can be considered if within the appropriate time window. Therefore, the best next step is to perform a noncontrast head CT.",9
8166,"The clinical presentation described in the question is characteristic of achondroplasia, a common form of dwarfism. Key features include disproportionate short stature with rhizomelic shortening of the limbs, macrocephaly (large head circumference), and normal intelligence. Achondroplasia is caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene. The mode of inheritance for achondroplasia is autosomal dominant. Most cases are due to new mutations, but when inherited, it follows an autosomal dominant pattern.",10
8170,"The patient's symptoms of right lower quadrant pain and recent bleeding, despite surgical sterilization, raise suspicion for a possible ectopic pregnancy. Surgical sterilization is not 100% effective, and ectopic pregnancy can still occur. The absence of McBurney's point tenderness makes appendicitis less likely. The best next step is to confirm or rule out pregnancy, as this will guide further management. A urinary hCG test is a quick and non-invasive way to check for pregnancy.",9
8173,"The patient's symptoms and history are suggestive of chronic bronchitis, a form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) commonly associated with long-term smoking. Chronic bronchitis is characterized by chronic inflammation of the bronchi, leading to increased mucus production. This is due to hyperplasia and hypertrophy of mucus-secreting glands and goblet cells in the airway epithelium. The persistent cough with thick, yellow sputum and the history of smoking support this diagnosis. Therefore, the microscopic examination of a lung biopsy in this patient is most likely to show increased goblet cells.",9
8175,"The patient's symptoms include a pervasive distrust and suspicion of others, believing without sufficient basis that his neighbors are trying to harm him by tampering with his food. He also believes that others, including his physician, are against him. These symptoms align with Paranoid Personality Disorder, which is characterized by a pattern of distrust and suspiciousness such that others' motives are interpreted as malevolent. Schizoid Personality Disorder involves detachment from social relationships and a restricted range of emotional expression, which does not fit this case. Intermittent Explosive Disorder involves episodes of losing control and aggression, which is not the primary issue here. Borderline Personality Disorder involves instability in relationships, self-image, and affects, along with marked impulsivity, which also does not fit this scenario. Therefore, the most likely personality disorder is Paranoid Personality Disorder.",9
8177,"The clinical presentation of the child is consistent with measles, which is caused by the Morbillivirus. The key features include the maculopapular rash that starts on the face and spreads to the trunk and extremities, along with the presence of Koplik spots (irregularly-shaped red dots on the mucosa), which are pathognomonic for measles. The child has not received the MMR vaccine, which includes protection against measles, mumps, and rubella, increasing the likelihood of measles infection. The symptoms of fever, cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis further support this diagnosis. Rubulavirus is associated with mumps, Influenzavirus with influenza, and Group A Streptococcus with bacterial infections like strep throat, none of which match the full clinical picture described.",9
8172,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease (PAD), including claudication, loss of hair, decreased skin temperature, and absent pedal pulses. His symptoms have not improved with supervised exercise therapy, which is the first-line treatment for claudication. Given his history of smoking and diabetes, he is at high risk for PAD. The next step in management for claudication that does not improve with exercise therapy is pharmacologic treatment. Cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, is the most appropriate medication to improve claudication symptoms. Compression stockings are not indicated for PAD, and surgical interventions like endarterectomy or bypass surgery are reserved for more severe cases or critical limb ischemia.",9
8178,"The child presents with symptoms suggestive of asthma, including coughing, nasal congestion, and intermittent wheezing, along with a history of eczema, which is associated with atopic conditions. The recent move to affordable housing could have introduced new environmental allergens, potentially exacerbating his symptoms. Spirometry is the most appropriate next step to assess lung function and confirm an asthma diagnosis. Skin prick testing could identify specific allergens but is not the immediate next step in management. Throat culture is not relevant to the symptoms presented, and the dihydrorhodamine 123 test is used for diagnosing chronic granulomatous disease, which is not indicated here.",9
8183,"The patient is exhibiting signs of malignant hyperthermia, a life-threatening condition often triggered by certain anesthetic agents like isoflurane and succinylcholine. Symptoms include hypercarbia, muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, and autonomic instability. The underlying mechanism involves uncontrolled calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle due to a defect in the ryanodine receptor. The treatment for malignant hyperthermia is dantrolene, which acts as a ryanodine receptor antagonist, reducing calcium release and alleviating symptoms.",9
8182,"The patient presents with signs and symptoms suggestive of ischemic colitis, particularly affecting the splenic flexure and descending colon. The splenic flexure is a watershed area between the blood supply of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). The descending colon is primarily supplied by branches of the IMA. The left colic artery, a branch of the IMA, supplies the descending colon and the splenic flexure. Therefore, the left colic artery is the vessel that contributes the most to the delivery of blood to the affected area in this case.",9
8181,"The quadruple test is a prenatal screening test that measures four substances in a pregnant woman's blood: alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), unconjugated estriol, beta-hCG, and inhibin A. The pattern of results can indicate the risk of certain conditions in the fetus. In this case, the results show low AFP, low unconjugated estriol, high beta-hCG, and high inhibin A. This pattern is characteristic of Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). In Trisomy 21, AFP and estriol are typically low, while hCG and inhibin A are elevated. Neural tube defects are usually associated with elevated AFP. Congenital toxoplasmosis and trophoblastic disease do not have this specific pattern of markers.",9
8191,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a subdural hematoma, which is consistent with her history of a fall and use of anticoagulation (warfarin). The CT scan (not shown here) would likely reveal a crescent-shaped hematoma, typical of a subdural hematoma. Subdural hematomas are usually caused by the rupture of cerebral bridging veins, which can occur due to trauma, especially in the elderly or those on anticoagulation therapy. The symptoms of decreased consciousness, headache, and focal neurological deficits (such as the right-sided weakness and increased tone) align with this diagnosis. The inability to abduct both eyes could be due to increased intracranial pressure affecting cranial nerve function. Other options, such as rupture of the middle meningeal artery, would lead to an epidural hematoma, and rupture of a saccular aneurysm would typically cause a subarachnoid hemorrhage, neither of which fit the clinical picture as well as a subdural hematoma does.",9
8188,"The patient's symptoms and the positive nasopharyngeal viral culture for an orthomyxovirus suggest an influenza infection. Influenza viruses are known for causing seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics. The influenza virus is an RNA virus with a segmented genome, which allows for genetic reassortment. Reassortment occurs when two different strains of influenza viruses infect the same cell and exchange genetic material, leading to a new viral strain. This process is responsible for the emergence of novel influenza strains that can cause pandemics, as the new strain may not be recognized by the immune system of the population. This is distinct from antigenic drift, which involves smaller mutations and is responsible for seasonal epidemics. Therefore, the mechanism responsible for pandemics of influenza is reassortment.",9
8160,,0
6170,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a deficiency in niacin (vitamin B3), leading to pellagra. Pellagra is characterized by the ""3 D's"": dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia. The rash described is consistent with the dermatitis seen in pellagra, which is often symmetrical and occurs in sun-exposed areas. The patient's history of incarceration and possible malnutrition, along with his symptoms of diarrhea and cognitive difficulties, support this diagnosis. Pellagra can be associated with conditions that lead to decreased tryptophan availability, as tryptophan is a precursor for niacin synthesis. Malignant carcinoid syndrome can cause increased metabolism of tryptophan into serotonin, reducing its availability for niacin production, leading to pellagra-like symptoms. Therefore, the correct association is with malignant carcinoid syndrome.",9
6162,"The patient presents with back pain, fever, tachycardia, and elevated inflammatory markers (leukocytosis, ESR, and CRP). These findings suggest an infectious process. Given the patient's history of IV drug use, he is at increased risk for infections such as osteomyelitis, particularly in the spine. The tenderness over the thoracic spine further supports a localized infection. Degenerative spine disease, herniated nucleus pulposus, and musculoskeletal strain are less likely to present with fever and elevated inflammatory markers. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is osteomyelitis.",9
6171,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest an immunocompromised state, likely due to HIV/AIDS, given her risk factors and presentation. The white plaques on the tongue that cannot be scraped off are indicative of oral hairy leukoplakia, often associated with HIV. The chest x-ray findings of diffuse interstitial infiltrates, along with her respiratory symptoms, suggest Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients.

The standard treatment for PJP is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). However, this patient has a severe allergy to sulfa drugs, making TMP-SMX contraindicated. The alternative treatment for PJP in patients with a sulfa allergy is clindamycin and primaquine.

Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient, considering her sulfa allergy, is intravenous clindamycin and oral primaquine.",9
6173,"The patient's symptoms, including generalized redness, urticaria, shortness of breath, wheezing, and hypotension, are indicative of an anaphylactic reaction. Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction that occurs rapidly after exposure to an allergen, in this case, peanuts. This type of reaction is mediated by IgE antibodies that trigger mast cell and basophil degranulation, leading to the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators. This process is characteristic of an immediate hypersensitivity reaction, also known as Type I hypersensitivity. The other options do not fit this clinical scenario: Type II hypersensitivity involves antibody-mediated cytotoxicity, serum sickness is a Type III hypersensitivity reaction involving immune complexes, and contact dermatitis is a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction involving delayed-type hypersensitivity.",9
6169,"The patient has been diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma, and the next step is to stage the cancer to determine the extent of disease and guide treatment. CT of the abdomen and pelvis is often used initially to assess for local and distant spread of gastric cancer. While PET-CT and MRI can provide additional information, CT is more widely used for initial staging. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is valuable for assessing the depth of tumor invasion and local lymph node involvement but is typically done after CT scans in the staging process.",9
6185,"The key points in this case are the red discoloration with a rectangular shape over the buttock, tenderness, and the recent history of an upper respiratory infection. The shape and location of the lesion, along with tenderness, suggest a possible traumatic origin. However, the mother denies any injury, and the child has a family history of hemophilia A, which could suggest a bleeding disorder. However, hemophilia typically presents with joint bleeding or deep muscle hematomas, not superficial bruising. Erythema multiforme minor is usually associated with target lesions and is not typically tender. Diaper dermatitis would be expected in the diaper area and is usually not rectangular or tender. The shape and tenderness of the lesion, along with the lack of other systemic symptoms, make an abusive bruise the most likely diagnosis, especially considering the concern about the shape and the lack of a plausible accidental explanation.",9
6174,"The patient's symptoms and findings suggest obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which is characterized by snoring, choking during sleep, and daytime tiredness. OSA can lead to chronic hypoxia due to repeated episodes of apnea during sleep. This chronic hypoxia can cause pulmonary hypertension, leading to right heart strain, which is evidenced by the jugular venous distention, lower extremity edema, and right axis deviation on ECG. The clear lungs on auscultation and the absence of coronary artery disease symptoms make coronary artery disease less likely. Alveolar destruction is more associated with conditions like emphysema, which would typically present with different lung findings. Hypertensive nephropathy would not directly cause the respiratory and cardiac findings seen here. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is chronic hypoxia due to obstructive sleep apnea.",9
6210,"The patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest an inflammatory bowel disease, specifically Crohn's disease. The CT scan shows mural thickening and fat stranding in the terminal ileum and transverse colon, which are common sites affected by Crohn's disease. The laboratory findings of elevated leukocyte count and ESR indicate inflammation. The most specific histological finding for Crohn's disease is the presence of non-caseating granulomas. While inflammation of the terminal ileum is common in Crohn's, it is not specific as it can occur in other conditions. Neutrophilic inflammation of the crypts is more associated with ulcerative colitis. Intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusion bodies are not related to Crohn's disease but rather to viral infections. Therefore, the most specific finding for Crohn's disease is non-caseating granulomas.",9
6200,"The patient presents with hypercalcemia (serum calcium of 11.1 mg/dL) and an elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of 700 pg/mL. In the context of hypercalcemia, a high PTH level suggests primary hyperparathyroidism or a condition where the parathyroid glands are not responding appropriately to the high calcium levels.

The urine calcium level is low (100 mg/24h), which is not typical for primary hyperparathyroidism, where you would expect hypercalciuria due to increased calcium reabsorption in the kidneys. This suggests that the kidneys are not excreting calcium as expected, which is characteristic of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH).

FHH is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), leading to decreased sensitivity to calcium levels. This results in higher serum calcium levels and inappropriately normal or elevated PTH levels, with low urinary calcium excretion.

Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is a loss-of-function mutation in the calcium-sensing receptor, leading to familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia.",9
6222,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a corneal abrasion, likely due to contact lens use. The key symptom is the foreign body sensation and pain that is relieved by topical anesthetic, indicating a superficial corneal issue. Fluorescein examination is the most appropriate diagnostic test for corneal abrasions as it will reveal any epithelial defects on the cornea by staining them, allowing for visualization under a blue light. Other options like ocular ultrasonography, gonioscopy, and CT scan are not suitable for diagnosing corneal abrasions.",9
6212,"The scenario describes a situation where Escherichia coli, which harbors a plasmid with kanamycin resistance, is mixed with Staphylococcus aureus in a medium containing deoxyribonuclease (DNase). DNase would degrade free DNA in the medium, ruling out transformation as a mechanism since transformation involves uptake of free DNA. Conjugation involves direct cell-to-cell contact and transfer of plasmids, which is possible between bacteria, but typically occurs between bacteria of the same species or closely related species. Transposition involves movement of transposons within or between DNA molecules, but it requires the presence of the transposon in the recipient, which is not indicated here. Transduction involves the transfer of genetic material via bacteriophages. However, the key point here is that the kanamycin resistance gene is not found in the chromosomal DNA of the resistant S. aureus, suggesting that the resistance is plasmid-mediated. Conjugation is the most likely mechanism here, as it can transfer plasmids between bacteria, even between different species, and does not require free DNA in the medium.",9
6241,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest digoxin toxicity. He has a history of congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation, conditions often treated with digoxin. The symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, confusion, and blurry vision are consistent with digoxin toxicity. Additionally, the bradycardia (pulse of 57/min) and hyperkalemia (K+ of 5.3 mEq/L) are indicative of digoxin's effects. The ECG showing premature ventricular beats also aligns with digoxin toxicity, which can cause various arrhythmias. Digoxin works by inhibiting the Na+/K+-ATPase pump, leading to increased intracellular calcium and increased cardiac contractility. Therefore, the mechanism of action of the drug responsible for the symptoms is the inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase.",9
6144,,0
6242,"The patient presents with poor feeding, irritability, vomiting, and failure to thrive. The laboratory findings show a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis (low HCO3- and low pH) with hypokalemia (low K+). The urine pH is 6.9, which is inappropriately high given the metabolic acidosis. This suggests a renal tubular acidosis (RTA). Specifically, the inability to acidify the urine despite systemic acidosis points towards a distal (type 1) RTA, where there is an inability of the distal tubule to secrete hydrogen ions (H+). This is consistent with option C.",9
6247,"The clinical presentation of this 4-year-old boy suggests a retropharyngeal abscess, given the fever, neck stiffness, drooling, and bulge in the posterior pharyngeal wall. The presence of inspiratory stridor and labored breathing indicates potential airway compromise. In such cases, securing the airway is the priority to prevent respiratory failure. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to ensure the airway is protected, which is achieved through endotracheal intubation.",9
6147,,0
6258,"The patient presents with white plaques in the mouth that bleed when scraped off, which is characteristic of oral candidiasis (thrush). This condition is common in immunocompromised patients, such as those undergoing chemotherapy. The next best step in management for oral candidiasis is antifungal treatment. Topical nystatin is an appropriate choice for treating oral thrush. Culturing the lesions or performing a biopsy is unnecessary for a straightforward case of oral candidiasis, and topical corticosteroids are not indicated for this condition.",9
6249,"The patient is Rh-negative and the father is Rh-positive, which puts the baby at risk for Rh(D) alloimmunization if the baby is Rh-positive. If the mother becomes sensitized to Rh(D) antigen, her immune system may produce antibodies that can cross the placenta in future pregnancies and attack the red blood cells of an Rh-positive fetus, leading to hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN). Rho(D) immune globulin (RhoGAM) is given to prevent the mother's immune system from becoming sensitized to Rh(D) antigen. It is typically administered at around 28 weeks of gestation and within 72 hours after delivery if the baby is Rh-positive. Option B is correct because it addresses the prevention of Rh(D) alloimmunization, which is the primary purpose of administering RhoGAM. Option A is incorrect because RhoGAM is not needed both before and immediately after delivery for the current pregnancy, but rather to prevent sensitization for future pregnancies. Option C is incorrect because RhoGAM specifically targets Rh(D) antigen and not other Rh antigens. Option D is incorrect because the risk of complications from Rh(D) alloimmunization can be significant in future pregnancies.",9
6250,"Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) are known to reduce the risk of endometrial and ovarian cancers due to the suppression of ovulation and the regulation of the endometrial lining. While COCs are associated with an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and hepatic adenomas, they do not reduce the risk of these conditions. There is no significant evidence that COCs reduce the risk of malignant melanoma. Therefore, the condition for which COCs significantly reduce the risk is endometrial cancer.",9
6268,"The boy's presentation is consistent with endemic Burkitt's lymphoma, which is commonly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and is prevalent in equatorial Africa. This form of Burkitt's lymphoma often presents with jaw involvement. The key factor in this case is the boy's recent immigration from equatorial Africa, where this type of lymphoma is endemic. While the infected ulcer and family history of HIV are relevant to his overall health, they are not directly associated with the jaw involvement seen in endemic Burkitt's lymphoma. The gender of the patient is also not a determining factor in this specific presentation.",9

6287,"The clinical scenario describes a patient who meets the criteria for brain death. The absence of brainstem reflexes (such as corneal, gag, and oculovestibular reflexes), dilated and nonreactive pupils, and a positive apnea test all indicate brain death. In the context of brain death, the patient is legally considered dead. Therefore, further imaging like a CT scan is unnecessary, and a court order for management is not typically required since brain death is a medically and legally recognized state of death. Consulting the ethics committee may be part of the hospital protocol, but it is not necessary for management following brain death determination. The most appropriate next step in management, given the absence of family or advance directives, is to remove the ventilator as the patient is considered legally dead.",9

6295,"The scenario describes a man with an intense fear of spiders, which is consistent with a specific phobia. The best treatment for specific phobias is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), particularly exposure therapy, which helps patients gradually face and overcome their fears. Anxiolytics and beta-blockers might provide temporary relief of anxiety symptoms but do not address the underlying phobia. Antidepressants are not typically first-line treatments for specific phobias unless there is a comorbid condition like depression or generalized anxiety disorder.",9
6293,"The patient has cystic fibrosis and presents with symptoms and imaging findings suggestive of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), which is common in cystic fibrosis patients. The elevated IgE and eosinophilia further support this diagnosis. ABPA is typically associated with Aspergillus species, which are characterized by monomorphic, septate hyphae that branch at acute angles. Therefore, a sputum culture in this context is most likely to grow Aspergillus species.",9
6271,"The patient presents with metabolic alkalosis (elevated bicarbonate level of 29 mEq/L) and hypokalemia (potassium level of 3.5 mEq/L). Her urine chemistry shows very low urinary chloride (4 mEq/L), which suggests either volume depletion or a condition that mimics it. The low respiratory rate of 9/min might indicate compensation for metabolic alkalosis or could be related to clonazepam use.

The family history does not directly suggest genetic disorders typically associated with metabolic alkalosis. The patient's normal blood pressure and lack of significant electrolyte imbalances such as hypocalcemia (calcium is 10.2 mg/dL) make Gitelman syndrome less likely, as it usually presents with hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalciuria.

Diuretic abuse is a potential cause of hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with low urine chloride due to volume depletion, but the history does not suggest this (no mention of weight control behaviors to align with misuse).

Anorexia nervosa might also present with hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis due to vomiting, but there's no specific evidence of anorexia behavior.

Bulimia nervosa, which involves episodes of binge eating followed by purging (e.g., vomiting), can result in a similar profile with low urine chloride due to the body's attempt to conserve chloride in the setting of vomiting. The low urine chloride aligns with volume depletion secondary to vomiting.",9
6310,"The patient's symptoms and recent travel history to Wuhan, China, suggest a possible infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. This virus is known to cause respiratory symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, and fever, and it emerged from Wuhan. The chest X-ray findings of bilateral patchy infiltrates are consistent with viral pneumonia, which can be seen in COVID-19. The sputum culture showing no gram-staining organisms and negative cold agglutinins further supports a viral rather than bacterial cause. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that is single-stranded, enveloped, and has a positive-sense, helical structure. Therefore, the description that matches SARS-CoV-2 is: RNA | single-stranded | envelope: yes | positive-sense, helical.",10
6303,"The clinical presentation of the patient suggests a hemolytic anemia, characterized by jaundice, pallor, and hematuria. The peripheral blood smear findings of fragmented RBCs, microspherocytes, and bite cells are indicative of oxidative damage to red blood cells. This is commonly seen in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, which leads to a lack of NADPH production. NADPH is crucial for maintaining the reduced form of glutathione, which protects red blood cells from oxidative damage. The reaction catalyzed by G6PD is the conversion of D-glucose-6-phosphate and NADP+ to 6-phospho-D-glucono-1,5-lactone and NADPH. Therefore, the enzyme deficiency in this patient is most likely related to this reaction.",9

6320,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest hemochromatosis, a condition characterized by excessive iron deposition in various organs. Key features include hyperpigmentation (bronze skin), diabetes mellitus (""bronze diabetes""), hypogonadism (reduced libido and testicular atrophy), and arthropathy (joint pain, particularly in the hands). The elevated liver enzymes and hepatomegaly suggest liver involvement. Hemochromatosis significantly increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma due to chronic liver damage and cirrhosis. The ferritin level, while not extremely high, could still be consistent with early hemochromatosis, especially considering the clinical presentation. Therefore, the greatest risk for this patient is developing hepatocellular carcinoma.",9
6277,,0
6337,"The patient's symptoms of hallucinations and auditory disturbances following surgery are suggestive of emergence delirium, which is commonly associated with the use of certain anesthetics. Ketamine is an anesthetic known for causing such symptoms due to its mechanism of action as an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. This mechanism can lead to dissociative anesthesia and is associated with post-operative hallucinations and delirium. Other options, such as increased duration of GABA-gated chloride channel opening (A), stimulation of μ-opioid receptors (C), and blocking fast voltage-gated Na+ channels (D), are mechanisms of other anesthetics or analgesics that do not typically cause these specific symptoms.",9
6336,"The boy is experiencing excessive daytime sleepiness and below-average school performance, likely due to insufficient sleep. He goes to bed at midnight and wakes up at 7 am, getting only 7 hours of sleep, which is below the recommended 8-10 hours for teenagers. His sleep schedule on weekends suggests a sleep deficit during the week. There are no signs of sleep apnea or other sleep disorders, and his lifestyle is otherwise healthy. Increasing nighttime sleep hours by going to bed earlier would help address the sleep deficit and improve daytime alertness and school performance.",9
6342,"The patient's symptoms and findings suggest an inflammatory bowel disease. The presence of diarrhea with blood, abdominal discomfort, and cramping are common in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. However, the key distinguishing features here are the involvement of both the colon and terminal ileum, as seen on colonoscopy, and the presence of a perirectal abscess. Crohn's disease is known for its ability to affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus and often presents with skip lesions, which are scattered mucosal lesions. It is also associated with complications such as fistulas and abscesses, which aligns with the finding of a perirectal abscess in this patient. Ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, typically involves continuous lesions starting from the rectum and does not affect the ileum or cause perirectal abscesses. The blood test results showing anemia and elevated white blood cell count with a slightly elevated ESR further support an inflammatory process consistent with Crohn's disease.",9
6348,"The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus, a BMI indicating obesity, and elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), which are common in liver conditions associated with metabolic syndrome. The liver biopsy shows hepatocyte ballooning degeneration and inflammatory infiltrates, which are characteristic of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is part of the spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), often associated with obesity and diabetes. The absence of significant alcohol use and the presence of metabolic risk factors make NASH the most likely diagnosis. Primary biliary cirrhosis and autoimmune hepatitis are less likely given the biopsy findings and lack of other supporting clinical features. Viral hepatitis is also less likely without additional risk factors or serological evidence.",9
6352,"At 13 months, a child is expected to be able to pull to stand and possibly take a few steps. This child cannot pull to stand, indicating a delay in gross motor skills. Fine motor skills are assessed by the ability to pick up objects with a pincer grasp, which she can do, so her fine motor skills are normal. Language development at this age typically includes saying a few words like ""mama"" and ""dada,"" and she coos ""ma"" and ""ba,"" which is within the normal range for language development. Socially, she responds to her name, plays with a ball, and shows separation anxiety, which are normal social behaviors for her age. Therefore, the most appropriate assessment is: Fine motor: normal | Gross motor: delayed | Language: normal | Social skills: normal.",9
6365,"The patient is in respiratory distress with a low oxygen saturation and has failed an initial attempt at endotracheal intubation. Given the urgency of the situation and the need to secure the airway quickly, a cricothyrotomy is the most appropriate next step. Video laryngoscopy could be considered if available and if the situation allows for another attempt at intubation, but in an emergency where rapid airway access is needed, cricothyrotomy is preferred. Comfort measures only are not appropriate given the acute nature of the situation and the lack of an advance directive. Tracheostomy is not suitable in this emergency setting due to the time it takes to perform.",9
6329,"The patient's presentation of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea with multiple episodes per day suggests an infection with an organism that causes inflammatory diarrhea. The most common bacterial causes of bloody diarrhea include Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, and enterohemorrhagic E. coli. 

- **Clostridium difficile** typically causes watery diarrhea and is often associated with recent antibiotic use or hospitalization. It is less likely to cause bloody diarrhea unless there is significant colonic damage.

- **Campylobacter** is a common cause of bloody diarrhea and is often associated with undercooked poultry. It can cause abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, fitting this patient's symptoms.

- **Salmonella** can cause bloody diarrhea, especially in cases of Salmonella enteritidis, but it is more commonly associated with non-bloody diarrhea.

- **Shigella** is known for causing dysentery, which includes bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus. It is highly infectious and can cause symptoms similar to those described.

Given the symptoms of bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain, both Campylobacter and Shigella are strong contenders. However, Campylobacter is more commonly associated with the presentation described in adults in the United States.

Therefore, the most likely pathogen responsible for her presentation is Campylobacter.",9
6343,"The presentation of a skin lesion along with synchronous spasmodic movements suggests a condition that involves both dermatological and neurological manifestations. The key here is the combination of a skin lesion and movement disorders. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is characterized by skin lesions such as hypomelanotic macules, facial angiofibromas, and shagreen patches, along with neurological symptoms like seizures and spasms. The genetic basis for TSC involves mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. The presence of skin lesions and spasmodic movements in this child is consistent with tuberous sclerosis complex, making TSC1 the gene involved in this condition.",9
6371,"The patient presents with a sudden and severe headache, vomiting, and difficulty walking, which are concerning for a hemorrhagic event. His history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation, along with anticoagulation therapy (rivaroxaban), increases the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. The headache is localized to the back of the head, and the neurological exam shows nystagmus, ataxia, and facial weakness, which are indicative of cerebellar involvement. These findings are consistent with a cerebellar hemorrhage, which can cause occipital headache, ataxia, and cranial nerve abnormalities. Pontine hemorrhage would likely cause more severe symptoms such as coma or quadriplegia. Thalamic hemorrhage typically presents with sensory deficits and altered consciousness. Subarachnoid hemorrhage usually presents with a ""thunderclap"" headache and neck stiffness, but the cerebellar signs are more specific for cerebellar hemorrhage.",9
6406,"The infant has been exposed to hepatitis B virus (HBV) from the mother, who is a carrier of the virus. In neonates, the immune system is not fully developed, which often results in a high likelihood of chronic HBV infection if exposed at birth. This is because the immune system does not mount a strong response to clear the virus, leading to a higher risk of chronic infection. Chronic HBV infection in infants is often characterized by minimal liver inflammation, so significant elevation of transaminases is not expected. Therefore, the most accurate statement regarding the infant's condition is that significant elevation of transaminases is not expected.",9
6377,"The question describes regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are crucial for maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmune responses. These cells are characterized by the expression of CD4, CD25, and the transcription factor Foxp3. Tregs are known to secrete cytokines that help suppress immune responses. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a key anti-inflammatory cytokine secreted by Tregs, which helps in inhibiting the activation and function of other immune cells, thereby maintaining tolerance and preventing autoimmunity. The other interleukins listed do not fit the profile of cytokines typically secreted by Tregs: IL-2 is more involved in T cell growth, IL-12 is involved in Th1 differentiation, and IL-17 is associated with pro-inflammatory responses by Th17 cells.",9
6415,"The patient presents with a history suggestive of primary syphilis, characterized by a painless chancre that resolved spontaneously. The positive VDRL and FTA-ABS tests confirm the diagnosis of syphilis. In this case, the patient likely has latent syphilis, as he is asymptomatic and the initial lesion has resolved. The standard treatment for syphilis, including latent syphilis, is penicillin. Acyclovir is used for herpes infections, and azithromycin with ceftriaxone is used for gonorrhea and chlamydia. Therefore, the most appropriate management is penicillin.",9
6419,"The patient is a 70-year-old female presenting with symptoms consistent with Alzheimer's disease, including forgetfulness, difficulty with daily activities, and a mini-mental status exam score of 19/30, indicating moderate cognitive impairment. The MRI shows diffuse cortical atrophy, which is typical in Alzheimer's disease. The best initial treatment for Alzheimer's disease, especially in the early to moderate stages, is a cholinesterase inhibitor. Rivastigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor and is appropriate for this stage of Alzheimer's disease. Memantine is typically used in moderate to severe stages, often in combination with a cholinesterase inhibitor. Bromocriptine and Pramipexole are used for Parkinson's disease, not Alzheimer's.",9
6416,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of acute rheumatic fever (ARF), which can occur after a streptococcal throat infection. The key features include migratory arthritis (pain in ankles, wrists, and knee), subcutaneous nodules (bumps on elbows), and carditis (chest pain relieved by leaning forward and pericardial friction rub). The histopathologic finding associated with ARF is the presence of Aschoff bodies, which are interstitial myocardial granulomas containing Anitschkow cells (plump macrophages with nuclei incorporating central wavy ribbons of chromatin). This matches the description in option D.",9
6444,"The patient initially presented with a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and was treated with low-molecular weight heparin. She now presents with a new DVT and a significant drop in platelet count, indicating heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT is a pro-thrombotic condition caused by antibodies against platelet factor 4 complexed with heparin, leading to platelet activation and thrombosis. In HIT, heparin must be stopped immediately, and anticoagulation should be continued with a non-heparin anticoagulant. Direct thrombin inhibitors, such as argatroban or bivalirudin, are commonly used in this scenario. Therefore, the most appropriate medication to initiate is a direct thrombin inhibitor.",9
4396,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are suggestive of polycythemia vera, a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by increased red blood cell mass. The key features include elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit, low erythropoietin levels, splenomegaly, and symptoms such as pruritus after bathing, headaches, and hypertension. The presence of a low erythropoietin level indicates that the polycythemia is not secondary to hypoxia or an erythropoietin-secreting tumor like renal cell carcinoma. The most common underlying cause of polycythemia vera is a mutation in the JAK2 gene, specifically JAK2 V617F, which leads to constitutive activation of the JAK2 tyrosine kinase and uncontrolled hematopoiesis.",9
6445,"The newborn in the scenario presents with features suggestive of Down syndrome, including low-set ears, upslanting palpebral fissures, and a hypoplastic fifth finger. Down syndrome is associated with several congenital heart defects, the most common of which is a complete atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD). Other cardiac anomalies can occur, but AVSD is the most characteristic and prevalent in patients with Down syndrome. The other options listed, such as aortic root dilation, bicuspid aortic valve, and coarctation of the aorta, are more commonly associated with other conditions like Marfan syndrome and Turner syndrome, respectively. Therefore, given the clinical presentation and the association with Down syndrome, the most likely cardiac finding in this patient is a complete atrioventricular septal defect.",9
4309,,0
6453,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of right-sided heart failure, including bilateral ankle swelling, jugular venous distention, and right axis deviation on ECG. His history of smoking and symptoms of snoring and choking during sleep suggest obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which can lead to chronic hypoxia. Chronic hypoxia from OSA or smoking can cause pulmonary hypertension, leading to right-sided heart failure. The clear lungs and absence of pulmonary edema make left-sided heart failure less likely. Chronic kidney damage would typically present with more systemic signs of fluid overload and not specifically right-sided heart failure. Alveolar destruction, as seen in emphysema, could contribute to hypoxia but is not directly indicated here. Therefore, chronic hypoxia is the most likely cause of the patient's condition.",9
6460,"The patient is presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of preeclampsia, which includes hypertension, proteinuria, and edema. Additionally, the laboratory findings show elevated liver transaminases (ALT and AST), which can be associated with severe preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets). The elevated AST (78 U/L) and ALT (67 U/L) indicate liver involvement, which is a criterion for severe preeclampsia. The other laboratory parameters such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, and creatinine do not specifically satisfy the criteria for preeclampsia or its severe forms. Therefore, the elevated liver transaminases are the laboratory parameters that satisfy the criteria for the patient's condition.",9
6462,"The patient presents with symptoms and lab findings consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a common complication of type I diabetes mellitus when insulin is not administered. In DKA, there is an osmotic diuresis due to high blood glucose levels, leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. The lab results show hyperglycemia, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and a low bicarbonate level, indicating a high anion gap metabolic acidosis.

In DKA, despite the serum potassium level being high or normal, there is a total body potassium depletion. This occurs because insulin deficiency and acidosis cause a shift of potassium from the intracellular to the extracellular space, and the osmotic diuresis leads to renal loss of potassium. Therefore, the total body stores of potassium are depleted even if the serum level appears elevated.

A. Signs of hypocalcemia are not typically associated with DKA.
B. Phosphate levels can be normal or low in DKA, but they are not the primary concern here.
C. Total body potassium depletion is a classic finding in DKA due to the reasons mentioned above.
D. Loss of sodium in urine is greater than free water loss is not a typical finding in DKA; rather, there is a loss of both sodium and water due to osmotic diuresis.",9
6463,"The newborn's heart rate is 70/min, which is below the normal range (>100/min) and indicates bradycardia. The irregular breathing and weak cry suggest inadequate ventilation. The Apgar score is likely low due to these findings. The initial steps of drying, warming, and suctioning have been performed. According to neonatal resuscitation guidelines, if the heart rate is below 100/min, positive pressure ventilation (PPV) should be initiated. Chest compressions are indicated if the heart rate is below 60/min after 30 seconds of effective PPV. Therefore, the best next step is to provide PPV and reassess.",9
6446,"The patient's symptoms and lab findings suggest iron deficiency anemia. She has fatigue, pallor, and a dietary history that could lead to iron deficiency (recently became vegan). The complete blood count shows low hemoglobin and hematocrit, and the peripheral smear shows hypochromic red blood cells, which are typical of iron deficiency anemia. The minor reduction in hemoglobin A2 seen on electrophoresis can occur in iron deficiency anemia as well. In iron deficiency anemia, we would expect to see low serum iron, low ferritin (indicating low iron stores), high total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and low transferrin saturation on iron studies.",9
6464,"The patient's symptoms of greasy stools and unintentional weight loss suggest malabsorption, likely due to chronic pancreatitis given his significant alcohol history. Chronic pancreatitis can lead to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, causing steatorrhea. The next step in diagnosis should focus on assessing the pancreas. A CT abdomen with IV contrast can help visualize pancreatic calcifications, ductal changes, or other structural abnormalities consistent with chronic pancreatitis.",9
6492,"The patient is experiencing urinary retention and overflow incontinence, likely due to bladder atony or urethral obstruction following childbirth with epidural anesthesia and forceps use. The symptoms of urinary leakage and increased lower abdominal pressure suggest that the bladder is full and unable to empty properly. In such cases, the most immediate and appropriate treatment is to relieve the bladder distension by draining the urine. Urethral catheterization is the best option to achieve this, as it will allow the bladder to empty and relieve the patient's symptoms.",9
6486,"The patient presents with symptoms and findings that suggest a syndrome involving multiple endocrine organs. The key findings include a thyroid nodule with elevated calcitonin, hypercalcemia with elevated PTH, and bilateral adrenal lesions. These findings are suggestive of medullary thyroid carcinoma (elevated calcitonin), primary hyperparathyroidism (hypercalcemia and elevated PTH), and pheochromocytomas (adrenal lesions). These are characteristic of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type IIa (MEN IIa), which includes medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and primary hyperparathyroidism. MEN IIb would also include medullary thyroid carcinoma and pheochromocytoma but typically presents with mucosal neuromas and a marfanoid habitus, which are not described here. Familial medullary thyroid cancer (FMTC) involves medullary thyroid carcinoma without the other endocrine tumors. Li-Fraumeni syndrome involves a variety of cancers but does not fit this specific endocrine pattern.",9

6497,"The patient is presenting with fever, chills, uterine tenderness, and foul-smelling lochia three days postpartum, which are classic signs of postpartum endometritis. This condition is an infection of the uterine lining that commonly occurs after cesarean delivery, especially in the presence of risk factors such as abruptio placentae. The laboratory findings show leukocytosis, which supports the diagnosis of an infection. The pelvic ultrasound shows an empty uterus, ruling out retained products of conception, which means dilation and curettage is not necessary. The appropriate management for postpartum endometritis is broad-spectrum antibiotics. The combination of IV clindamycin and gentamicin is effective against the polymicrobial flora typically responsible for this infection. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to start IV clindamycin and gentamicin.",9
6499,"The patient's symptoms and endoscopic findings are consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The erythema and mucosal erosions in the distal esophagus suggest inflammation due to acid reflux. The absence of metaplasia on biopsy indicates that Barrett's esophagus is not present, which would have increased the risk for adenocarcinoma. In GERD, chronic acid exposure can lead to complications such as esophageal strictures due to fibrosis and scarring from repeated injury and healing. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is more associated with smoking and alcohol use but not directly with GERD. Sliding hiatal hernia is a structural abnormality that can contribute to GERD but is not a complication of it. Pyloric stenosis is unrelated to GERD and typically occurs in infants. Therefore, the most likely complication of untreated GERD in this patient is esophageal stricture.",9
6501,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), which is characterized by the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. The history of diarrhea and vomiting, along with the presence of petechiae, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated creatinine, supports this diagnosis. The normal coagulation studies rule out disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The peripheral blood smear would likely show schistocytes, indicative of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. HUS is often associated with infection by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (E. coli), particularly serotype O157:H7, following a diarrheal illness. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause is an E. coli infection.",9
6510,"The patient is experiencing nocturia and has an enlarged, symmetric prostate, which suggests benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The main factor contributing to BPH is the proliferation of stromal and epithelial cells in the prostate, primarily driven by dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Finasteride is a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor that reduces the conversion of testosterone to DHT, addressing the underlying pathogenesis of BPH. Tamsulosin, an alpha-1 blocker, would relieve symptoms by relaxing smooth muscle but does not address the underlying cause. Therefore, the best choice to target the pathogenesis is Finasteride.",9
6506,"The patient is a 13-year-old girl who has developed physical symptoms such as headaches, nausea, and abdominal pain without any identifiable medical cause. These symptoms began after her mother's operation, suggesting a possible psychological component. The key details are that she is the youngest child, has been a diligent student, and her symptoms started after her mother's surgery. She expresses fear about moving to a new grade and leaving her mother, indicating anxiety about separation. Her mother also appears anxious, which may contribute to the patient's feelings. The patient enjoys school when she is there, ruling out truancy, and there is no indication of fear of social situations or open spaces, ruling out social anxiety and agoraphobia. The symptoms and context strongly suggest separation anxiety, particularly given the recent stressor of her mother's surgery.",9
6502,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with a post-dural puncture headache (PDPH), which is a common complication following epidural or spinal anesthesia. The headache is typically positional, worsening when the patient is upright and improving when lying down. This occurs due to a leak of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at the site of dural puncture, leading to decreased CSF pressure. The patient is afebrile and has no signs of infection, making an infection at the injection site unlikely. A blockage of CSF would not cause a positional headache like this. While interventions such as a blood patch can be used to treat PDPH, many cases resolve spontaneously without intervention.",9
6534,"The patient's symptoms and the description of the rash are consistent with scabies, which is caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. The first-line treatment for scabies is permethrin cream. Permethrin works by disrupting the function of the nervous system of the mites. Specifically, it acts by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels, leading to paralysis and death of the mites. Therefore, the mechanism of action of permethrin is best described as blockade of voltage-gated Na+ channels.",9
6522,"The patient is a 65-year-old woman who is generally healthy and up to date with most of her screenings. She had a normal colonoscopy 8 years ago, which is typically recommended every 10 years if normal, so she is not due for another one yet. Her last mammogram was 1 year ago, and mammograms are recommended every 1-2 years for women aged 50-74, so she is not overdue for that either. She had a Pap smear at age 62, and current guidelines recommend that women aged 65 and older who have had adequate prior screening and are not at high risk for cervical cancer can stop screening. Therefore, a Pap smear is not necessary. However, she is 65 years old, which is the age at which a DEXA scan is recommended for osteoporosis screening in women. Given her age and the fact that she has not had a DEXA scan mentioned, the best next step is to perform a DEXA scan.",9
6530,"The patient is experiencing stress urinary incontinence, characterized by involuntary leakage of urine during activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure, such as walking or standing. She has already attempted conservative measures like Kegel exercises and a continence pessary without improvement. Her diabetes is well-controlled, as indicated by her hemoglobin A1c and blood glucose levels, so tighter glycemic control is unlikely to address her urinary symptoms. Biofeedback is typically used for urge incontinence or mixed incontinence, not primarily stress incontinence. Topical vaginal estrogen can be helpful for postmenopausal women with urogenital atrophy, but it is not the primary treatment for stress incontinence. Given the failure of conservative measures, the next step is a more definitive treatment for stress incontinence, which is a urethral sling procedure.",9
6542,"The patient is a 33-year-old man with HIV and a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 176/mm3, which indicates immunosuppression. He presents with symptoms of a nonproductive cough, shortness of breath, and hypoxemia on exertion. The CT scan shows diffuse, bilateral ground-glass opacities. These clinical features are highly suggestive of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), a common opportunistic infection in patients with HIV and low CD4 counts. The microscopic examination of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in PCP typically shows silver-staining, disc-shaped cysts, which are characteristic of Pneumocystis jirovecii.",9
6550,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of acute rheumatic fever, which occurs after an untreated streptococcal pharyngitis. The key features include fever, joint pain, subcutaneous nodules, and a heart murmur indicative of carditis. The immune response in rheumatic fever is due to molecular mimicry, where antibodies against the M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes cross-react with human tissues, leading to inflammation. The M protein is a virulence factor of Group A Streptococcus and is responsible for the autoimmune response seen in rheumatic fever.",9
6567,"In this scenario, the patient is unable to communicate his wishes due to impaired consciousness. The neighbor, who is a close friend, reports that the patient has always expressed a desire to refuse dialysis or life-prolonging measures. However, the neighbor is not a legal surrogate decision-maker. The patient's father, who is estranged, is the closest relative but has not been contacted. In such situations, the physician should attempt to contact the legal next of kin, which is the father, to obtain consent or refusal for dialysis. If the father cannot be reached or if there is uncertainty about the patient's wishes, consulting the ethics committee is appropriate to ensure that the patient's autonomy and best interests are respected. Therefore, the most appropriate action is to try to contact the father for consent, as he is the legal next of kin.",9
6543,"The patient's symptoms are indicative of stress urinary incontinence, which is characterized by involuntary leakage of urine during activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure, such as coughing, sneezing, or lifting heavy objects. This condition is often due to weakness of the pelvic floor muscles or urethral sphincter incompetence. The Q-tip test is a simple office procedure used to assess urethral hypermobility, which is a common cause of stress urinary incontinence. During the test, a Q-tip is inserted into the urethra, and the angle of deflection is measured when the patient performs a Valsalva maneuver or coughs. A significant change in angle suggests urethral hypermobility. Therefore, the Q-tip test would most likely identify the patient's diagnosis of stress urinary incontinence.",9
6586,"The clinical presentation of the 9-month-old girl suggests a glycogen storage disease. The key features include poor feeding, irritability, hypotonia, muscle wasting, hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia (serum glucose of 61 mg/dL), and elevated urine ketones. The normal lactic acid level helps narrow down the possibilities.

The elevated ketones and hypoglycemia suggest an issue with glycogen metabolism, as the body is relying on fat metabolism for energy. The normal lactic acid level rules out conditions like von Gierke's disease (type I glycogen storage disease), which is characterized by lactic acidosis due to glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency.

Pompe disease (type II glycogen storage disease) is caused by a deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase, but it typically presents with cardiomyopathy and does not usually cause hypoglycemia or elevated ketones.

Gaucher disease involves glucocerebrosidase deficiency and presents with hepatosplenomegaly and bone issues, not hypoglycemia or ketonuria.

The symptoms and lab findings are consistent with Cori disease (type III glycogen storage disease), which is due to a deficiency in the glycogen debrancher enzyme. This condition can cause hepatomegaly, muscle weakness, hypoglycemia, and elevated ketones without lactic acidosis, matching the patient's presentation.",9
6587,"The patient's presentation is consistent with the effects of MDMA (Ecstasy). The key features include hyperthermia (elevated temperature), tachycardia, confusion, agitation, and hyponatremia (low sodium level). The setting of a dance club and the symptoms of euphoria followed by confusion and agitation are typical of MDMA use. The dilated pupils and bruxism (teeth grinding) are also characteristic of MDMA. Cocaine can cause similar symptoms but is less associated with hyponatremia. Diphenhydramine would cause anticholinergic symptoms, including dry skin and mucous membranes, which are not present here. Codeine, an opioid, would typically cause miosis (constricted pupils) and respiratory depression, which are not observed in this case.",9
6590,"The patient's history of smoking and symptoms suggest a possible case of emphysema, where elastase activity leads to the breakdown of elastin in the alveolar walls. The question mentions an isoform of elastase inhibited by TIMPs, which points to metalloproteinases secreted by macrophages. Macrophages are known to secrete metalloproteinases and are also responsible for phagocytosis of foreign material. Therefore, the cell responsible for secreting this elastase is likely a macrophage, which is also involved in phagocytosis.",9
6583,"The patient is experiencing preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) at 31 weeks' gestation. Management of PPROM includes administration of corticosteroids like dexamethasone to enhance fetal lung maturity and tocolytics like terbutaline to delay labor. Additionally, magnesium sulfate is administered for neuroprotection of the fetus if delivery is anticipated before 32 weeks. Azithromycin is used for infection prophylaxis, but the immediate concern here is neuroprotection due to the gestational age. Therefore, the next step after administering dexamethasone and terbutaline is to administer magnesium sulfate for fetal neuroprotection.",9
6591,"The infant presents with cyanosis, respiratory distress, and a holosystolic murmur, along with echocardiographic findings of defects in the interatrial and interventricular septae and an imperforate muscular septum between the right atrium and right ventricle. These findings are suggestive of tricuspid atresia, a congenital heart defect characterized by the absence of a direct connection between the right atrium and right ventricle. In tricuspid atresia, blood flow to the lungs is dependent on a ventricular septal defect (VSD) or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), and the left ventricle often becomes hypertrophied due to increased workload. This condition typically results in left-axis deviation on an electrocardiogram (ECG) due to the underdevelopment of the right ventricle and hypertrophy of the left ventricle. Therefore, the most likely finding on further evaluation is left-axis deviation on ECG.",9
6598,"The patient's symptoms and the barium swallow findings are suggestive of a Zenker's diverticulum. This condition is characterized by an outpouching that occurs above the upper esophageal sphincter. The symptoms of difficulty initiating swallowing, bad breath, and regurgitation of undigested food are classic for this condition. The barium swallow shows a collection of contrast material in the cervical region, indicating an outpouching. Zenker's diverticulum is a false diverticulum, meaning it involves only the mucosa and submucosa herniating through a defect in the muscular layer. This defect is due to increased pressure above the upper esophageal sphincter, leading to the formation of the diverticulum. Therefore, the best description of the lesion is an increased pressure above the upper esophageal sphincter resulting in a defect in the wall.",9
6608,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), including morning stiffness, joint swelling, positive anti-citrullinated protein antibody, and erosive changes on imaging. In RA, the synovial fluid analysis typically shows an inflammatory pattern. Ragocytes, or rheumatoid cells, are neutrophils containing phagocytized immune complexes and are associated with RA. Monosodium urate crystals are found in gout, and calcium pyrophosphate crystals are found in pseudogout. A high lymphocyte count is more typical of viral infections. Therefore, the synovial fluid in RA is likely to show ragocytes.",9
6609,"The patient presents with fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and a diffuse rash involving the palms and soles, following nasal surgery with nasal packing. These symptoms are suggestive of Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS), which is often associated with the use of nasal packing. TSS is caused by the release of exotoxins, such as Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin-1 (TSST-1) from Staphylococcus aureus, which leads to polyclonal T-cell activation. This results in the massive release of cytokines, causing the symptoms observed in the patient, including fever, rash, hypotension, and multi-organ involvement (elevated creatinine and liver enzymes).",9
6613,"The patient presents with bilateral smooth masses under the areola, which is suggestive of gynecomastia. Gynecomastia can occur due to an imbalance between estrogen and testosterone. In this case, the patient is a personal trainer, which raises the suspicion of anabolic steroid use. Anabolic steroids can lead to increased estrogen levels due to aromatization, causing gynecomastia. Additionally, anabolic steroid use can lead to testicular atrophy due to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, resulting in decreased endogenous testosterone production. Therefore, testicular atrophy is the most likely additional physical exam finding in this individual.",9
6611,"The patient presents with symptoms that could be consistent with an infection, such as pneumonia, but also has a significantly elevated leukocyte count with a high percentage of neutrophils and bands. This leukocytosis with a left shift could suggest a myeloproliferative disorder, such as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), rather than a simple infection. In CML, the leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) score is typically low, whereas in a leukemoid reaction (which can occur in severe infections like pneumonia), the LAP score is high. Therefore, measuring the LAP score would help distinguish between a leukemoid reaction due to pneumonia and a myeloproliferative disorder like CML.",9
6614,"The patient's symptoms of fatigue, palpitations, nausea, diaphoresis, and improvement with juice suggest episodes of hypoglycemia. The weight gain and improvement with juice further support this. Given the family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma, there is a possibility of an insulinoma or other pancreatic endocrine tumor, which can cause hypoglycemia. The 72-hour fasting test is used to diagnose insulinoma by observing for hypoglycemia during fasting and measuring insulin levels. Other tests like the oral glucose tolerance test, 24-hour urine catecholamine test, and water deprivation test are used for different conditions such as diabetes, pheochromocytoma, and diabetes insipidus, respectively. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is the 72-hour fasting test.",9
6603,"Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS I) is an enzyme in the urea cycle, which is responsible for converting ammonia into urea for excretion. CPS I catalyzes the reaction that combines ammonia with bicarbonate to form carbamoyl phosphate. This reaction requires N-acetylglutamate as an essential activator, but N-acetylglutamate is not a substrate. The immediate substrate for the synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate is ammonia, which is derived from amino acid catabolism. However, the question asks for the substrate for the synthesis of the molecule needed for excretion of amino groups, which is urea. In the urea cycle, aspartate provides the second nitrogen that combines with carbamoyl phosphate to eventually form urea. Thus, aspartate is the immediate substrate for the synthesis of urea, the molecule needed for excretion of amino groups.",9
6535,"The symptoms presented suggest that the patient is experiencing acute urinary retention, likely due to a chronic issue such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Acute urinary retention can lead to post-renal acute kidney injury if the obstruction is significant. In post-renal AKI, urine osmolality can vary and is less specific, but often the FENa is variable due to the initial retention of sodium. However, as the condition progresses, there may be impaired concentrating ability and changes in sodium handling. There are no specific casts associated with post-renal causes.

Let's analyze the choices:

A. Consistent with a pre-renal cause (no casts, low FENa) - unlikely in a purely post-renal scenario.
B. In line with acute tubular necrosis (ATN) (low osmolality, high FENa, muddy brown casts) - unlikely in this scenario without ischemia or toxic injury.
C. Indicative of glomerulonephritis (RBC casts) - does not match the clinical picture.
D. Consistent with post-renal obstruction (high FENa, no casts) - fits the clinical picture of urinary retention due to obstruction from BPH.",9
6620,"The patient in this scenario is experiencing refeeding syndrome, a complication that occurs when feeding is restarted in malnourished patients. This syndrome is characterized by electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia, due to the shift of electrolytes into cells as metabolism increases. The patient was started on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) after being malnourished, as indicated by his low BMI and history of alcoholism. The rapid introduction of nutrition, especially carbohydrates, can lead to a sudden increase in insulin, causing these electrolyte shifts. To prevent refeeding syndrome, it is crucial to start nutrition slowly and monitor electrolytes closely, allowing the body to adapt to the increased metabolic demands. Therefore, the slow initiation of TPN would have helped prevent the development of refeeding syndrome in this patient.",9
6625,"The patient's imaging findings suggest pancreas divisum, where the dorsal and ventral pancreatic ducts fail to fuse properly. This condition is due to a disruption in the fusion of the pancreatic buds during embryological development. The dorsal pancreatic duct drains most of the pancreas through the minor papilla, while the ventral duct drains a smaller portion through the major papilla. The spleen's location anterior to the left kidney is an incidental finding and not directly related to the pancreatic duct issue. Therefore, the embryological process disrupted in this case is the fusion of the pancreatic buds.",9
6665,"The patient is showing signs of respiratory distress with shallow breathing, low oxygen saturation despite high-flow oxygen, and paradoxical chest wall movement on the right side. These findings are indicative of a flail chest, which occurs when a segment of the rib cage breaks and becomes detached from the rest of the chest wall. The paradoxical movement and respiratory distress suggest that the patient is unable to adequately ventilate. In such cases, the most appropriate next step is to ensure adequate ventilation and oxygenation. Intubation with positive pressure ventilation can stabilize the chest wall, improve oxygenation, and support the patient's breathing. This intervention is critical in managing the respiratory compromise associated with flail chest.",9
6642,"The patient's presentation is consistent with actinic keratosis, which is a precancerous condition caused by sun exposure. Actinic keratoses are rough, scaly patches that can develop into squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) if left untreated. SCC is characterized histologically by the presence of keratin pearls, which are concentric layers of keratinized cells. The patient's history of working on a farm and the description of the lesions support this diagnosis.",9
6629,"The patient's symptoms of progressive dysphagia (initially with solids, now with liquids), retrosternal chest pain, and unintentional weight loss are concerning for an esophageal malignancy. The esophagogastroduodenoscopy findings of an exophytic mass with ulcerations in the lower third of the esophagus further support this suspicion. 

In the context of esophageal cancer, adenocarcinoma is more common in the lower third of the esophagus, especially in Western countries, and is often associated with Barrett's esophagus and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Squamous cell carcinoma, on the other hand, is more common in the upper and middle thirds of the esophagus and is associated with risk factors such as smoking and alcohol use.

Given the location of the mass in the lower third of the esophagus and the patient's symptoms, adenocarcinoma is the most likely diagnosis.",9
6667,"The patient's presentation is consistent with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The key features include the presence of bilateral flank masses, hypertension, hematuria, and the imaging findings of enlarged kidneys with multiple cysts. ADPKD typically presents in adulthood, which aligns with the patient's age of 34 years. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) usually presents in infancy or early childhood, not in adulthood. Medullary cystic disease and acquired cystic kidney disease have different clinical presentations and are less likely given the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is ADPKD.",9
6647,"The patient is experiencing hypotension during hemodialysis, which is a common complication. The hypotension is likely due to excessive fluid removal (ultrafiltration) during dialysis. The patient is tachycardic, which suggests a compensatory response to the low blood pressure. The most immediate and appropriate management step is to address the fluid status. Stopping ultrafiltration will prevent further fluid removal, and decreasing the blood flow into the machine will help stabilize the patient's hemodynamics. Infusing saline can also help by expanding the intravascular volume, but the first step should be to stop the process causing the hypotension. Administering calcium gluconate is used for hyperkalemia or hypocalcemia, which is not indicated here. Transfusing packed red blood cells is not appropriate as there is no indication of acute blood loss or anemia causing the hypotension.",9
4637,"The clinical presentation of this 6-month-old girl includes recurring skin infections, delayed umbilical cord separation, and recurrent otitis media. These symptoms are suggestive of a leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD). The key feature here is the delayed separation of the umbilical cord, which is a classic sign of LAD type 1. This condition is caused by the absence of the CD18 molecule on the surface of leukocytes, which is necessary for leukocyte adhesion and migration to sites of infection. The absence of CD18 leads to impaired neutrophil chemotaxis and recurrent bacterial infections, particularly affecting the skin and mucous membranes.",9
6687,"The patient is experiencing symptoms of vaginal dryness and pain during intercourse, which are indicative of estrogen deficiency. She also has a significant decrease in bone density, as evidenced by the drop in her T-score from -1.6 to -2.6. This suggests that the medication she is taking is likely causing a reduction in estrogen levels. 

Palbociclib is a CDK4/6 inhibitor used in breast cancer treatment but does not directly affect estrogen levels.

Paclitaxel is a chemotherapy agent that does not specifically cause estrogen deficiency or bone density loss.

Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that can have estrogenic effects on bone and does not typically cause bone density loss.

Exemestane is an aromatase inhibitor that reduces estrogen production and is known to cause symptoms of estrogen deficiency, such as vaginal dryness and bone density loss. Given the patient's symptoms and the significant drop in bone density, exemestane is the most likely drug exacerbating her symptoms.",9
6693,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with a viral upper respiratory infection, including mild shortness of breath, cough with whitish sputum, runny nose, headaches, and muscle aches. The absence of fever, chills, and significant respiratory distress, along with the negative egophony and lack of rales, suggests that this is not a bacterial pneumonia or a severe respiratory condition. The history of her son having a febrile illness with a rash suggests a viral etiology, possibly a common viral infection like a cold or influenza. The presence of scattered wheezes could be due to bronchospasm from the viral infection. Given these findings, supportive care is the most appropriate management, as the condition is likely self-limiting and does not require antibiotics or further diagnostic testing at this time.",9
6699,"The patient presents with symptoms of continuous urine leakage and incomplete voiding, along with a palpable bladder, suggesting urinary retention. Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, is known to have anticholinergic side effects, including the blockage of muscarinic cholinergic receptors (M-cholinoreceptors). This can lead to urinary retention by reducing bladder contractility, causing overflow incontinence. The other options do not align with the symptoms: β-adrenoreceptor blockage (A) would not cause these symptoms, urethral hypermobility (B) is associated with stress incontinence, and α1-adrenoceptor activation (D) would cause urinary retention but is not relevant here given the medication profile.",9
6698,"The patient is presenting with signs of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), given the timing of symptom onset (3 days post-admission) and the clinical presentation (fever, cough with green sputum, dyspnea, hypoxemia, and left upper-lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray). In cases of HAP, especially in a hospital setting, coverage for multidrug-resistant organisms, including MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is important. 

Option A (Amoxicillin-clavulanate and clarithromycin) is more appropriate for community-acquired pneumonia and lacks coverage for Pseudomonas and MRSA.

Option B (Azithromycin and ceftriaxone) is also typically used for community-acquired pneumonia and does not cover MRSA or Pseudomonas.

Option C (Cefepime and vancomycin) provides broad-spectrum coverage, including MRSA (vancomycin) and Pseudomonas (cefepime), making it suitable for HAP.

Option D (Ertapenem and gentamicin) does not cover MRSA, as ertapenem does not cover Pseudomonas and gentamicin alone is not sufficient for MRSA.

Therefore, the most appropriate choice for empiric treatment of HAP in this scenario is option C.",9
6710,"The patient is presenting with symptoms suggestive of infective endocarditis, likely due to his history of IV drug use. The new systolic murmur at the lower left sternal border suggests possible tricuspid valve involvement, which is common in IV drug users. The most common organisms in this scenario are Staphylococcus aureus, including MRSA. Initial empiric treatment for suspected infective endocarditis in IV drug users typically includes coverage for MRSA and gram-negative organisms. Vancomycin is used to cover MRSA, and ceftriaxone is added to cover gram-negative organisms. Therefore, the appropriate initial management regimen is IV Vancomycin and IV ceftriaxone.",9
6715,"In Study A, the novel MRI technology shows a longer mean survival time in the screened group compared to the control group. This suggests lead time bias, where earlier detection (due to screening) increases the perceived survival time without actually affecting the course of the disease. In Study B, patients receiving the new drug are told to expect quick resolution of their depression, which can lead to the Pygmalion effect. This effect occurs when higher expectations lead to improved performance or outcomes, potentially due to psychological influences.",9
6726,"The patient has a mass in the bladder and multiple osteolytic lesions in the lumbar vertebrae, suggesting metastatic bladder cancer. The biopsy likely shows transitional cell carcinoma, the most common type of bladder cancer in the United States. The strongest risk factor for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder is cigarette smoking. Schistosoma infection is associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder, which is more common in certain regions like the Middle East. Alcohol consumption and nitrosamine ingestion are not as strongly linked to bladder cancer as cigarette smoking.",9
6734,"The patient presents with irregular heavy menstrual bleeding, hirsutism, and slightly enlarged irregular ovaries, which are suggestive of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is associated with chronic anovulation, leading to unopposed estrogen exposure and a lack of progesterone. This hormonal imbalance increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and eventually endometrial cancer due to the continuous stimulation of the endometrium by estrogen without the counteracting effect of progesterone. The patient's BMI of 28 kg/m2 also indicates she is overweight, which can exacerbate the risk of endometrial cancer due to increased peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens in adipose tissue. Therefore, if left untreated, this patient is at an increased risk for endometrial cancer.",9
6741,"In the case of ventricular fibrillation (VF) that is refractory to defibrillation, the next step in the Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) algorithm is to administer adrenaline (epinephrine). Amiodarone is typically given after adrenaline if VF persists. However, this patient has an allergy to amiodarone, so it should not be used. Lidocaine is an alternative antiarrhythmic to amiodarone in such cases. Therefore, the correct combination of medications to administer next is adrenaline and lidocaine.",9
6745,"The patient presents with altered mental status, metabolic acidosis, and an elevated osmolar gap (measured osmolality is 320 mOsm/kg, calculated is 294 mOsm/kg, giving an osmolar gap of 26 mOsm/kg). The presence of oxalate crystals in the urine is a key finding. These crystals are typically associated with ethylene glycol poisoning, as ethylene glycol is metabolized to oxalic acid, which can precipitate as calcium oxalate crystals in the urine. The metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap (due to low bicarbonate) and the presence of renal impairment (elevated creatinine) further support ethylene glycol toxicity. Methanol poisoning would typically present with visual disturbances, and isopropyl alcohol poisoning would not cause metabolic acidosis but rather ketosis without acidosis. Ethanol is less likely given the clinical presentation and lab findings.",9
6762,"The patient's presentation includes several key features that align with a specific personality disorder. She has a history of self-harm, which is often associated with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Her emotional instability, intense fear of abandonment, and tumultuous relationships also point towards BPD. While she does exhibit some attention-seeking behavior, such as wearing a revealing dress, the self-harm and relationship issues are more characteristic of BPD than Histrionic Personality Disorder. Histrionic Personality Disorder typically involves excessive emotionality and attention-seeking without the self-harm and intense fear of abandonment seen in BPD. Avoidant and Dependent Personality Disorders do not fit the presentation as they involve different patterns of behavior, such as social inhibition and excessive need to be taken care of, respectively. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Borderline Personality Disorder.",9
6759,"The patient has a femoral neck fracture and a history of osteoporosis, as indicated by a T-score of -3.0. After acute management, she is likely started on a bisphosphonate, such as alendronate, which is known to induce osteoclast apoptosis. Bisphosphonates are commonly used to treat osteoporosis by inhibiting bone resorption. A known complication of bisphosphonate therapy is osteonecrosis of the jaw, particularly after dental procedures. This is the most closely associated complication with the medication prescribed in this case.",9
6686,"The patient is in hospice care for pancreatic cancer and desires no heroic interventions, which means comfort and pain relief are the main goals of care. Morphine is commonly used for severe pain management in palliative care settings. Combining morphine with a fentanyl patch can be helpful for continuous pain relief, especially in hospice settings where patients are experiencing severe, unmanageable pain. It provides immediate relief with morphine and long-term control with fentanyl. No heroic measures means no invasive interventions, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ketorolac are typically avoided in renal failure due to potential kidney damage. Therefore, the best option is to provide effective pain management with morphine and fentanyl.",9
6764,"The tumor compresses the left anterolateral lower thoracic spinal cord. The anterolateral system, which includes the spinothalamic tract, carries pain and temperature sensations. These fibers cross over to the opposite side of the spinal cord shortly after entering. Therefore, a lesion on the left anterolateral side would affect the right side of the body. Proprioceptive and vibratory sensations are carried by the dorsal columns, which are not affected by this lesion. Thus, pain sensation from the right side of the body would be impaired.",10
6766,"The child presents with symptoms of abdominal pain and epistaxis, and the lab results show a significantly elevated INR of 6.5, indicating a coagulopathy. The normal platelet count and PTT suggest that the issue is with the extrinsic pathway, likely due to a vitamin K deficiency or antagonism. Given the history of potential exposure to poisons under the sink, the most likely cause is ingestion of a rodenticide containing a vitamin K antagonist, such as warfarin or a similar compound. The appropriate treatment for this condition is to replenish vitamin K and correct the coagulopathy with fresh frozen plasma.",9
6768,"The patient's symptoms and chest X-ray findings are suggestive of atypical pneumonia. The culture medium described is specific for organisms that lack a cell wall, such as Mycoplasma species. The presence of colonies resembling fried eggs is characteristic of Mycoplasma pneumoniae. This organism is known to cause atypical pneumonia, especially in young adults, and does not appear on Gram stain due to the lack of a cell wall. The other organisms listed do not match the culture characteristics or clinical presentation as closely as Mycoplasma pneumoniae does.",9
6777,"The patient's symptoms and findings suggest gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with possible Barrett's esophagus. The erythematous appearance of the lower esophagus and the worsening of chest pain with nitroglycerin, which relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter, support this. In Barrett's esophagus, the normal stratified squamous epithelium of the esophagus is replaced by intestinal-type epithelium due to chronic acid exposure. This metaplasia involves the presence of simple columnar epithelium with goblet cells, which is characteristic of intestinal epithelium. Therefore, the biopsy would show simple columnar epithelium.",9
6785,"The clinical presentation and genetic findings are consistent with cystic fibrosis (CF), an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. The most common mutation in CF is the ΔF508 mutation, which leads to defective maturation and early degradation of the CFTR protein. This mutation results in the protein being misfolded and subsequently degraded by the cell's quality control mechanisms, preventing it from reaching the cell surface to function as a chloride channel. The sweat chloride test result of 74 mmol/L supports the diagnosis of CF, as elevated sweat chloride is a hallmark of the disease. Therefore, the mechanism associated with the most common mutation (ΔF508) is defective maturation and early degradation of the protein.",9
6795,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction and suddenly becomes unresponsive with no palpable pulse, indicating cardiac arrest. The ECG likely shows ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, which are shockable rhythms. In such cases, the immediate management is to perform unsynchronized cardioversion, also known as defibrillation, to restore a perfusing rhythm. Synchronized cardioversion is used for patients with a pulse and certain tachyarrhythmias, while epinephrine is administered after defibrillation attempts in the cardiac arrest algorithm. Urgent echocardiography is not appropriate in this emergency situation.",9
6626,"The clinical presentation and echocardiogram findings suggest hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). This condition is characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy, often with preserved ejection fraction and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, which can lead to mitral regurgitation. A family history of sudden cardiac death is also common in HCM. On physical examination, HCM typically presents with a systolic ejection murmur that becomes more prominent with maneuvers that decrease preload, such as the Valsalva maneuver. This is because decreased preload reduces the size of the left ventricular cavity, increasing the obstruction and thus the murmur. Therefore, the murmur does not improve with the Valsalva maneuver, but rather becomes more pronounced. The correct finding would be a systolic ejection murmur that worsens with the Valsalva maneuver, not improves. Thus, the correct answer is not D. Among the options given, none directly describe the worsening of the murmur with Valsalva, but option C, mitral regurgitation, is a common finding associated with the systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve in HCM.",7
6736,,0
6769,"The patient is Mediterranean and recently started treatment for tuberculosis, which likely includes isoniazid. Isoniazid can lead to a deficiency in vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), which is necessary for heme synthesis. A deficiency in vitamin B6 can cause sideroblastic anemia, characterized by fatigue and lightheadedness, due to ineffective erythropoiesis and microcytic anemia. The peripheral blood smear would show ringed sideroblasts, which are erythroblasts with iron-loaded mitochondria. This aligns with option B, drug-induced deficiency in vitamin B6.",9
6806,"The tuberculin skin test (TST) is used to detect latent tuberculosis infection. Sensitivity refers to the test's ability to correctly identify those with the disease, while specificity refers to the test's ability to correctly identify those without the disease. By increasing the cut-off for a positive test from 10 mm to 15 mm, fewer people will be classified as positive. This means that some true positives (those who actually have the infection) will now be classified as negative, leading to a decrease in sensitivity. Specificity, on the other hand, will increase because fewer false positives (those who do not have the infection but test positive) will occur. However, the question asks about the decrease in sensitivity or specificity, so the correct answer is that sensitivity will decrease.",9
6809,"The patient's symptoms and history are indicative of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Key features include a pattern of unstable relationships, impulsivity, recurrent self-harm, feelings of emptiness, and intense emotional swings. The frequent breakups with her boyfriend, self-harming behavior, and mood swings that last a few hours align with BPD. Histrionic personality disorder involves attention-seeking behavior and excessive emotionality, which doesn't fully match this case. Cyclothymic disorder involves chronic mood fluctuations that are less severe than bipolar disorder, but the mood swings described here are more characteristic of BPD. Dependent personality disorder involves a pervasive need to be taken care of, but it doesn't typically involve the self-harm and intense emotional instability seen here.",9
6804,"During muscle contraction, ATP is primarily used in the cross-bridge cycle, where myosin heads bind to actin filaments and then detach after ATP hydrolysis. The A band contains the entire length of the thick filaments (myosin) and overlaps with thin filaments (actin) during contraction. Since the cross-bridge cycle occurs where myosin and actin interact, the greatest activity of radiolabeled ATP would be in the A band, where these interactions are most prevalent.",9
6843,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), which is characterized by painless blisters on sun-exposed areas, such as the hands and face. The history of alcohol use and estrogen-based oral contraceptive use are known triggers for PCT. The family history of a similar rash suggests a possible genetic component, as PCT can have a hereditary form. The switch to day shift may have increased her sun exposure, exacerbating the condition. PCT is associated with increased levels of uroporphyrin in the urine due to a deficiency in the enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase. Therefore, further evaluation is most likely to show increased urinary uroporphyrin.",9
6839,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest asthma, characterized by dyspnea, nocturnal cough, and wheezing. The increased anteroposterior diameter on chest x-ray may indicate hyperinflation, commonly seen in asthma. The history of recurrent ""bronchitis"" episodes in childhood further supports this diagnosis. For long-term management of asthma, inhaled corticosteroids are the most effective treatment to control inflammation and prevent exacerbations. Fluticasone is an inhaled corticosteroid and is appropriate for long-term control of asthma symptoms.",9
6820,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of dementia, including memory loss, difficulty with daily tasks, and disorientation. The Mini-Mental State Examination score of 19/30 indicates cognitive impairment. The normal laboratory tests rule out metabolic causes of dementia. In this context, neuroimaging is important to evaluate for structural causes of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, or other intracranial pathologies. An MRI of the brain is the most appropriate next step as it can provide detailed images of brain structures, helping to identify atrophy patterns, vascular changes, or other abnormalities that could explain the cognitive decline.",9
6850,"The patient's symptoms suggest a condition related to extreme sensitivity to UV light, leading to severe sunburns, freckles, and rough-surfaced growths, along with eye sensitivity. These symptoms are characteristic of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a disorder caused by defects in nucleotide excision repair (NER). NER is responsible for repairing UV-induced damage, such as thymine dimers. The specific step in NER that is often defective in XP involves the recognition of chemically dimerized bases, such as thymine dimers, which are formed due to UV exposure. Therefore, the defect is most likely in the protein responsible for recognizing these dimerized bases.",9
6853,"The patient's symptoms and family history suggest a diagnosis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the degeneration of both upper and lower motor neurons. The symptoms include muscle weakness, atrophy, and fasciculations, as well as spasticity due to upper motor neuron involvement. The presence of both lower motor neuron signs (atrophy, fasciculations) and upper motor neuron signs (spasticity) is typical of ALS. The family history suggests a possible familial form of the disease. In ALS, sensory pathways are typically spared, so paresthesia and sensory loss are not characteristic. A positive Romberg sign indicates sensory ataxia, which is not typical of ALS. Therefore, spastic paralysis due to upper motor neuron involvement is the most likely additional finding.",9
6819,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, which is characterized by facial and arm swelling, distended veins, and jugular venous distension. These symptoms occur due to obstruction of the SVC, often by a mass in the mediastinum. Additionally, the patient has ptosis and miosis, which are indicative of Horner's syndrome, suggesting involvement of the sympathetic chain. This combination of SVC syndrome and Horner's syndrome is classically associated with a Pancoast tumor, which is typically located in the apex of the lung, often affecting the right upper lobe. Given the patient's smoking history and the presentation, a right upper lobe tumor is the most likely site.",9
6851,"The clinical presentation and imaging findings are suggestive of Ewing sarcoma, a malignant bone tumor commonly seen in children and adolescents. The 'onion skin' appearance on X-ray is characteristic of this condition. Ewing sarcoma is associated with a specific chromosomal translocation, t(11;22)(q24;q12), which results in the EWS-FLI1 fusion gene. The presence of lung nodules on the PET scan suggests metastatic disease, which is common in Ewing sarcoma. Therefore, the correct association is the t(11;22) translocation.",10
6864,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of an aortic dissection, given the sudden onset of chest pain radiating to the back, history of hypertension, and smoking. The CT scan likely shows findings consistent with aortic dissection. In such cases, the immediate management involves controlling blood pressure and heart rate to prevent further extension of the dissection. Labetalol, a combined alpha and beta-blocker, is often used to achieve this goal. Heparin and tissue plasminogen activator are contraindicated as they could worsen the dissection. Aspirin is used in myocardial infarction but not in aortic dissection.",9
6871,"The symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a metabolic disorder involving an enzyme deficiency. The key findings are elevated methylmalonic acid and hypoglycemia, which are indicative of methylmalonic acidemia. This condition is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. This enzyme normally converts methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA in the catabolism of certain amino acids and odd-chain fatty acids. The elevated methylmalonic acid indicates that methylmalonyl-CoA is not being converted to succinyl-CoA, leading to its accumulation. Therefore, the product of the reaction catalyzed by the deficient enzyme is succinyl-CoA.",9
6867,"The boy presents with symptoms of a respiratory infection followed by hematuria with blood clots. Adenovirus is known to cause respiratory infections and can also lead to hemorrhagic cystitis, which is characterized by hematuria. BK virus typically affects immunocompromised individuals and is not associated with respiratory symptoms. E. coli infections are more commonly associated with urinary tract infections and hemolytic uremic syndrome, but not with preceding respiratory symptoms. Toxin exposure is less likely given the acute presentation following a respiratory illness. Therefore, the most likely cause is adenovirus infection.",9
6875,"The patient experienced a syncopal episode with brief twitching, which can be mistaken for a seizure. However, the episode was preceded by a prodrome (warm and tingling sensation), was brief, and the patient had no postictal confusion, which are characteristics of vasovagal syncope. Her vital signs and physical exam are normal, and the ECG shows no abnormalities. These findings suggest a benign cause of syncope, likely vasovagal, especially given the context of standing up in a warm environment. There is no indication of a cardiac or neurological cause that would necessitate further immediate investigation such as echocardiography or EEG. Therefore, the best next step is to discharge the patient with reassurance.",9
6889,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest alcoholic ketoacidosis. The key clues are his alcohol use, abdominal pain, nausea, fruity breath (indicative of ketones), and normal glucose level. In alcoholic ketoacidosis, the body metabolizes alcohol, leading to increased NADH levels, which shifts the balance towards ketone production. This results in increased acetyl CoA levels, as the body is in a state of starvation and uses fat for energy, producing ketones. The fruity breath is due to acetone, a type of ketone. The normal glucose level rules out diabetic ketoacidosis, and the absence of neurological symptoms makes thiamine deficiency less likely. The increased osmolal gap is a feature of methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning, not alcoholic ketoacidosis.",9
6894,"The drug in question blocks epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) in the cortical collecting duct. ENaC is responsible for sodium reabsorption in this part of the nephron. When ENaC is blocked, sodium reabsorption is decreased, leading to increased sodium excretion. This also affects potassium secretion because sodium reabsorption via ENaC is coupled with potassium secretion through ROMK channels. Therefore, blocking ENaC would lead to decreased potassium secretion in the collecting tubules. Sodium secretion is not a typical process in the collecting tubules, and urea secretion is not directly affected by ENaC. Sodium chloride reabsorption in the distal tubule is primarily mediated by the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter, not ENaC, so it would not be directly affected by this drug.",9
6912,"The patient presents with a new-onset cough and increased serum potassium after starting a new medication. These symptoms are characteristic of an ACE inhibitor, such as lisinopril. ACE inhibitors can cause a persistent dry cough due to increased bradykinin levels. They can also lead to hyperkalemia by reducing aldosterone secretion, which decreases potassium excretion in the kidneys. The other medications listed do not typically cause both cough and hyperkalemia. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that can cause hypokalemia, not hyperkalemia. Amiodarone can cause pulmonary toxicity but not typically a dry cough and hyperkalemia. Digoxin can cause hyperkalemia in toxicity but does not cause cough. Therefore, the medication most likely responsible for these findings is lisinopril.",9
6896,"The patient presents with a seizure episode and an arterial blood gas showing a low pH (7.21), low bicarbonate (HCO3- of 10 meq/L), and low PCO2 (20 mmHg). This indicates a primary metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation. Given the history of seizures and recent discontinuation of valproate, the most likely cause of the metabolic acidosis is lactic acidosis due to the seizure activity. The patient is not showing signs of severe dehydration or hemodynamic instability, and her oxygenation is adequate. In cases of lactic acidosis, the primary treatment is to address the underlying cause, which is the seizure in this case. Sodium bicarbonate is generally reserved for severe acidosis (pH < 7.1) or when there are specific indications such as severe hyperkalemia or cardiac instability. Therefore, the best next step in management for this patient's acid-base status is observation, as the acidosis is likely to resolve with supportive care and seizure control.",9
4884,"The clinical presentation described in the scenario is consistent with an acute allergic reaction following exposure to peanuts. The symptoms include facial flushing, itching, lip edema, and stridor, which are indicative of anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a severe, immediate allergic reaction that occurs when an individual is exposed to an allergen to which they are sensitized. This type of reaction is mediated by IgE antibodies that trigger the release of histamine and other mediators from mast cells and basophils. This mechanism is characteristic of a Type I hypersensitivity reaction, which is also known as an immediate hypersensitivity reaction. The other types of hypersensitivity reactions (Type II, III, and IV) involve different immune mechanisms and are not consistent with the acute presentation seen in this patient.",9

6946,"The patient's symptoms of lower back pain, tingling, and numbness in the legs, which worsen with standing or walking downhill, suggest neurogenic claudication. This is often associated with lumbar spinal stenosis, where the spinal canal narrows and compresses the nerves. A key feature of lumbar spinal stenosis is that leaning forward (such as when walking uphill or sitting) can relieve the pain because it increases the space in the spinal canal. The other options are less likely: HLA-B27 is associated with ankylosing spondylitis, which doesn't fit the symptom pattern; albuminocytologic dissociation is seen in Guillain-Barré syndrome, which doesn't match the chronic nature of symptoms; and decreased ankle-brachial index suggests peripheral artery disease, which typically causes pain with exertion that is relieved by rest, not by posture changes.",9
4919,"Alendronate is a bisphosphonate used as a first-line treatment for osteoporosis. It works by inhibiting bone resorption, thereby increasing bone density. One of the key administration instructions for alendronate is that the patient must remain upright for at least 30 minutes after taking the medication to prevent esophageal irritation or ulceration. This is crucial for minimizing gastrointestinal side effects. Raloxifene is not typically used as a first-line therapy over bisphosphonates. Hot flashes, flu-like symptoms, and peripheral edema are not common side effects of alendronate but may be associated with other osteoporosis treatments like raloxifene. There is no specific recommendation to stop alendronate after 10 years due to esophageal cancer risk, although long-term use of bisphosphonates is sometimes reassessed due to other potential risks.",9
6954,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with non-allergic rhinitis, characterized by rhinorrhea and nasal congestion triggered by irritants like strong perfumes. The absence of itching, wheezing, or rash, along with no history of allergies, suggests a non-allergic etiology. Intranasal antihistamines, such as azelastine, are effective for non-allergic rhinitis as they help reduce nasal congestion and rhinorrhea. Oral phenylephrine is a decongestant but not the first-line treatment for non-allergic rhinitis. Oral diphenhydramine is an antihistamine but is more effective for allergic symptoms and can cause sedation. Allergy testing is not indicated as the symptoms are non-allergic. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to start treatment with intranasal azelastine.",9
6977,"The clinical presentation is consistent with absence seizures, characterized by brief episodes of staring and unresponsiveness, often with eyelid fluttering. These seizures are typically provoked by hyperventilation and are associated with a classic EEG pattern of 3-Hz spike-and-wave discharges. The first-line treatment for absence seizures is ethosuximide, which is specifically effective for this type of seizure. Other options like carbamazepine and phenytoin are not effective for absence seizures and can sometimes worsen them. Levetiracetam is not the first-line treatment for absence seizures.",10
6941,"The patient recently quit smoking and is experiencing cravings, which indicates she is actively working on maintaining her decision to quit. The stages of change model includes precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. Since she has already quit smoking, she has moved past the contemplation and preparation stages. The action stage involves making specific changes to behavior, which she has done by quitting smoking. The maintenance stage involves sustaining the change over time and dealing with cravings, which is where she currently is. Therefore, the best description of her stage is maintenance.",9
6984,"This 12-day-old neonate presents with jaundice, which is common in newborns. The indirect bilirubin level has increased from 4 mg/dL at 48 hours to 10 mg/dL at 12 days. This suggests physiological jaundice, which is common and usually benign. The total bilirubin level is 11 mg/dL, which is not excessively high for this age. The baby is feeding well, and there are no signs of dehydration or hemolysis. Given these factors, the jaundice is likely due to breastfeeding, known as breast milk jaundice, which is typically benign and resolves on its own. The best course of action is to reassure the mother and advise her to continue breastfeeding, as the jaundice will likely remit without intervention.",9
6987,"The patient presents with sudden onset of severe right leg pain, tingling, and weakness, which are classic signs of acute limb ischemia. The absence of pulses in the right leg, along with pallor and coldness, further supports this diagnosis. His history of smoking, diabetes, and hypertension are risk factors for vascular disease. The irregular pulse suggests atrial fibrillation, which can lead to embolic events causing acute limb ischemia. Leriche syndrome involves chronic aortoiliac occlusion and presents with claudication, not acute symptoms. Buerger's disease is a thromboangiitis obliterans affecting small and medium-sized vessels, typically in younger smokers, and presents with chronic symptoms. CREST syndrome is a form of scleroderma with different systemic manifestations. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is acute limb ischemia.",9
7016,"The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia with significantly elevated triglycerides (600 mg/dL) and LDL cholesterol (166.3 mg/dL). He is already on atorvastatin, which is a statin used to lower LDL cholesterol. However, his triglycerides remain very high, which increases the risk of pancreatitis and cardiovascular disease. Fenofibrate is a medication that specifically targets high triglyceride levels and can be used in combination with statins to manage mixed dyslipidemia. Adding fenofibrate would help reduce the triglyceride levels and lower the risk of further episodes of pancreatitis. Simvastatin is another statin and would not be appropriate as he is already on atorvastatin. Metformin is used for diabetes management and is not indicated here as the patient's glucose level is normal. Aprotinin is not relevant to lipid management. Therefore, the best modification to his therapy is to add fenofibrate.",9
7013,"The 12-year-old boy presents with increased frequency of urination, nocturia, and weight loss. The urine studies show glucosuria (glucose 1+), which is not normal. The serum electrolytes, creatinine, and osmolality are normal, ruling out renal dysfunction. The urine osmolality is high, indicating the kidneys are concentrating urine appropriately. The presence of glucose in the urine without ketones suggests hyperglycemia. These symptoms and findings are consistent with diabetes mellitus, specifically type 1 diabetes, which is characterized by insulin deficiency. Insulin resistance (A) is more typical of type 2 diabetes, which is less common in children and usually associated with obesity. Elevated thyroxine levels (B) would cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism, not glucosuria. A urinary tract infection (C) would typically present with positive leukocyte esterase and possibly nitrites, not glucosuria. Therefore, the most likely cause of these findings is insulin deficiency (D).",9
7002,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a diagnosis of Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA), formerly known as Wegener's Granulomatosis. The key features supporting this diagnosis include:

1. **Respiratory Symptoms:** The patient has a productive cough with hemoptysis, pleuritic chest pain, and nasal ulcerations with septal perforation, which are indicative of upper and lower respiratory tract involvement.

2. **Renal Involvement:** The presence of hematuria, proteinuria, and RBC casts in the urine suggests glomerulonephritis, which is common in GPA.

3. **Skin Lesions:** The palpable nonblanching skin lesions are consistent with vasculitis.

4. **Chest X-ray Findings:** The cavitating nodular lesions are characteristic of GPA.

5. **Laboratory Findings:** The elevated creatinine level indicates renal impairment.

GPA is associated with the presence of c-ANCA (cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies), which are directed against proteinase 3. Therefore, the most likely additional finding in this patient would be increased c-ANCA titers.",10

7030,"The patient is experiencing amenorrhea following a dilation and curettage (D&C) procedure. She has a negative pregnancy test and is using contraception, making pregnancy unlikely. Extreme weight loss can cause amenorrhea, but her weight loss is only 10 pounds and intentional, which is not typically enough to cause amenorrhea. Premature menopause is less likely given her age and lack of other symptoms. Intrauterine adhesions, or Asherman's syndrome, can occur after D&C and lead to amenorrhea due to scarring of the uterine lining, which fits her history and presentation.",9
7060,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of mitral valve prolapse (MVP). The key features include a midsystolic click followed by a late-systolic murmur, which changes with maneuvers such as standing and squatting. These maneuvers affect venous return and ventricular volume, influencing the timing and intensity of the click and murmur. In MVP, standing decreases venous return, causing the click and murmur to occur earlier and become more intense, while squatting increases venous return, causing them to occur later and become softer. Echocardiography in MVP typically shows prolapse of one or both mitral valve leaflets into the left atrium during systole.",9
7067,"The clinical presentation suggests increased intracranial pressure, likely due to obstructive hydrocephalus. The key neurological finding is the difficulty looking up, known as Parinaud's syndrome, which is associated with lesions in the dorsal midbrain. This is often caused by a pinealoma, a tumor of the pineal gland, which can compress the tectal plate and lead to vertical gaze palsy. The history of bacterial meningitis is less relevant to the current symptoms. The MRI would likely show a mass in the region of the pineal gland, consistent with a pinealoma.",9
7072,"In this trial, the null hypothesis is that both medications are equivalent in their blood-pressure-lowering abilities. The study found a p-value < 0.01, which is less than the significance level of 0.05. This means the result is statistically significant, allowing us to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, we cannot accept the null hypothesis, and instead, we reject it in favor of the alternative hypothesis that Medication 1 is more efficacious than Medication 2. Option A is incorrect because the trial did reach statistical significance. Option B is incorrect because the p-value does not represent the probability that medication 2 is superior. Option D is incorrect because we do not accept the null hypothesis when the result is statistically significant. Thus, the correct statement is that we can fail to accept the null hypothesis.",9
7091,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with Sheehan's syndrome, which is postpartum pituitary gland failure due to significant blood loss and hypovolemic shock during or after childbirth. The key features in this case include severe peripartum bleeding, hemodynamic instability, and subsequent symptoms of pituitary failure such as hypoglycemia and poor lactation. The generalized seizure and unconsciousness could be related to severe hypoglycemia or other metabolic disturbances due to pituitary failure. The most likely underlying cause of these symptoms is pituitary ischemia due to the significant blood loss and shock, leading to necrosis of the pituitary gland.",9
7089,"In this scenario, the physician needs to communicate sensitive information to the patient's wife. The most appropriate approach is to first assess her understanding of the situation, which allows the physician to tailor the conversation based on her current knowledge and emotional state. This approach is empathetic and patient-centered, facilitating a more supportive and informative discussion. Option A, ""What is your understanding of your husband's current condition?"" is the best choice as it opens the dialogue and respects the wife's perspective, allowing the physician to address any misconceptions and provide information at a pace she can handle.",9
7088,"The patient is experiencing acute dystonia, a common extrapyramidal side effect of antipsychotic medications like haloperidol. Acute dystonia is characterized by muscle spasms, stiffness, and abnormal postures, often affecting the neck and eyes, as seen in this patient. The most appropriate treatment for acute dystonia is an anticholinergic medication, such as benztropine, which helps alleviate the muscle spasms and stiffness by counteracting the imbalance between dopamine and acetylcholine in the central nervous system caused by the antipsychotic medication.",9
7082,"The patient presents with symptoms of progressive dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea, which are indicative of heart failure. The presence of crackles in the lungs, lower extremity edema, and an enlarged liver suggest fluid overload, commonly seen in heart failure. The EKG shows left ventricular enlargement and a first degree AV block, which can be associated with cardiac remodeling. The cardiac catheterization report from 5 years ago showed a moderately enlarged heart but patent coronary arteries, ruling out significant ischemic heart disease as a cause. The patient's history of alcohol use and previous hospitalizations for ""the shakes"" suggest alcohol use disorder, which can lead to toxic cardiomyopathy. The hyponatremia (sodium of 130 mEq/L) is also consistent with heart failure due to fluid retention. Given these findings, toxic cardiomyopathy due to chronic alcohol use is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms.",9
7109,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of lithium toxicity, including altered mental status, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tremor, and muscle weakness. Lithium toxicity can occur due to dehydration, which is suggested by the patient's dry mucous membranes and recent history of vomiting and diarrhea. The presence of neurological symptoms such as confusion, dysarthria, and coarse tremor indicates significant toxicity. In cases of severe lithium toxicity, especially with neurological involvement, hemodialysis is the treatment of choice to rapidly remove lithium from the body. Other options like bowel irrigation are not appropriate here as they are used for recent ingestion of certain substances, and intravenous diazepam or dantrolene are not indicated for lithium toxicity.",9
7093,"The patient presents with hypertension, hypokalemia (K+ of 3.1 mEq/L), and metabolic alkalosis (serum pH of 7.51). These findings are characteristic of primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn’s syndrome), where there is excessive production of aldosterone leading to sodium retention, potassium excretion, and hydrogen ion excretion, resulting in hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. Pheochromocytoma typically presents with episodic hypertension, headaches, and palpitations, but not hypokalemia or metabolic alkalosis. Cushing’s syndrome can cause hypertension and hypokalemia, but metabolic alkalosis is less common, and other features like weight gain and glucose intolerance are usually present. Addison’s disease typically presents with hypotension and hyperkalemia, not hypertension and hypokalemia.",9
7123,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a macrocytic anemia, as indicated by the elevated MCV of 99 fL. The presence of anti-intrinsic factor antibodies is highly suggestive of pernicious anemia, which is an autoimmune condition leading to vitamin B12 deficiency due to the lack of intrinsic factor necessary for B12 absorption. The neurological symptoms, such as ataxic gait and behavioral changes, along with the hematological findings (macrocytic anemia, low reticulocyte count, and pancytopenia), align with vitamin B12 deficiency. The fact that the patient is a vegetarian further supports the likelihood of B12 deficiency, as B12 is primarily found in animal products. Folate deficiency can also cause macrocytic anemia but does not typically cause neurological symptoms. Hypothyroidism and alcoholism can cause macrocytic anemia but are less consistent with the specific findings and positive antibody test in this case.",9
7110,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of infective endocarditis, given the symptoms of fever, night sweats, weight loss, and the presence of a holosystolic murmur. The presence of petechial conjunctival hemorrhages and macular lesions (Janeway lesions) further supports this diagnosis. The history of a urinary bladder polyp removal could have introduced bacteria into the bloodstream, leading to endocarditis. 

The most common organism causing subacute infective endocarditis, especially in patients with a history of dental procedures or minor mucosal trauma, is Streptococcus viridans. However, given the history of a genitourinary procedure (bladder polyp removal), Enterococcus faecalis is more likely, as it is commonly associated with endocarditis following genitourinary or gastrointestinal procedures.",9
7117,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest aortic valve regurgitation. The key features include:

1. **Decreased exercise tolerance and shortness of breath**: These symptoms are consistent with heart failure, which can occur due to volume overload from aortic regurgitation.

2. **Shortness of breath when lying down (orthopnea)**: This is a common symptom of left-sided heart failure.

3. **Blood pressure of 155/53 mm Hg**: This wide pulse pressure is characteristic of aortic regurgitation due to the rapid drop in diastolic pressure.

4. **High-pitched, decrescendo murmur immediately after S2**: This is the classic description of the diastolic murmur of aortic regurgitation, best heard along the left sternal border.

5. **S3 gallop**: Indicates increased volume load on the left ventricle, often seen in aortic regurgitation.

6. **Strong carotid pulses**: Also known as bounding pulses, are associated with aortic regurgitation due to increased stroke volume.

These findings align most closely with aortic valve regurgitation.",10
7140,"During the second stage of labor, it is common to observe changes in the fetal heart rate due to various physiological factors. The fetal heart rate deceleration noted during pushing is likely due to increased pressure on the fetus. At -1 station, the fetal head is descending into the pelvis, which can lead to compression of the fetal head. This compression stimulates the vagus nerve, causing a reflexive decrease in heart rate, known as early decelerations. These are typically benign and occur with contractions or pushing. Placental insufficiency and umbilical cord compression usually cause late or variable decelerations, respectively, which are not described in this scenario. Fetal myocardial depression is not a common cause of decelerations during labor.",9
7135,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), characterized by ascending weakness, areflexia, and a history of a preceding viral illness. The key features include lower limb weakness progressing to paralysis, decreased sensation in a stocking distribution, and absent reflexes. GBS is a demyelinating polyneuropathy, and the most definitive test to confirm this diagnosis is nerve conduction studies, which would show demyelination and slowed conduction velocities. Serum creatine kinase is used for muscle damage, MRI of the spine is for structural issues, and muscle biopsy is not typically used for diagnosing GBS.",9
7151,"The study described involves identifying patients with and without osteoporosis and then following them over a 10-year period to see if they develop distal radius fractures. This approach involves starting with a group of individuals based on their exposure status (osteoporosis or not) and then observing the outcomes (distal radius fractures) over time. This is characteristic of a cohort study, where participants are followed over time to assess the incidence of an outcome based on their exposure status. The matching on age, sex, and body mass index is done to control for confounding variables, which is a common practice in cohort studies to ensure that the groups are comparable.",9
7152,"The patient presents with microcytic anemia (MCV 79 fL) and increased MCHC (38%), which is suggestive of hereditary spherocytosis. The reticulocyte index is elevated at 3.6%, indicating increased red blood cell turnover. The peripheral blood smear shows red blood cells lacking central pallor, consistent with spherocytes. Hereditary spherocytosis is characterized by hemolytic anemia, and one of the common complications is the formation of bilirubin gallstones due to increased breakdown of red blood cells. Therefore, the patient is most likely to develop gallstones.",9
7161,"The patient presents with muscle weakness, cramps, polyuria, and polydipsia. Laboratory findings show hypokalemia (low potassium), hypomagnesemia (low magnesium), and metabolic alkalosis (high pH with low bicarbonate, indicating a compensatory respiratory alkalosis). These findings suggest a renal tubular disorder affecting electrolyte reabsorption.

Gitelman’s syndrome is characterized by hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hypocalciuria. It is a defect in the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule, leading to these electrolyte imbalances.

Bartter syndrome also presents with hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, but it typically involves hypercalciuria and normal magnesium levels, as it affects the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle.

Liddle syndrome involves hypertension and hypokalemia due to increased activity of the epithelial sodium channel, but it does not typically cause hypomagnesemia or metabolic alkalosis.

Conn’s syndrome (primary hyperaldosteronism) causes hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis, but not hypomagnesemia.

Given the combination of hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and metabolic alkalosis, Gitelman’s syndrome is the most likely diagnosis.",9
7167,"To calculate alveolar ventilation, we use the formula: \( \text{Alveolar Ventilation} = (\text{Tidal Volume} - \text{Dead Space}) \times \text{Respiratory Rate} \). The tidal volume is 650 mL, and the dead space is 150 mL. Therefore, the effective alveolar tidal volume is \( 650 \text{ mL} - 150 \text{ mL} = 500 \text{ mL} \). The respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute. Thus, the alveolar ventilation is \( 500 \text{ mL} \times 15 = 7500 \text{ mL/min} \) or 7.5 L/min.",10
7164,"Patients with HIV infection and a low CD4+ T cell count, such as this patient with a count of 68 cells/µL, are at increased risk for certain opportunistic infections and malignancies. Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is associated with several malignancies, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which is more common in patients with HIV due to their immunocompromised state. EBV can cause B-cell proliferation, leading to lymphomas, particularly in the context of immunosuppression. Other options listed, such as Pneumocystis jiroveci, HHV-6, and Helicobacter pylori, are not directly associated with the increased risk of malignancy in HIV patients.",9

7197,"The patient experienced a sudden onset of left arm weakness and numbness, followed by a generalized tonic-clonic seizure and loss of consciousness. He has a history of cocaine use, which is known to cause vasospasm of cerebral vessels. Cocaine can lead to transient ischemic attacks or strokes due to vasoconstriction. The left facial droop and weakness in the left arm suggest a right-sided cerebral event, likely due to vasospasm. The slurred speech and elevated blood pressure further support the possibility of a cerebrovascular event. Given the acute presentation and the history of cocaine use, vasospasm of cerebral vessels is the most likely underlying mechanism.",9
7187,"The patient is a 55-year-old man with knee pain that has been worsening over the past year. The pain is not significantly altered by a recent bump, and there is no pain upon palpation or with passive range of motion, suggesting that the pain is not due to acute injury or inflammation. The patient has a mildly antalgic gait, indicating some discomfort while walking. His medications and history suggest he has diabetes and hypertension, and he is struggling with alcohol use. The knee is mildly erythematous with bruising, but this could be due to the recent bump rather than an inflammatory process like gout or infection. Given the chronic nature of the pain and the patient's risk factors, osteoarthritis is a likely diagnosis. Weight loss can help reduce stress on the knee joint and is a non-invasive, beneficial initial step in managing osteoarthritis, especially in a patient who may be overweight due to diabetes and hypertension. Therefore, the best initial step in management is weight loss.",9
7202,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest contact dermatitis, likely due to exposure to an allergen during the camping trip. The linear pattern of the rash is characteristic of contact dermatitis, often seen with exposure to plants like poison ivy. Contact dermatitis is a type IV hypersensitivity reaction, which involves presensitized T cells reacting to the allergen. The intense itching and vesicular rash further support this diagnosis. Other options, such as IgG antibodies against hemidesmosomes, preformed IgE antibodies, and immune complex formation, are associated with different conditions like bullous pemphigoid, immediate hypersensitivity reactions, and type III hypersensitivity reactions, respectively.",9
7204,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, including burning pain in the feet, loss of sensation, and a non-healing ulcer. The pain is neuropathic in nature, which is common in diabetic patients. The management of neuropathic pain typically involves medications such as gabapentin or pregabalin, which are specifically used to treat this type of pain. While the ulcer and blood sugar control are important, the question specifically asks about the management of the patient's pain. Therefore, the most appropriate next step to address the neuropathic pain is to start a medication like pregabalin.",9
5159,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest a hematologic malignancy. The key finding is the PCR testing that demonstrates a 9:22 chromosomal translocation, which is characteristic of the Philadelphia chromosome. This translocation is most commonly associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and some cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In children, the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome is more commonly associated with ALL. The appropriate treatment for Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias involves the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib, which specifically target the BCR-ABL fusion protein produced by this translocation.",9
7214,"The husband's behavior is best explained by the defense mechanism of projection. Projection involves attributing one's own unacceptable thoughts, feelings, or impulses to another person. In this scenario, the husband has engaged in extramarital affairs and is likely feeling guilty or anxious about his own infidelity. Instead of acknowledging these feelings, he projects them onto his wife by accusing her of being unfaithful. This allows him to avoid confronting his own behavior and feelings of guilt.",9
7215,"The patient is a 36-year-old woman with a history of multiple pregnancies and losses, presenting with intense abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding at 9 weeks of pregnancy. The pain is described as stabbing and intermittent, and the bleeding includes clots. The physical exam shows an enlarged, irregular uterus with a partially open os and a flesh-colored bulge, suggesting a possible miscarriage. Her symptoms also include joint pain, rashes, and fatigue, which could indicate an underlying autoimmune condition like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which is associated with antiphospholipid syndrome and recurrent pregnancy loss. However, the question asks for the most likely cause of her current symptoms, which include an irregularly shaped uterus. Leiomyomata uteri (fibroids) can cause an enlarged, irregular uterus and are associated with pain and bleeding during pregnancy. The other options do not fit as well: adenomyosis typically causes heavy menstrual bleeding and pain but not an irregular uterus; chromosomal abnormalities are a common cause of miscarriage but do not explain the uterine findings; polycystic ovarian syndrome is associated with infertility and irregular periods but not an irregular uterus or the described symptoms.",9
7216,"The patient is experiencing a common side effect of rifampin, which is known to cause orange/red discoloration of bodily fluids, including tears and urine. Rifampin is one of the standard drugs used in the treatment of tuberculosis. The mechanism of action of rifampin is the inhibition of bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which prevents RNA synthesis and thereby inhibits bacterial protein synthesis. This aligns with option A.",9

7217,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), given the sudden-onset severe headache described as the worst in her life. The neurological findings include left eye ptosis, mydriasis, and an absent pupillary light response, along with the eye deviating inferolaterally. These symptoms are indicative of a left oculomotor nerve (CN III) palsy. The most common cause of a CN III palsy in the context of a sudden severe headache is a posterior communicating artery (PCom) aneurysm. This is because the PCom is located near the oculomotor nerve, and an aneurysm in this location can compress the nerve, leading to the observed symptoms. Therefore, the structure most likely to be abnormal in this patient is the posterior communicating artery.",9
7227,"The patient is a 76-year-old woman with advanced Alzheimer's disease, significant weight loss, and a history of aspiration pneumonia. She has expressed wishes against life-sustaining measures, and her daughter is concerned about her ability to continue care. The patient's condition suggests a need for supportive care focusing on comfort rather than aggressive interventions. Home hospice care would provide support for both the patient and her daughter, focusing on quality of life and symptom management in a familiar environment. Alternative feeding methods may not align with the patient's previously expressed wishes and could increase the risk of further complications. Inpatient palliative care is more intensive and may not be necessary at this stage. Prescribing oxycodone is not appropriate without a specific indication for pain management.",9
7226,"The patient is diagnosed with major depressive disorder and is suggested to start sertraline, which is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). SSRIs are known to have several potential side effects. Among the options provided, delayed ejaculation is a common sexual side effect associated with SSRIs, including sertraline. Urinary retention is not typically associated with SSRIs; it is more common with medications that have anticholinergic properties. Increased suicidality is a concern, particularly in younger populations (children, adolescents, and young adults), but this patient is 58 years old, which reduces this risk. Priapism is a rare side effect and is more commonly associated with medications like trazodone. Therefore, the most likely adverse effect for this patient starting sertraline is delayed ejaculation.",9
7237,"The patient has a foot ulcer infected with multiple bacteria, including a specific type of gram-negative, anaerobic, non-spore-forming bacilli that are resistant to bile and aminoglycoside antibiotics. These characteristics are typical of the genus Bacteroides, particularly Bacteroides fragilis, which is commonly found in the human colon. Bacteroides species are part of the normal flora of the colon and are known for their resistance to bile and certain antibiotics. The presence of these bacteria in the ulcer suggests a possible fecal contamination or translocation from the gastrointestinal tract, which is common in diabetic foot infections due to poor hygiene or compromised skin barriers.",9
7225,"The patient is experiencing elevated homocysteine levels and decreased folic acid levels, which are side effects associated with folate metabolism interference. The xanthine oxidase inhibitor she is likely on is allopurinol, used to treat gout. However, the side effects described are more characteristic of methotrexate, which inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, leading to decreased folic acid levels and elevated homocysteine levels. Among the options, methotrexate is not listed, but a drug that can cause similar effects is azathioprine. Azathioprine can interfere with purine metabolism and lead to folate deficiency-like effects, although it's more commonly associated with bone marrow suppression. None of the other options (cephalosporins, α-methyldopa, cisplatin) are known to cause folate deficiency or elevated homocysteine levels. Therefore, azathioprine is the most likely to cause similar side effects.",9
7246,"The patient has low urine output post-surgery, with only 5 mL of blue-tinged urine since the operation. The intraoperative urine output was adequate, and she received a significant amount of fluids. The bladder scan shows 250 mL of retained urine, indicating that the bladder is not emptying properly. The presence of blue-tinged urine suggests that the methylene blue dye injected during surgery is still present, indicating that the dye has not been flushed out due to low urine output. The most likely cause of the low urine output is a mechanical issue with the Foley catheter, such as a blockage or kink, rather than a problem with fluid status or kidney function, as her vital signs and lab results are stable. Therefore, the next best step is to check the Foley catheter for any issues.",9
7266,"The question describes a scenario where CD2+ cells, which are T cells, are activated and secrete a factor that promotes the growth and survival of other CD2+ cells. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a cytokine that is primarily produced by activated T cells and is known for its role in promoting the proliferation and survival of T cells. IL-2 acts in an autocrine and paracrine manner to stimulate T cell growth, making it the most likely factor described in this scenario. Other interleukins, such as IL-1, IL-4, and IL-5, have different primary roles and are not specifically known for promoting T cell proliferation in the same way as IL-2.",9
7267,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of constrictive pericarditis, such as jugular venous distention, hepatomegaly, and a paradoxical increase in jugular venous pressure on inspiration (Kussmaul's sign). The chest x-ray shows pericardial thickening and calcifications, which are characteristic of constrictive pericarditis. Given the patient's history of immigration from Indonesia, a country where tuberculosis (TB) is endemic, TB is a likely cause of constrictive pericarditis. The presence of night sweats, weight loss, and patchy infiltrates in the lung further support the possibility of TB. Other options like viral myocarditis, amyloidosis, and asbestos exposure do not align as well with the combination of symptoms, imaging findings, and the patient's background.",9
5221,"The clinical presentation of this 2-year-old boy suggests a primary immunodeficiency. The recurrent infections, including severe respiratory infections, oral thrush, chronic diarrhea, and failure to thrive, are indicative of a significant immune system problem. The physical examination findings, such as facial dysmorphisms, also suggest a congenital syndrome. The combination of recurrent viral, fungal, and bacterial infections, along with the specific facial features, is characteristic of DiGeorge syndrome, which is caused by a defect in the development of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches, leading to thymic hypoplasia or aplasia. This results in a deficiency of T cells, as the thymus is crucial for T cell maturation. Therefore, the most likely deficiency in this patient is T cells.",9
7279,"The patient has hypertension that is difficult to control, hypokalemia, and elevated plasma renin activity. These findings suggest secondary hypertension due to renovascular disease, likely renal artery stenosis. The presence of bilateral carotid bruits supports the possibility of atherosclerosis, which can also affect the renal arteries. Renal artery stenosis can lead to decreased perfusion of the affected kidney, causing it to atrophy. This would result in increased renin production from the affected kidney, explaining the elevated plasma renin activity. Therefore, further evaluation is most likely to show unilateral kidney atrophy due to renal artery stenosis.",9
5233,"The patient has developed acute kidney injury (AKI) postoperatively, as indicated by the increase in serum creatinine and BUN. The low urine output suggests oliguria, which could be due to prerenal, intrinsic renal, or postrenal causes. Given the presence of an indwelling urinary catheter and minimal urine output, a postrenal cause such as catheter obstruction is a possibility. Evaluating the catheter for obstruction is a simple and immediate step that can quickly resolve the issue if it is the cause. This should be done before considering other interventions like fluid bolus or dialysis, which are more appropriate for prerenal or intrinsic causes of AKI.",9
7293,"The patient has hypertension that is not well-controlled despite being on multiple antihypertensive medications. The laboratory findings show elevated plasma aldosterone concentration and low renin concentration, which is indicative of primary hyperaldosteronism. This condition is characterized by the autonomous production of aldosterone, leading to hypertension and suppressed renin levels. The most common cause of primary hyperaldosteronism is an aldosterone-producing adenoma, also known as Conn's syndrome. Other options, such as ectopic ADH secretion, increased activity of the epithelial sodium channel, or mutations affecting the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter, do not fit the specific laboratory findings of high aldosterone and low renin.",9
7298,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of scabies, characterized by an itchy rash with small red papules in the axillae and groin, and thin reddish-brown lines in the interdigital spaces, which are burrows. Her immunosuppressed state due to systemic lupus erythematosus and treatment with prednisone and methotrexate increases her susceptibility to infections like scabies. The most appropriate treatment for scabies is permethrin cream, which is applied topically to eradicate the mites.",9
7291,"The clinical presentation and imaging findings are suggestive of Wilms tumor (nephroblastoma), which is a common renal tumor in children. Wilms tumor is associated with genetic abnormalities on chromosome 11, specifically involving the WT1 gene located at 11p13. This gene plays a crucial role in kidney and gonadal development. The presence of a solitary mass in the kidney with a pseudocapsule and no vascular invasion or nodal involvement aligns with typical presentations of Wilms tumor. Other options, such as chromosome 22, 13, and 1, are associated with different conditions and tumors, such as neurofibromatosis type 2, retinoblastoma, and neuroblastoma, respectively.",9
7299,"The patient's age, the characteristics of the breast mass, and the ultrasound findings are key to determining the diagnosis. She is 23 years old, which makes malignant breast conditions less likely. The mass is described as nontender, mobile, with a rubbery consistency and regular borders, which are classic features of a fibroadenoma. The ultrasound findings of a round, solid, homogeneous mass with well-defined borders and low echogenicity further support this diagnosis. Invasive ductal carcinoma and lobular carcinoma typically present with irregular, poorly defined masses and are less common in young women. Medullary carcinoma, while it can occur in younger women, usually presents with a more aggressive clinical picture. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is fibroadenoma.",9
7307,"The patient has a history of multiple sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the past 6 months, indicating a high-risk sexual behavior. While she is currently on oral contraceptive pills, these do not provide protection against STIs. Given her history, it is important to recommend a contraceptive method that also offers STI protection. Condoms are the only option among the choices that provide both contraception and protection against STIs. An intrauterine device (IUD) does not protect against STIs and may not be ideal given her history. The pull-out method is unreliable for both contraception and STI prevention. Tubal ligation is a permanent method of contraception and does not address STI prevention. Therefore, the most appropriate recommendation is condoms.",9
7311,"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with nephrotic syndrome, characterized by significant proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and edema. The presence of fatty casts in the urine further supports this diagnosis. The most common causes of nephrotic syndrome in adults include focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy, and minimal change disease. Given the patient's obesity and the demographic information, FSGS is a likely cause. In FSGS, light microscopy typically shows segmental sclerosis of some glomeruli, which aligns with the patient's presentation and the biopsy findings expected in this condition.",9
7236,"The patient's symptoms of progressively worsening confusion and forgetfulness, along with a flat affect and impaired short-term memory, suggest a neurodegenerative process. At the age of 74, this could be indicative of Alzheimer's disease or another form of dementia. While we don't have the MRI images to review, we can deduce additional findings based on his presentation and age. 

1. Broad-based gait is often associated with cerebellar dysfunction or, in some cases, normal pressure hydrocephalus, presenting with a classic triad including dementia. 
2. Postural instability is common in Parkinson’s disease, which is characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor, but dementia is usually a later finding.
3. The pill-rolling tremor is a resting tremor frequently seen in Parkinson’s disease, which also does not align directly with the primary findings of confusion and forgetfulness as the leading symptoms.
4. Choreiform movements are associated with Huntington's disease and other basal ganglia disorders, but not typically with the dementia profile described here.

Given the choices and the common presentation of an elderly patient with cognitive decline, a broad-based gait suggests normal pressure hydrocephalus complicating the picture, possibly discovered on MRI.

Therefore, further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show:

A. Broad-based gait",9
7321,"The patient has hyperuricemia with a serum uric acid level of 11.6 mg/dL and a low 24-hour urine uric acid excretion of 245 mg/24 h, which is at the lower end of the normal range. This suggests that the patient is an under-excreter of uric acid. In such cases, a uricosuric agent like probenecid can be beneficial as it increases the renal excretion of uric acid, thereby lowering serum uric acid levels and preventing future gout attacks. Rasburicase is used for rapid reduction of uric acid levels in tumor lysis syndrome, not for chronic gout management. Indomethacin and colchicine are used for acute gout attacks, not for prevention.",9
5178,,0
7329,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of mesenteric ischemia, particularly ischemic colitis. The key points include severe abdominal pain disproportionate to physical findings, history of postprandial abdominal pain, and risk factors such as peripheral arterial disease, diabetes, and smoking. The CT scan shows segmental colitis, which is consistent with ischemic changes in the colon. Atherosclerosis is a common cause of mesenteric ischemia due to reduced blood flow to the intestines. The patient's history and symptoms align with this etiology. Hypokalemia and bacterial infection are less likely given the presentation and negative stool culture. Upper GI bleeding does not match the symptoms or findings.",9
5287,"The patient presents with hyponatremia (Na+ 123 mEq/L), elevated BUN (42 mg/dL), and elevated creatinine (1.9 mg/dL), which suggest renal impairment or dehydration. The history of vomiting and diarrhea over the past 48 hours indicates significant fluid loss, leading to volume depletion. This volume depletion can cause a prerenal acute kidney injury, reflected by the elevated BUN and creatinine levels. The elevated bicarbonate (HCO3- 29 mEq/L) suggests a compensatory metabolic alkalosis, which can occur due to vomiting. The patient's use of ibuprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, can also contribute to renal impairment, especially in the context of volume depletion. Psychogenic polydipsia (option C) would typically present with hyponatremia but not with elevated BUN and creatinine. An aldosterone-secreting mass (option A) would typically cause hypokalemia and hypertension, which are not present here. Intrarenal injury (option B) is less likely given the acute presentation and the context of volume loss. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the laboratory derangements is volume depletion due to vomiting and diarrhea.",9
7343,"The patient's symptoms and context suggest a panic attack. She experienced sudden onset of chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, and a choking sensation after a stressful event. These symptoms are characteristic of a panic attack, especially given the rapid onset and resolution in previous episodes. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia, which can occur during a panic attack, and there are no signs of acute cardiac issues. Her physical exam and history do not suggest a thyroid issue, pulmonary embolism, or cardiac structural problem. Therefore, the most appropriate immediate management is to address the acute anxiety symptoms with a benzodiazepine like clonazepam.",9
5229,,0
7368,"The patient presents with a history of multiple unexplained symptoms, including lower back pain, fatigue, and occasional shortness of breath, with no abnormalities found in extensive testing. This scenario is suggestive of a somatic symptom disorder, where the patient experiences significant distress and impairment due to physical symptoms that cannot be fully explained by a medical condition. The most appropriate approach is to validate the patient's experience and provide supportive care, focusing on managing the symptoms and improving quality of life. Option C suggests assessing the symptoms causing the most distress and scheduling regular follow-ups, which aligns with the management of somatic symptom disorder by providing consistent care and monitoring.",9
5305,"The patient has a history of seizure disorder and is taking valproic acid. Valproic acid is known to be teratogenic, particularly associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects (NTDs) in the fetus. This risk is due to the drug's interference with folate metabolism, which is crucial for neural tube development. While lithium can be associated with cardiac anomalies, the question specifically asks about the most likely condition related to her medication history, which points to valproic acid and its known association with NTDs.",9
7366,"The patient presents with findings suggestive of a chromosomal abnormality, such as Down syndrome (Trisomy 21), given the increased nuchal translucency, decreased PAPP-A, and elevated hCG. To confirm a chromosomal diagnosis, a test that provides a karyotype or genetic analysis is needed. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and amniocentesis are both invasive procedures that can provide fetal karyotyping. CVS is typically performed earlier in pregnancy (10-13 weeks), while amniocentesis is done later (after 15 weeks). Since the patient is at 13 weeks' gestation, CVS is the appropriate choice for confirming the diagnosis at this stage.",9
7396,"In this study, two different diagnostic tests are being compared for Alzheimer’s disease. The key issue here is that the two groups are being assessed using different methods (a blood test versus a PET scan). This can lead to measurement bias, which occurs when there is a systematic difference in the way data is collected or measured between groups. Since the tests are inherently different in their methodology and what they measure, any differences in outcomes could be due to the measurement method rather than true differences in disease presence or severity.",9
5357,"The patient's symptoms are suggestive of stable angina, which occurs due to a mismatch between myocardial oxygen demand and supply, often due to coronary artery disease. During exercise, the heart rate increases, which shortens the duration of diastole. Since coronary perfusion primarily occurs during diastole, a shorter diastolic period reduces the time available for coronary blood flow, contributing to decreased cardiac perfusion. This is particularly significant in the presence of coronary artery stenosis, where the coronary arteries cannot adequately dilate to meet increased oxygen demands. Therefore, the duration of diastole is the factor that most contributes to the decreasing cardiac perfusion in this scenario.",9
7405,"The patient's symptoms include fatigue, diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain, and oral ulcers. The colonoscopy findings show non-caseating granulomas and neutrophilic inflammation of the crypts. These findings are characteristic of Crohn disease, which can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract and often presents with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and oral ulcers. The presence of non-caseating granulomas is a key histological feature that helps differentiate Crohn disease from other conditions. Diverticulitis typically presents with left lower quadrant pain and does not cause granulomas. Tropical sprue is associated with malabsorption and a history of travel to tropical regions, but it does not typically cause granulomas. Celiac disease is characterized by villous atrophy and does not cause granulomas or oral ulcers. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Crohn disease.",9
7406,"The patient presents with signs of liver dysfunction, including jaundice, ascites, and coagulopathy, which are consistent with chronic liver disease due to hepatitis C. The elevated creatinine and low urine output suggest acute kidney injury (AKI). The FeNa < 1% indicates that the kidneys are conserving sodium, which is typical of prerenal azotemia. The lack of improvement with intravenous fluids suggests that the kidney dysfunction is not due to simple volume depletion. In the context of liver disease, this presentation is consistent with hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), a type of kidney failure caused by severe liver dysfunction leading to decreased renal perfusion. The unremarkable kidney ultrasound and absence of abnormalities in urinalysis further support this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely cause of the kidney dysfunction is decreased renal perfusion due to hepatorenal syndrome.",9
5362,"The patient presents with irregular periods, oligomenorrhea, obesity, cystic acne, and acanthosis nigricans. These features are suggestive of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is characterized by hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance. A progesterone withdrawal test can help determine if the endometrium is responsive to progesterone, indicating whether there is sufficient estrogen production and anovulation, which is common in PCOS. This test helps confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating withdrawal bleeding after progesterone administration, indicating that the endometrium is estrogenized but the patient is not ovulating.",9
7415,"In early pregnancy, accurate dating is crucial for appropriate prenatal care. The crown-rump length (CRL) is the most accurate method for dating a pregnancy in the first trimester. It is typically used between 7 and 13 weeks of gestation and provides the most precise estimation of gestational age during this period. Other measurements like biparietal diameter and femur length are used later in pregnancy. Serum beta-hCG levels can indicate pregnancy but are not used for precise dating.",9
7444,"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are indicative of heart failure, likely due to left ventricular dysfunction. The presence of orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, S4 gallop, laterally displaced PMI, rales, hepatojugular reflux, and peripheral edema suggest congestive heart failure. In heart failure, especially with volume overload and increased ventricular wall stress, the heart releases brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) as a compensatory mechanism to promote vasodilation, natriuresis, and diuresis. Therefore, in this patient, we would expect an increased production of BNP as part of the body's response to heart failure.",9
7436,"The patient's symptoms suggest a spinal cord issue. The progressive bilateral lower limb weakness, sensory changes, and urinary retention indicate a possible spinal cord lesion. The increased muscle tone, brisk reflexes, and bilateral upgoing plantar reflexes are signs of an upper motor neuron lesion. The sensory level at the umbilicus corresponds to the T10 dermatome, suggesting a lesion around this level. These findings are consistent with transverse myelitis, which involves inflammation of the spinal cord. This condition can cause the symptoms observed in this patient, including weakness, sensory changes, and autonomic dysfunction such as urinary retention.",9
7422,"The patient presents with chest pressure and shortness of breath, symptoms suggestive of angina. The normal troponin and ECG suggest that he is not currently having a myocardial infarction, which would typically show elevated troponins and ECG changes. Given the history of diabetes and smoking, he is at high risk for coronary artery disease. The symptoms started with exertion and only minimally improved with rest, indicating unstable angina rather than stable angina, which would resolve with rest. Unstable angina is typically caused by a disruption of an atherosclerotic plaque leading to a non-occlusive thrombus. This matches option C, as it describes the pathophysiology of unstable angina, where there is plaque disruption but not complete occlusion, which would cause an acute myocardial infarction.",9
7446,"The CTLA-4 molecule is a protein receptor that functions as an immune checkpoint and downregulates immune responses. It is expressed on T cells and competes with CD28 for binding to B7 molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). While CD28 provides a costimulatory signal necessary for T cell activation, CTLA-4 provides an inhibitory signal. Therefore, CTLA-4 interacts with B7 on APCs, which includes B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86). The monoclonal antibody against CTLA-4, such as ipilimumab, is used to block this interaction, thereby enhancing T cell activation and proliferation, which is beneficial in treating conditions like melanoma.",10
7453,"The clinical presentation of the child, including poor growth, chronic cough, respiratory distress, and greasy, foul-smelling stools, is suggestive of cystic fibrosis. In cystic fibrosis, there is a defect in the CFTR gene leading to thick, viscous secretions. This affects the pancreas by blocking the pancreatic ducts, preventing the release of digestive enzymes into the intestine. As a result, there is malabsorption of fats and proteins, leading to steatorrhea (greasy stools) and failure to thrive. The pathophysiology behind the bowel habits is due to pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, which is characterized by atrophy of the pancreatic tissue due to obstruction and lack of enzyme secretion.",9

7456,"Sensitivity is calculated as the proportion of true positives (correctly identified infected individuals) out of the total number of actual positives (all infected individuals). In this case, there are 1,200 patients known to be infected with the parainfluenza virus. Out of these, 120 tested negative, meaning 1,080 tested positive. Sensitivity = (True Positives / Total Actual Positives) = (1,080 / 1,200) = 0.9 or 90%.",10
7465,"Sensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those with the disease (true positive rate). It is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives. In this study, there are 400 patients with breast cancer (diseased arm), and 330 of them tested positive (true positives). Therefore, the number of false negatives is 400 - 330 = 70. The sensitivity is calculated as 330 / (330 + 70).",10
7478,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with migraine headaches, characterized by unilateral, throbbing pain, nausea, and visual disturbances (aura). The headaches improve with rest in a dark, quiet environment. The CT scan shows no acute abnormalities, ruling out other causes. The most appropriate acute treatment for migraines is a triptan, such as sumatriptan, which is effective in aborting migraine attacks by acting as a serotonin receptor agonist. Acetazolamide is used for conditions like idiopathic intracranial hypertension, high-flow oxygen is used for cluster headaches, and verapamil is a preventive treatment for cluster headaches, not acute migraine relief.",9
7480,"The patient has been diagnosed with atypical depression, which is characterized by mood reactivity and symptoms such as increased sleep, increased appetite, and leaden paralysis. She has been on fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), for 2 months without sufficient improvement. In cases of atypical depression, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) like phenelzine can be effective. However, combining an SSRI like fluoxetine with an MAOI is contraindicated due to the risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. Therefore, adding phenelzine while continuing fluoxetine is contraindicated. Increasing the dose of fluoxetine, switching to another antidepressant like desipramine, or adding bupropion are not contraindicated options.",9
7487,"The patient presents with symptoms and lab findings suggestive of macrocytic anemia, specifically due to folate deficiency. The normal methylmalonic acid level and elevated homocysteine level indicate folate deficiency rather than vitamin B12 deficiency, as vitamin B12 deficiency would elevate both methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels. Methotrexate, used for rheumatoid arthritis, is known to inhibit dihydrofolate reductase, leading to reduced folate levels and potentially causing folate deficiency anemia. Folinic acid (leucovorin) is a form of folate that can bypass the block caused by methotrexate and prevent folate deficiency. Therefore, initiation of folinic acid could have reduced the risk of developing this condition.",9
7384,,0
7493,"The patient's symptoms and recent travel history suggest an infection with Legionella pneumophila, which is known to cause Legionnaires' disease. This condition is characterized by fever, cough, dyspnea, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea. The hyponatremia (low sodium level) is also a common laboratory finding in Legionnaires' disease. The organism is often associated with water sources, such as those found in spas or hot tubs, which aligns with the patient's recent visit to a spa in the Rocky Mountains. 

Legionella pneumophila is a fastidious organism that requires specific growth conditions. The appropriate culture medium for Legionella is charcoal yeast extract agar enriched with iron and cysteine, which supports the growth of this bacterium.

Therefore, the most appropriate growth medium to culture the pathogen responsible for this patient's condition is charcoal yeast agar with iron and cysteine.",9
7495,"The key detail in the question is that the viral genetic material alone is sufficient to initiate viral replication and production of viral polymerase in the host cells. This suggests that the virus has a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome, as these types of viruses can directly serve as mRNA and be translated by the host's ribosomes to produce viral proteins, including polymerase. Among the options, poliovirus, which causes poliomyelitis, is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus. Rotavirus (A) is a double-stranded RNA virus, influenza (B) is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus, and rabies (C) is also a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus. Therefore, the virus in question is most likely to cause poliomyelitis.",9
5427,"The patient has a palpable breast mass with axillary lymphadenopathy and biopsy findings consistent with breast cancer. In breast cancer, several factors can indicate prognosis. ER positive status generally suggests a better prognosis as it means the cancer is likely responsive to hormone therapy. HER-2/neu positivity often indicates a more aggressive cancer and can be associated with a poorer prognosis, although targeted therapies like trastuzumab can improve outcomes. Axillary lymphadenopathy suggests lymph node involvement, which is a strong indicator of a poor prognosis as it indicates potential spread of the cancer. Increased age itself is not a direct indicator of prognosis in breast cancer but may influence treatment decisions and comorbidities. Among the options, axillary lymphadenopathy is the most important indicator of a poor prognosis due to its association with metastatic disease.",9
5447,"The patient's symptoms and clinical findings are suggestive of acute decompensated heart failure, likely due to left-sided heart failure given the presence of pulmonary edema (pink frothy sputum, dyspnea, and fine crepitations). The chest X-ray findings of cardiomegaly and Kerley lines further support this diagnosis. The physician prescribed a drug that reduces preload, which is a key strategy in managing pulmonary congestion in heart failure. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is commonly used to reduce preload by promoting diuresis, thereby decreasing fluid overload and relieving symptoms of pulmonary congestion. The significant improvement in symptoms after 2 days is consistent with the effects of furosemide. Captopril (an ACE inhibitor) and digoxin (a cardiac glycoside) do not primarily act by reducing preload acutely. Tolvaptan, a vasopressin receptor antagonist, is used for hyponatremia and does not directly address preload reduction in acute heart failure.",9
7496,"The patient has a right ovarian mass, and during surgical removal of an ovarian mass, it is crucial to protect the ureter. The ureter runs close to the ovarian vessels, which are ligated during the procedure. The ureter is at risk of injury because it passes near the infundibulopelvic ligament (suspensory ligament of the ovary), which contains the ovarian vessels. Therefore, the ureter must be diligently protected during the surgery to avoid injury.",9
5456,"The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently consuming a large amount of alcohol daily. Chronic alcohol use can lead to cerebellar degeneration, which affects coordination and balance. Dysdiadochokinesia, the inability to perform rapid alternating movements, is a common sign of cerebellar dysfunction. This makes option C the most likely finding in this patient. Constipation (A) is not directly related to alcohol abuse. Decreased CNS NMDA activity (B) is not a typical finding in chronic alcohol use; rather, alcohol acts as an NMDA receptor antagonist, but chronic use can lead to upregulation of these receptors. Microcytic anemia (D) is more commonly associated with iron deficiency or chronic disease, not directly with alcohol abuse.",9
5449,"The clinical scenario describes a child with symptoms suggestive of a mitochondrial disorder, as indicated by the presence of red ragged fibers on muscle biopsy. Mitochondrial disorders are often inherited through mitochondrial DNA, which is passed from mother to offspring. The phenomenon where different offspring of the same mother have varying degrees of symptoms or are unaffected is explained by heteroplasmy. Heteroplasmy refers to the presence of a mixture of normal and mutated mitochondrial DNA within a cell, leading to variable expression of mitochondrial diseases among siblings.",9
5453,"The patient's symptoms suggest a classic presentation of reactive arthritis, which is part of the spondyloarthropathies. The triad of urethritis, conjunctivitis, and arthritis, especially following a genitourinary or gastrointestinal infection, is characteristic. His inconsistent condom use and multiple sexual partners increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections, which can trigger reactive arthritis. The family history of autoimmune disease with a malar rash suggests lupus, but the patient's symptoms align more with reactive arthritis. Chondrocalcinosis is associated with pseudogout, which doesn't fit this presentation. The HLA-B27 genotype is commonly associated with reactive arthritis and other spondyloarthropathies, making it the most likely finding in further evaluation.",9
5455,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a diagnosis of leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, which is caused by Mycobacterium leprae. The key clinical features include skin lesions and peripheral neuropathy, particularly affecting sensation. The patient's outdoor lifestyle and potential exposure to wild animals, such as armadillos, which are known reservoirs of M. leprae, further support this diagnosis. Mycobacterium leprae is an acid-fast bacillus that is intracellular, meaning it resides within host cells. This matches the description in option A.",9
5461,"The patient's presentation is consistent with cluster headaches, characterized by severe unilateral headache, often with autonomic symptoms such as lacrimation, rhinorrhea, and sweating. These headaches occur in clusters over a period of time. The acute management of cluster headaches involves abortive treatments. High-flow oxygen is a first-line treatment, but if the patient does not respond, subcutaneous sumatriptan is the next best step. Verapamil is used for prophylaxis, not acute treatment. CT angiography is not indicated as there is no suspicion of vascular pathology. Deep brain stimulation is not a standard treatment for acute cluster headache.",9
7505,"The patient has chronic kidney disease and anemia, likely due to decreased erythropoietin production. She is treated with erythropoietin, which stimulates red blood cell production. One week after treatment, a peripheral blood smear is examined. The question asks about the prominent color of an intracellular structure after specialized staining.

Increased erythropoiesis leads to the presence of reticulocytes, which are immature red blood cells. Reticulocytes contain residual ribosomal RNA, which can be visualized with special stains such as methylene blue or new methylene blue, resulting in a bluish color. This is known as reticulocyte staining.

The other options:
- Denatured globin chains (Heinz bodies) are not typically seen in this context.
- Remnants of the nucleus (Howell-Jolly bodies) are seen in asplenia or hyposplenism.
- Mitochondria are not typically stained in peripheral blood smears.

Therefore, the prominent color in the reticulocytes is due to ribosomal RNA.",9
7514,"The patient has simple endometrial hyperplasia without atypia, which is a condition characterized by the proliferation of endometrial glands without cellular atypia. This condition is often due to unopposed estrogen stimulation, especially in postmenopausal women who are obese, as adipose tissue can convert androgens to estrogens. The management of simple endometrial hyperplasia without atypia typically involves progestin therapy to counteract the effects of estrogen and reduce the risk of progression to endometrial cancer. Megestrol acetate is a progestin that can be used to treat endometrial hyperplasia without atypia. Anastrozole is an aromatase inhibitor used in breast cancer, estrogen-progestin contraceptives are not typically used in this scenario, and nafarelin is a GnRH agonist used for conditions like endometriosis, not for endometrial hyperplasia.",9
5465,"The infant presents with signs and symptoms suggestive of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), including a continuous murmur and signs of heart failure (sweating during feeds, tachypnea, and increased feeding time). The infant was born at 36 weeks, making him a late preterm infant, which increases the likelihood of PDA. The management of PDA in preterm infants often involves medical closure with indomethacin or ibuprofen. Prostaglandin E1 is used to keep the ductus arteriosus open, which is not needed here. Percutaneous surgery is typically reserved for older children or when medical management fails. Digoxin and furosemide are used to manage heart failure symptoms but do not address the underlying PDA. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to attempt closure of the PDA with indomethacin.",9
5482,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of scarlet fever, which is caused by Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes). The key features include fever, sore throat, and a characteristic rash that is maculopapular and erythematous, with a 'sandpaper' texture, and a 'strawberry tongue.' The rash typically blanches with pressure and may have petechiae in areas like the axilla. The flushed face with circumoral pallor is also characteristic. The leukocytosis with neutrophilia supports a bacterial infection. A known sequela of streptococcal infections, particularly pharyngitis, is postinfectious glomerulonephritis, which can occur after skin or throat infections with certain nephritogenic strains of Group A Streptococcus.",9
7521,"The patient presents with a stab wound to the back at the level of T10, resulting in specific neurological deficits. The key findings include right-sided flaccid paralysis and diminished vibratory sense, along with left-sided loss of pain and temperature sensation. This pattern is characteristic of Brown-Sequard syndrome, which occurs due to hemisection of the spinal cord. In this syndrome, there is ipsilateral loss of motor function and proprioception/vibration sense due to damage to the corticospinal tract and dorsal columns, respectively. There is also contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation due to damage to the spinothalamic tract, which crosses over to the opposite side a few segments above the level of entry. The absence of Babinski sign and the presence of hyperreflexia are consistent with upper motor neuron involvement on the right side. The other options do not match the pattern of deficits observed: Anterior cord syndrome would cause bilateral loss of motor function and pain/temperature sensation, posterior cord syndrome would cause loss of proprioception and vibration sense without motor deficits, and central cord syndrome typically affects the upper extremities more than the lower extremities.",9
7530,"The patient is pregnant and has a Pap smear showing high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL). In pregnancy, the management of HGSIL typically involves performing a colposcopy to evaluate the cervix more closely. If the colposcopy is satisfactory and does not show invasive cancer, further invasive procedures like biopsy or LEEP are usually deferred until after delivery unless there is a suspicion of invasive cancer. Therefore, the best next step is to perform a colposcopy now to assess the cervix.",9

5486,"The patient's symptoms and MRI findings suggest a diagnosis of vascular dementia. The key points in the history include the sudden onset of cognitive decline, mood changes, and the presence of focal neurological deficits such as loss of sensation in the right leg and an unsteady gait. The MRI shows multiple deep white matter lesions, which are indicative of small vessel disease often seen in vascular dementia. The patient's history of hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease further supports this diagnosis, as these are risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. The presence of a positive Romberg test (right arm rotating inward) also suggests a neurological deficit consistent with vascular issues. The gradual progression and specific neurological findings differentiate it from Alzheimer disease and frontotemporal dementia, which typically have different patterns of cognitive and behavioral changes. Vitamin B12 deficiency could cause neurological symptoms but would not typically present with the MRI findings described.",9
7537,"The patient's symptoms and findings are suggestive of psoriatic arthritis. The key features include dactylitis (""sausage digit""), nail pitting, and joint involvement, particularly the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints. The X-ray findings of erosions and periarticular new bone formation are also characteristic of psoriatic arthritis. The history of severe dandruff may indicate underlying psoriasis, which is often associated with psoriatic arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis typically involves the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints rather than the DIP joints and does not usually cause nail pitting. Osteoarthritis can affect the DIP joints but is not associated with dactylitis or nail pitting. Reactive arthritis can cause dactylitis but is not typically associated with nail pitting or the specific X-ray findings described.",9
5494,"The patient presents with white plaques on the tongue that can be scraped off, which is characteristic of oral thrush, commonly caused by Candida species. Candida is a yeast, and one of its key diagnostic features is the ability to form germ tubes when incubated in serum at 37°C for a few hours. This feature is used to differentiate Candida albicans from other Candida species. The patient's use of an inhaler, especially if it is a corticosteroid inhaler, can predispose to oral thrush due to local immunosuppression. Therefore, the characteristic of the most likely cause of this patient's condition is germ tube formation.",9
5495,"The patient presents with signs of cardiac tamponade, which include hypotension, distended neck veins, and distant heart sounds, known as Beck's triad. These symptoms, along with the mechanism of injury (stab wound to the chest), suggest that blood has accumulated in the pericardial space, compressing the heart and impairing its ability to pump effectively. The immediate treatment for cardiac tamponade is pericardiocentesis, which involves the removal of fluid from the pericardial sac to relieve pressure on the heart. This procedure is crucial to restore hemodynamic stability and improve the patient's survival chances.",9
7541,"The patient's presentation is classic for acute gouty arthritis, characterized by sudden onset of severe pain, swelling, and erythema of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. His risk factors include a diet high in red meat, alcohol consumption, and the use of a thiazide diuretic, all of which can increase uric acid levels. Gout is caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joint, which are negatively birefringent under polarized light microscopy. This distinguishes them from calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals, which are positively birefringent and associated with pseudogout.",9
5498,"The patient has clearly expressed a desire not to know the details of his diagnosis and has made a decision about his care preferences. Respecting patient autonomy is a fundamental principle in medical ethics. The physician should honor the patient's wish not to know the details of his condition, as long as the patient is competent to make this decision. Therefore, the most appropriate response is to respect his decision.",9
5515,"The key features in this case include early pubic hair development, multiple fractures, and hyperpigmented macules with rough, serpiginous borders. The early pubic hair and breast development suggest precocious puberty. The history of fractures suggests a bone disorder. The hyperpigmented macules are indicative of café-au-lait spots. McCune-Albright syndrome is characterized by the triad of precocious puberty, café-au-lait spots with irregular borders, and fibrous dysplasia of bone, which can lead to fractures. This aligns with the patient's presentation. Osteogenesis imperfecta typically presents with blue sclerae and does not cause café-au-lait spots or precocious puberty. Neurofibromatosis type I involves café-au-lait spots but is associated with neurofibromas and Lisch nodules, not precocious puberty. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia can cause early pubic hair but does not explain the café-au-lait spots or fractures.",9
5521,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), as indicated by dyspnea on exertion, pitting edema, and an S3 heart sound, with an ejection fraction of 51%. She also has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Her current medication is torsemide, a diuretic, which helps manage fluid overload but does not address the underlying cardiac issues or hypertension effectively.

In managing HFpEF, controlling blood pressure and addressing any potential cardiac remodeling are important. ACE inhibitors (like enalapril) and beta-blockers (like bisoprolol) are beneficial in managing hypertension and providing cardiac protection. Enalapril can help with afterload reduction and potentially improve cardiac function, while bisoprolol can help control heart rate and reduce cardiac workload.

Option B, enalapril and bisoprolol, provides a combination that addresses both hypertension and heart failure symptoms, making it a suitable choice for this patient.",9
7578,"The patient's symptoms are characterized by palpitations, sweating, facial blushing, and nausea, which are triggered by social situations, particularly when she is called to speak in class. These symptoms are consistent with anxiety related to social performance. She avoids situations where she might be embarrassed, such as skipping class on discussion days, indicating a fear of negative evaluation by others. This pattern aligns with social anxiety disorder, where the anxiety is specifically related to social or performance situations. The absence of pervasive anxiety across various domains of life makes generalized anxiety disorder less likely. Schizotypal personality disorder involves odd beliefs and behaviors, which are not present here. Avoidant personality disorder involves a broader pattern of social inhibition and feelings of inadequacy, which is not fully supported by the information provided. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is social anxiety disorder.",9
7579,"The clinical presentation and biopsy findings are suggestive of bullous pemphigoid, an autoimmune blistering disorder. The tense blisters and the negative Nikolsky sign (rubbing does not cause blistering) are characteristic. The biopsy shows subepidermal blistering with eosinophilic infiltrate, and immunofluorescence reveals a linear pattern of immune complex deposits along the basement membrane. This pattern is typical for bullous pemphigoid, where autoantibodies target hemidesmosomes, which are structures that anchor the basal cells of the epidermis to the basement membrane. Therefore, a defect in hemidesmosomes is most likely involved in the formation of these blisters.",9
7585,"The patient presents with right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, tender hepatomegaly, and laboratory findings of elevated liver enzymes and high hemoglobin concentration. The absence of jugular venous distention suggests that right-sided heart failure or constrictive pericarditis is less likely. The elevated hemoglobin concentration could indicate polycythemia, which can be associated with Budd-Chiari syndrome (hepatic vein obstruction). Budd-Chiari syndrome is characterized by hepatic vein obstruction leading to liver congestion, hepatomegaly, abdominal pain, and jaundice. The elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin are consistent with liver dysfunction due to venous outflow obstruction. Increased iron absorption (hemochromatosis) and hepatic steatosis typically do not present with acute abdominal pain and jaundice. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is hepatic vein obstruction.",9
5484,,0
7596,"The patient presents with signs of dehydration (decreased skin turgor, dry mucosa, tachycardia, hypotension) and acute kidney injury (elevated creatinine and urea nitrogen). The presence of brownish granular casts in the urine suggests acute tubular necrosis (ATN), which is often due to ischemic injury to the renal tubules. In ATN, ischemia leads to damage and necrosis of the tubular epithelial cells, resulting in the sloughing off of these cells and the formation of granular casts. A key pathological feature of ischemic ATN is the denudation of the tubular basement membrane due to the loss of epithelial cells. Therefore, the process most likely involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition is the denudation of the tubular basement membrane.",9
7606,"The patient presents with progressive weakness, difficulty combing her hair, and climbing stairs, which suggests proximal muscle weakness. The rash involving the orbits and diffuse erythema of the upper back, posterior neck, and shoulders is characteristic of a heliotrope rash and shawl sign, respectively. These findings are indicative of dermatomyositis, an inflammatory myopathy. In dermatomyositis, the presence of anti-Jo-1 antibodies is common, although not exclusive. The other options are less likely: anti-centromere antibodies are associated with limited scleroderma (CREST syndrome), anti-histone antibodies are associated with drug-induced lupus, and voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies are associated with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, which does not fit the clinical picture here.",9
7603,"The patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest a pancreatic head mass causing obstructive jaundice. The dilation of the biliary and pancreatic ducts, along with the hypoechoic mass, is indicative of a pancreatic tumor, likely pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Among the options, Cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) is a tumor marker that is most specific for pancreatic cancer. Anti-HBc IgM is related to hepatitis B infection, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies are associated with vasculitis, and alpha-fetoprotein is a marker for liver cancer and germ cell tumors. Therefore, the most specific serum finding for pancreatic cancer in this context is an elevation of CA 19-9.",9
5545,"The patient's symptoms and recent travel history are key to identifying the cause of her condition. She presents with fever, muscle and joint pain, nausea, gingival bleeding, and a petechial rash. Her laboratory findings show leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. These symptoms and lab results are consistent with a viral hemorrhagic fever. 

Given her recent travel to Southeast Asia, dengue fever is a strong consideration. Dengue fever is endemic in Southeast Asia and is characterized by high fever, severe muscle and joint pain (often referred to as ""breakbone fever""), rash, and bleeding tendencies due to thrombocytopenia. The mild gingival bleeding and petechial rash are indicative of the hemorrhagic component of dengue.

Ebola virus is less likely as it is not endemic to Southeast Asia and typically presents with more severe hemorrhagic symptoms. Leptospirosis can cause similar symptoms but is more associated with exposure to contaminated water and does not typically cause a petechial rash. Yellow fever is endemic to Africa and South America, not Southeast Asia, and the patient likely received vaccination against it before traveling.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is dengue fever.",9
5559,"The patient's symptoms are indicative of a seizure. He experienced a period of unresponsiveness with a blank stare and lip-smacking behavior, which are characteristic of automatisms seen in complex partial seizures. These seizures originate from a specific area of the brain, often the temporal lobe, and can cause altered consciousness and automatisms. The postictal confusion and amnesia further support this diagnosis. Generalized seizures typically involve loss of consciousness and bilateral motor activity, which were not described here. Malingering is unlikely given the described clinical features and lack of external incentives. A transient ischemic attack would not typically present with automatisms or postictal confusion.",9
5563,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with lung cancer. The key findings include hyponatremia (low sodium) and hypokalemia (low potassium), along with a central lung nodule and a history of heavy smoking. These findings are consistent with small cell lung cancer (SCLC), which is known for causing paraneoplastic syndromes such as SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion) leading to hyponatremia. The histological pattern associated with small cell lung cancer is the presence of Kulchitsky cells with hyperchromatic nuclei.",9
5577,"To detect significant adverse effects in a study, increasing the sample size is crucial. A larger sample size provides more data points, which enhances the ability to identify rare or uncommon adverse effects that might not be apparent in smaller groups. Decreasing post-market surveillance time would reduce the opportunity to observe long-term effects. Non-randomization and increasing selection bias would compromise the study's validity and reliability, making it harder to attribute observed effects directly to the medication rather than other variables.",9
7632,"The patient presents with hyponatremia (serum Na+ 120 mEq/L) and low serum osmolality (260 mOsm/L), which suggests a state of dilutional hyponatremia. The urine osmolality is higher than the serum osmolality, indicating that the kidneys are not appropriately excreting dilute urine, which is consistent with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). The patient's history of chronic cough and significant smoking history raises suspicion for a paraneoplastic syndrome, particularly SIADH secondary to a small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is known to produce ectopic ADH, leading to SIADH. A chromogranin positive mass in the lung would be consistent with SCLC, which is a neuroendocrine tumor that often stains positive for chromogranin.",9
5600,"Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a cytokine primarily involved in the growth and activation of eosinophils. It is produced by Th2 cells and plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of asthma by promoting the recruitment and activation of eosinophils, which are key inflammatory cells in allergic reactions and asthma. The increased concentration of IL-5 in this patient suggests enhanced eosinophilic activity, which is consistent with the patient's asthma exacerbation. Therefore, the most likely effect of increased IL-5 is the recruitment and activation of eosinophils.",9
5567,"The patient presents with symptoms of dysphagia and heartburn, and the barium swallow fluoroscopy indicates a hiatal hernia with herniation of the gastric fundus into the thorax. This is suggestive of a paraesophageal hernia. In such cases, lifestyle modification and pharmacological treatments like antacids or H2 blockers (such as cimetidine) are generally first-line for managing symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, in the case of a paraesophageal hernia, there is a risk of complications such as strangulation, and surgical intervention is often recommended to prevent these risks. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in managing the underlying condition is surgical gastropexy.",9
7642,"The patient has resistant hypertension and a significant increase in serum creatinine, which suggests renal artery stenosis is affecting kidney function. The Doppler and CT findings confirm significant stenosis in the right renal artery. In cases where there is significant renal artery stenosis with worsening renal function, revascularization can be considered to improve blood flow and potentially stabilize kidney function. Maximizing antihypertensive medications might not address the underlying issue of reduced renal perfusion due to the stenosis. Therefore, renal artery revascularization is the most appropriate next step.",9
5606,"The patient is experiencing fatigue, difficulty with breastfeeding, hypotension, and tachycardia following a severe postpartum hemorrhage. These symptoms are suggestive of Sheehan's syndrome, which is caused by pituitary infarction. During severe blood loss, the pituitary gland, which is enlarged during pregnancy, is particularly vulnerable to ischemia. This can lead to necrosis of the pituitary tissue, resulting in hypopituitarism. The symptoms of fatigue and inability to lactate are due to deficiencies in pituitary hormones such as ACTH and prolactin. The hypotension and tachycardia are likely due to adrenal insufficiency secondary to ACTH deficiency.",9
7653,"The patient is a 26-year-old woman at 28 weeks' gestation with elevated blood pressure readings, indicating gestational hypertension. Her blood pressure has increased significantly from 128/84 mm Hg to 163/105 mm Hg over the course of her pregnancy. There is no proteinuria or other signs of preeclampsia, as her urinalysis is normal and her blood tests are within reference ranges. The most appropriate management for severe hypertension (blood pressure ≥160/110 mm Hg) during pregnancy is to initiate antihypertensive therapy to prevent complications such as stroke or placental abruption. Magnesium sulfate is used for seizure prophylaxis in preeclampsia, not for blood pressure control. Lisinopril is contraindicated in pregnancy due to potential fetal harm. Complete bed rest is not a recommended treatment for severe hypertension. Hydralazine is a safe antihypertensive medication for use in pregnancy and is appropriate for acute management of severe hypertension.",9
5614,"The clinical presentation of the child suggests a condition related to sun sensitivity and skin changes upon exposure to sunlight. The key details include the onset of symptoms in sun-exposed areas, worsening after sun exposure, and the consanguineous parentage, which suggests a possible genetic disorder. The symptoms are consistent with xeroderma pigmentosum, a condition caused by defects in nucleotide-excision DNA repair. This disorder leads to an inability to repair DNA damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) light, resulting in the described skin changes. The absence of blistering and scarring helps differentiate it from other photosensitivity disorders. Therefore, the most likely disrupted process in this patient is nucleotide-excision DNA repair.",9
7665,"The clinical presentation of the patient includes violent behavior, altered mental status, fever, tachycardia, and vertical nystagmus. These symptoms are characteristic of phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication. PCP is known to cause agitation, hallucinations, and nystagmus, particularly vertical nystagmus, which is a classic sign. While ketamine and dextromethorphan can also cause dissociative symptoms, vertical nystagmus is more specifically associated with PCP. Mescaline, a hallucinogen, does not typically cause nystagmus or the violent behavior seen here.",9
5617,"The patient's presentation is consistent with nephrotic syndrome, characterized by proteinuria, edema, and foamy urine. The renal biopsy findings of basement membrane thickening and subepithelial deposits on electron microscopy suggest membranous nephropathy. Membranous nephropathy is often associated with antibodies to the phospholipase A2 receptor, which is a characteristic finding in this condition.",9
5628,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS), characterized by episodes of neurological symptoms that resolve on their own, such as weakness or numbness, and now sudden unilateral vision loss with eye pain, which is indicative of optic neuritis. In MS, one common finding is Lhermitte's sign, which is an electrical sensation that runs down the back and into the limbs upon neck flexion. This is due to demyelination in the cervical spinal cord. The other options do not align with typical MS findings: ipsilateral loss of proprioception and vibration sensation suggests a different type of lesion, symmetric lower extremity reflex loss is not typical of MS, and weakness with repeat exertion is more indicative of a neuromuscular junction disorder like myasthenia gravis.",9
5620,"The patient's symptoms of dysphagia, regurgitation of undigested food, and the presence of a neck mass that becomes prominent when coughing suggest a pharyngoesophageal diverticulum, specifically a Zenker's diverticulum. Zenker's diverticulum is caused by increased intrapharyngeal pressure leading to herniation of the mucosa through an area of weakness in the muscular wall of the pharynx, known as Killian's triangle. This increased pressure is often due to dysfunction of the cricopharyngeal muscle. The barium swallow showing accumulation of contrast at the C5 level supports this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause is increased intrapharyngeal pressure.",9
5602,"The patient is seeking emergency contraception after having unprotected intercourse. Her last menstrual period was 12 days ago, placing her in the middle of her cycle, which is a high-risk time for ovulation and potential fertilization. She is also seeking a long-term contraceptive solution that ensures privacy from her parents. 

Emergency contraception options include ulipristal acetate, levonorgestrel, and the copper IUD. Ulipristal acetate is a selective progesterone receptor modulator effective up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse and can prevent ovulation. The copper IUD can also be used for emergency contraception up to 5 days after intercourse and provides long-term contraception.

Administering combined oral contraceptives is not appropriate for immediate emergency contraception as they are not as effective as ulipristal or the copper IUD.

The progestin IUD is not used for emergency contraception but can be considered for long-term contraception after addressing immediate needs.

Given the immediate need for emergency contraception and her desire for long-term contraception, the copper IUD is the most appropriate as it addresses both these needs and is highly effective as a long-term method.",9
7681,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a rectocele, which is a bulging of the posterior vaginal wall due to weakness in the supporting structures between the rectum and the vagina. The key finding is the bulging of the posterior vaginal wall during the Valsalva maneuver, which indicates a defect in the support of the rectum. The rectovaginal fascia is the structure that provides support between the rectum and the vagina. Weakness in this fascia can lead to the formation of a rectocele, causing symptoms such as pelvic pain, constipation, fecal urgency, and a sensation of incomplete evacuation.",9
5634,"The clinical presentation of recurrent bacterial infections and very low levels of serum immunoglobulin in a young child suggests a possible immunodeficiency disorder. The most common immunodeficiency with these features is X-linked agammaglobulinemia (Bruton's agammaglobulinemia), which is characterized by a lack of mature B cells due to a mutation in the BTK gene. To confirm this diagnosis, it is important to assess the presence of B cells. Flow cytometry is the appropriate test to evaluate the presence and quantity of B cells in the blood. This test will help determine if there is a deficiency or absence of B cells, which is indicative of X-linked agammaglobulinemia.",9
7693,"The clinical presentation described is consistent with cerebral palsy, characterized by abnormal muscle tone, delayed motor milestones, and persistent primitive reflexes. The patient exhibits spasticity, as indicated by the velocity-dependent increase in tone and hyperreflexia. The most common risk factor for cerebral palsy is prematurity, which is associated with periventricular leukomalacia and other brain injuries that can lead to this condition. While perinatal hypoxic injury is also a known risk factor, prematurity is more prevalent as a risk factor for cerebral palsy.",9
7702,"The patient's presentation includes fever, headache, blurry vision, exophthalmos, decreased extraocular movements, and decreased sensation in the V1 and V2 distribution. These symptoms suggest involvement of the structures within the cavernous sinus. The rapid progression of symptoms, including altered mental status, aligns with a serious condition like cavernous sinus thrombosis. This condition can cause cranial nerve deficits (CN III, IV, V1, V2, and VI) due to their proximity to the cavernous sinus, leading to the observed ophthalmoplegia and sensory changes. The fever and systemic symptoms suggest an infectious or inflammatory process, which is consistent with cavernous sinus thrombosis, often secondary to infection. Other options like acute closed angle glaucoma, periorbital cellulitis, and intracranial hemorrhage do not fully explain the combination of cranial nerve involvement and systemic symptoms.",9
5665,"In this scenario, the patient has been diagnosed with gonorrhea, which is a sexually transmitted infection that is legally required to be reported to public health authorities. This is important for public health surveillance and control of the spread of the infection. While patient confidentiality is important, the law mandates reporting certain infectious diseases to protect public health. Therefore, the physician must inform the patient that gonorrhea is a reportable disease and that it will be reported to the health department. This is not a matter of choice for the patient or the physician, as it is a legal requirement. The physician should also counsel the patient on the importance of informing her partner to prevent further transmission and complications. However, the primary action required by law is to report the case to the health department.",9
7710,"The patient has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus, recurrent miscarriages, a stroke, and deep vein thrombosis, which are suggestive of a hypercoagulable state. The prolonged aPTT that does not correct with mixing studies indicates the presence of an inhibitor rather than a factor deficiency. The positive VDRL test, which is a nonspecific test for syphilis but can be positive in antiphospholipid syndrome, further supports this diagnosis. Antiphospholipid syndrome is characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, which can cause both arterial and venous thrombosis and pregnancy complications. This aligns with the patient's clinical presentation.",9
7714,"The clinical presentation of the patient suggests opioid overdose, characterized by lethargy, cyanosis, and pinpoint pupils, along with respiratory depression (respiratory rate of 8/min). This respiratory depression leads to hypoventilation, causing an increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) retention. The increased CO2 results in respiratory acidosis. In respiratory acidosis, we expect the pH to be decreased due to the increased CO2 (Pco2: increased). The kidneys may attempt to compensate by increasing bicarbonate (HCO3-) levels, but this compensation takes time and may not be evident in acute settings. Therefore, the most likely ABG findings in this acute scenario would be decreased pH, increased Pco2, and possibly increased HCO3- if there is some degree of compensation. However, the primary change is the increased Pco2 with decreased pH.",9
5672,"The patient presents with a raised, hyperpigmented, rubbery scar that extends beyond the boundaries of the initial incision, which is characteristic of a keloid. Keloids are more common in individuals with darker skin, such as African Americans, and can occur after surgical procedures. They are known for excessive deposition of collagen, particularly type III collagen, during the wound healing process. This excessive collagen deposition leads to the raised and extended nature of the scar. Type I collagen is more associated with normal scar formation, while type II collagen is found in cartilage, and elastin is involved in skin elasticity but not in keloid formation. Therefore, the abnormal deposition of type III collagen is most likely responsible for the appearance of this patient’s scar.",9
5671,"The patient presents with jaundice and icterus, with laboratory findings showing mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. She has had multiple similar episodes, and there is no significant past medical history or symptoms of hemolysis such as fatigue or anemia. Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I is associated with severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and usually presents in infancy with neurological symptoms due to kernicterus. Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II is less severe but still presents with higher levels of unconjugated bilirubin than seen in this patient. Hemolytic anemia would typically present with additional symptoms such as fatigue, pallor, and possibly splenomegaly, along with laboratory evidence of hemolysis (e.g., elevated reticulocyte count, low haptoglobin). Gilbert syndrome is a common, benign condition characterized by mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, often triggered by stress, fasting, or illness, and fits the clinical picture of this patient.",9
5684,"In the context of an allergic response, TH2 cells play a crucial role in mediating the immune response to allergens such as pollen. TH2 cells secrete cytokines that influence B-cell class switching. Specifically, IL-4 is the cytokine secreted by TH2 cells that induces B-cells to switch to producing IgE antibodies. IgE is the antibody class associated with allergic reactions. IFN-gamma is associated with TH1 responses, IL-17 is associated with TH17 responses, and TGF-beta is involved in regulatory T-cell functions and other immune processes, but not specifically in class switching to IgE.",9
5669,"The clinical presentation of this patient suggests placental abruption, which is characterized by vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, uterine tenderness, and contractions. The history of cocaine use is a significant risk factor for placental abruption due to its vasoconstrictive effects, which can lead to abrupt constriction of maternal and placental vessels, resulting in separation of the placenta from the uterine wall. The patient's hypertension also supports this diagnosis. The fetal heart rate of 110/min indicates fetal distress, which is consistent with placental abruption. The absence of trauma and the presence of a bloody perineum further support this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's condition is abrupt constriction of maternal and placental vessels due to cocaine use.",9
7651,"The patient is a 16-year-old girl with primary amenorrhea, clitoromegaly, absence of uterus and ovaries, and mild facial hair, presenting with a phenotype more consistent with virilization. The presence of pubic hair and body hair suggests some androgen effect. The key features here include: 1) absence of the uterus, 2) presence of clitoromegaly, 3) breast development at Tanner stage 1 (no glandular breast tissue), and 4) coarse pubic hair. 

Complete androgen insensitivity (answer D) would typically show breast development due to the conversion of testosterone to estrogen, but no pubic or axillary hair development due to lack of androgen effects. This doesn't match the patient's presentation.

5-α reductase deficiency (answer A) would involve a male (XY) individual with ambiguous genitalia at birth, typically raised as female, who would undergo virilization at puberty. The absence of internal female structures (such as the uterus and ovaries) and clitoromegaly are consistent with a virilizing condition in a genetic male, matching this deficiency.

Sex chromosome monosomy (answer B), like Turner syndrome, would involve short stature and other distinct phenotypic features, and presence of streak ovaries, not the absence of the uterus and ovaries.

21-hydroxylase deficiency (answer C), a form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, usually involves salt-wasting in severe cases and is associated with ambiguous genitalia in genetic females but also doesn't match the ultrasound findings.

Thus, the most likely condition that fits the described presentation is 5-α reductase deficiency (answer A), as it explains the absence of uterus and ovaries, clitoromegaly, and presence of pubic hair due to testosterone effects during puberty.",9
5685,"The clinical presentation suggests hereditary spherocytosis, characterized by hemolytic anemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly. The peripheral blood smear shows spherocytes, which are round erythrocytes lacking central pallor. In hereditary spherocytosis, the spleen enlarges due to increased workload as it removes the defective spherocytes from circulation. This is known as work hypertrophy, where the spleen becomes enlarged due to increased activity in filtering and destroying the abnormal red blood cells.",9
5701,"The clinical presentation is consistent with a communicating hydrocele. The key features include a scrotal swelling that is soft, fluctuant, and transilluminates, indicating it is fluid-filled. The swelling is intermittent and changes with position, suggesting a communication with the peritoneal cavity. In infants, many communicating hydroceles resolve spontaneously by 1 year of age as the processus vaginalis closes. Therefore, the most appropriate management at this stage is observation with reassurance and follow-up, as surgical intervention is not immediately necessary unless it persists beyond 1 year or causes complications.",9
7743,"In this situation, the physician must balance ethical considerations, including respect for patient autonomy and cultural sensitivity. The children’s request to withhold information from their father may be based on cultural beliefs or a desire to protect him. The appropriate first step is to explore the reasoning behind the children's request. This allows the physician to understand their perspective and address any cultural or emotional concerns. After understanding their reasoning, the physician can discuss the importance of patient autonomy and the ethical obligation to inform the patient, potentially involving the patient in the decision-making process if appropriate.",9
7741,"The patient's symptoms of paroxysmal coughing followed by gasping for air, along with the laboratory finding of lymphocytosis, are suggestive of pertussis (whooping cough). Despite being up to date on vaccinations, pertussis can still occur, especially in young adults. The best next step in management for suspected pertussis, especially when the clinical presentation is classic, is to start treatment with a macrolide antibiotic such as azithromycin. This is because early treatment can help reduce the spread of the infection and may also reduce the severity and duration of symptoms. While PCR testing for Bordetella pertussis can confirm the diagnosis, treatment should not be delayed while awaiting results if clinical suspicion is high. Therefore, the best next step is to initiate treatment with azithromycin.",9
5710,"The patient is a 16-year-old girl with primary amenorrhea, delayed puberty (Tanner stage 2), and hypertension. These findings suggest a disorder of sexual development, possibly due to a form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). The hypertension and delayed puberty are key clues. In CAH, 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency is characterized by hypertension and hypogonadism due to impaired production of sex steroids. This enzyme deficiency leads to decreased production of cortisol and sex steroids, and increased production of mineralocorticoids, causing hypertension. The lack of sex steroid production results in low levels of androstenedione, which is a precursor to testosterone and estrogen. Therefore, the expected laboratory abnormality in this patient is low levels of androstenedione.",9
5706,"The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on dialysis, which often leads to anemia due to decreased erythropoietin production by the kidneys. The patient was started on recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) to address this anemia. Despite EPO treatment, the patient's hemoglobin has not significantly improved, suggesting another underlying issue, likely iron deficiency, which is common in dialysis patients due to blood loss during dialysis and reduced iron absorption. Iron deficiency anemia typically presents with low MCV (microcytic anemia), increased RDW (anisocytosis), decreased ferritin (iron stores), and decreased transferrin saturation (iron availability).",9
5698,"The patient presents with increased urinary frequency, dry mouth, and excessive thirst, which suggests a problem with water balance. Her serum sodium is low (130 mEq/L), and her serum osmolality is also low (265 mOsmol/kg), indicating a state of dilution. Her urine osmolality is initially low (230 mOsmol/kg), which suggests that her kidneys are excreting dilute urine despite her low serum osmolality. This is consistent with either primary polydipsia or diabetes insipidus.

After water restriction, her serum osmolality increases to 280 mOsmol/kg, and her urine osmolality increases significantly to 650 mOsmol/kg. This indicates that her kidneys are capable of concentrating urine when water intake is restricted, which rules out nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (where the kidneys cannot concentrate urine even with water restriction).

The ability to concentrate urine after water restriction suggests that the problem is not with the kidneys' response to antidiuretic hormone (ADH), but rather with excessive water intake diluting the serum. This is consistent with primary polydipsia, where excessive water intake leads to dilutional hyponatremia and low serum osmolality, but the kidneys can concentrate urine when water intake is restricted.

Cerebral salt wasting is unlikely because it typically presents with hypovolemia and high urine sodium, which is not indicated here. Diabetes mellitus would present with hyperglycemia and glucosuria, which is not the case here.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is primary polydipsia.",9
5709,"The patient's symptoms and findings are suggestive of a left internal carotid artery dissection. The severe headache and neck pain, along with transient ischemic symptoms (right upper extremity weakness and transient vision loss), and Horner's syndrome (ptosis and miosis on the left side) are classic for carotid artery dissection. The absence of flow in the left internal carotid artery on duplex ultrasonography supports this diagnosis. In cases of carotid artery dissection, anticoagulation with heparin is typically the first-line treatment to prevent thromboembolic events. Alteplase is used for acute ischemic stroke within a specific time window, but this patient does not have an acute stroke on imaging. Mannitol is used for reducing intracranial pressure, and 100% oxygen is used for cluster headaches or carbon monoxide poisoning, neither of which are relevant here. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is the administration of heparin.",9
5711,"The newborn presents with jaundice, pale stools, and elevated direct bilirubin, indicating conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The elevated alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl transferase suggest cholestasis. These findings are consistent with biliary atresia, a condition where the bile ducts are obstructed, leading to liver damage. If untreated, biliary atresia can progress to liver cirrhosis. The risk of kernicterus is associated with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which is not the case here. Hepatocellular carcinoma is not a typical early complication of biliary atresia. Dark pigmentation on liver biopsy is not a recognized complication in this context. Therefore, the patient is at increased risk of developing early liver cirrhosis due to ongoing liver damage from biliary atresia.",9
7757,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), also known as IgA vasculitis. The key features include the history of a recent upper respiratory infection (sore throat), palpable purpura on the lower extremities, abdominal pain, arthralgia, and renal involvement (hematuria with dysmorphic RBCs). The ultrasound finding of alternating echogenic and hypoechogenic bands in the bowel is indicative of intussusception, which can occur in HSP due to bowel wall edema. The underlying pathophysiology of HSP involves the deposition of IgA immune complexes in small vessels, leading to the symptoms observed. Therefore, the most likely cause of these findings is the deposition of IgA immune complexes.",9
7761,"The boy presents with symptoms consistent with lead poisoning, including lethargy, confusion, abdominal pain, constipation, and anemia. His home, built in the early 1900s, likely has lead-based paint, which is a common source of lead exposure in children. The venous lead level of 55 ug/dL confirms significant lead poisoning. In cases of lead poisoning with levels between 45-69 ug/dL, oral chelation therapy with succimer is recommended to reduce the lead burden. Other options like folic acid, docusate, and psyllium do not address the lead toxicity directly.",9
5713,"The patient is experiencing an anaphylactic reaction shortly after receiving a blood transfusion, which is characterized by pruritus, wheezing, and hypotension. This suggests an IgA deficiency, which is the most common primary immunodeficiency. Patients with IgA deficiency can have recurrent infections and are at risk for anaphylactic reactions to blood products containing IgA. The key underlying issue in IgA deficiency is impaired production of secretory immunoglobulins, specifically IgA. The other options do not align with the clinical presentation: absence of neutrophilic reactive oxygen species is related to chronic granulomatous disease, dysfunction of phagosome-lysosome fusion is related to Chediak-Higashi syndrome, and absence of mature circulating B cells is related to X-linked agammaglobulinemia.",9
5724,"The patient's symptoms are indicative of Wernicke's aphasia, characterized by fluent speech that lacks meaning, poor comprehension, and inability to repeat phrases. Wernicke's aphasia is typically caused by damage to the Wernicke's area, which is located in the superior temporal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere (usually the left hemisphere in right-handed individuals). The CT scan showing an acute stroke in the left hemisphere aligns with this diagnosis. The inferior frontal gyrus is associated with Broca's aphasia, the precentral gyrus is related to motor function, and the watershed zone is associated with different types of aphasia or other deficits depending on the specific areas affected. Therefore, the superior temporal gyrus is the structure most likely damaged in this case.",9
5741,"The clinical presentation of this 6-month-old boy suggests a primary immunodeficiency. The key features include recurrent infections (pneumonia, gastroenteritis), failure to thrive, oral thrush, and an absent thymic shadow on chest x-ray. These findings are indicative of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), which is characterized by a profound defect in both T-cell and B-cell immunity. The absent thymic shadow suggests a lack of T-cell development. Among the options, an IL-2 receptor gamma chain defect is the most common cause of X-linked SCID, which fits the clinical picture of this patient.",9
5738,"The patient's symptoms of flank pain radiating to the groin, along with hematuria on the urinary dipstick, are highly suggestive of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones). Given her history of recurrent urinary tract infections, she may be at increased risk for certain types of stones, such as struvite stones. The most appropriate initial test to confirm the presence of kidney stones is imaging. While a contrast CT scan is very effective in identifying stones, a non-contrast CT scan is typically preferred to avoid potential complications from contrast, especially in the setting of possible renal impairment (indicated by mild azotemia). However, the question asks for the most useful initial test, and renal ultrasonography is often used initially in the emergency setting to identify hydronephrosis or large stones, especially in women of childbearing age to avoid radiation exposure. Therefore, renal ultrasonography is the most appropriate initial test in this scenario.",9
7810,"The patient presents with hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS), as indicated by the extremely high serum glucose, high serum osmolality, and absence of significant ketosis (negative beta-hydroxybutyrate and trace ketones in urine). The initial management of HHS involves aggressive fluid resuscitation with normal saline to address dehydration and hyperosmolality. However, the patient also has hypokalemia (serum potassium of 3 mEq/L), which is a critical finding. Insulin therapy, which is necessary to lower blood glucose, can further lower potassium levels by driving potassium into cells. Therefore, before starting insulin, it is crucial to address the hypokalemia to prevent life-threatening complications such as cardiac arrhythmias. Thus, the best next step is to add potassium to the intravenous fluids to correct the hypokalemia before initiating insulin therapy.",9
7792,"The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as indicated by his smoking history, symptoms, and chest radiograph findings (flattened diaphragm, hyperlucency of the lungs, and long, narrow heart shadow). His low oxygen saturation (88%) suggests significant hypoxemia. In COPD, long-term supplemental oxygen therapy is known to reduce mortality in patients with severe resting hypoxemia (PaO2 ≤ 55 mmHg or SaO2 ≤ 88%). Other options like prophylactic azithromycin, roflumilast, and pulmonary rehabilitation can help manage symptoms and reduce exacerbations but do not have the same impact on mortality as supplemental oxygen in patients with severe hypoxemia.",9
5752,"The p-value is a measure of the probability that the observed difference (or a more extreme difference) would occur by chance if there were no actual difference between the groups (i.e., if the null hypothesis were true). A p-value of 0.052 indicates that there is a 5.2% probability of observing an 11 mg/dL or greater difference in LDL reduction between the two groups purely by chance, assuming that the two statins have identical effects. Typically, a p-value less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant, meaning that the observed difference is unlikely to have occurred by chance. Since 0.052 is slightly above 0.05, it is not considered statistically significant. Therefore, the best description of the p-value is that there is a 5% chance of observing the difference by chance if the null hypothesis is true.",9
7813,"The clinical presentation of the 6-year-old boy suggests a condition affecting the hip joint. He has acute onset of hip pain, a limp, and a history of a recent upper respiratory infection. The physical examination shows the hip is slightly abducted and externally rotated, but there is no tenderness, warmth, or erythema, and he is able to bear weight. Laboratory studies are mostly normal, with a slightly elevated temperature and normal inflammatory markers. Ultrasound shows increased fluid in the joint, indicating an effusion, but X-rays are normal.

Given these findings, transient synovitis is the most likely diagnosis. It is a common cause of hip pain in children, often following a viral infection, and is characterized by joint effusion without significant systemic symptoms or laboratory abnormalities. The other options are less likely: 

- Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) typically occurs in older children and adolescents and is associated with obesity and abnormal X-ray findings.
- Legg-Calve-Perthes disease involves avascular necrosis of the femoral head, usually presenting with a more chronic course and abnormal X-rays.
- Developmental dysplasia of the hip is usually diagnosed in infants and would not present acutely in a 6-year-old.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is transient synovitis.",9
5783,"The patient is an HIV-positive individual with profuse watery diarrhea and significant weight loss. The stool exam with a modified acid-fast stain revealing organisms suggests an infection with Cryptosporidium, which is common in immunocompromised patients like those with HIV/AIDS. Cryptosporidiosis is known to cause watery diarrhea in such patients. The best treatment for Cryptosporidium in immunocompromised patients is Nitazoxanide, although restoring immune function with antiretroviral therapy is also crucial. Supportive therapy is important but not sufficient as the sole treatment. Therefore, the best treatment option given the choices is Nitazoxanide.",9
5766,"The clinical presentation of the patient suggests homocystinuria, a disorder often due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency. Key features include lens subluxation, intellectual disability, marfanoid habitus (tall stature, long fingers), and thromboembolic events (suggested by the neurological symptoms). In homocystinuria, there is an accumulation of homocysteine and a deficiency of cysteine. Treatment often involves supplementation with vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), as some patients are responsive to it, along with dietary management to reduce methionine and increase cysteine intake. Therefore, the patient is most likely to respond to supplementation of vitamin B6.",9
7837,"The patient presents with hearing loss and tinnitus, which are key symptoms of ototoxicity. She has a history of recent chemotherapy with cisplatin and docetaxel, and is on medications including aspirin and furosemide. Cisplatin is well-known for causing ototoxicity, particularly high-frequency hearing loss and tinnitus, due to its effects on the cochlea. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, can also cause ototoxicity, especially when used in high doses or in patients with renal impairment. However, the hearing loss in this case improved significantly after two weeks, which is more consistent with reversible ototoxicity. Aspirin can cause reversible tinnitus and hearing loss, especially at high doses, but the patient is not reported to be on high doses. Given the improvement in hearing and the patient's renal impairment, furosemide is the most likely cause of the reversible hearing loss. The patient's renal function worsened, which could have increased the risk of furosemide-induced ototoxicity.",9
5801,"The patient's symptoms of headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, palpitations, facial flushing, and sweating after consuming alcohol are consistent with a disulfiram-like reaction. This reaction occurs when alcohol is consumed while taking certain medications, such as metronidazole. Metronidazole is commonly used to treat infections caused by Trichomonas vaginalis. The timing of the symptoms, starting after alcohol consumption, and the recent treatment for a genitourinary infection suggest that the patient was likely treated with metronidazole for Trichomonas vaginalis. Other pathogens listed, such as Herpes simplex virus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Candida albicans, are not typically treated with medications that cause a disulfiram-like reaction.",9
5795,"The clinical presentation of this 2-year-old boy is consistent with nephrotic syndrome, characterized by generalized edema, proteinuria, and hypoalbuminemia. The key findings include facial and leg edema, 4+ proteinuria, and low serum albumin. The presence of fatty casts in the urine is also indicative of nephrotic syndrome. In children, the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome is minimal change disease, which is responsible for the majority of cases in this age group. Acute glomerulonephritis typically presents with hematuria, hypertension, and less severe proteinuria, which is not the case here. Congestive heart failure would present with additional signs such as respiratory distress and is less likely in a child with normal vital signs. Protein-losing enteropathy would not typically present with such significant proteinuria. Therefore, the most likely etiology is minimal change disease.",9
5802,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is characterized by morning stiffness, symmetrical joint involvement, and elevated inflammatory markers such as ESR. The joints affected include the wrists, metacarpophalangeal (MCP), and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints. A classic laboratory finding in RA is the presence of rheumatoid factor (RF), which are IgM antibodies directed against the Fc portion of IgG antibodies. This is consistent with option D.",9
7852,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with tetanus, which is caused by the bacterium Clostridium tetani. The key symptoms include muscle spasms, jaw stiffness (trismus), and generalized muscle rigidity. The history of stepping on a nail suggests a potential entry point for the bacterium. Clostridium tetani produces tetanospasmin, an exotoxin that cleaves SNARE proteins, specifically targeting inhibitory neurons. This prevents the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters like GABA and glycine, leading to unopposed muscle contraction and spasms. This mechanism aligns with option C.",9
5807,"The hormone secreted by S cells is secretin. Secretin is released in response to acidic chyme entering the duodenum. Its primary role is to neutralize the acid by stimulating the pancreas to secrete bicarbonate-rich fluid into the duodenum. This increases duodenal HCO3- secretion. Secretin also inhibits gastric acid secretion, leading to a decrease in gastric H+ secretion. Additionally, secretin decreases duodenal Cl- secretion as bicarbonate is exchanged for chloride in the pancreatic duct cells. Therefore, the effects of secretin are a decrease in gastric H+ secretion, an increase in duodenal HCO3- secretion, and a decrease in duodenal Cl- secretion.",9
7854,"The patient's symptoms and lab findings suggest a diagnosis of acromegaly, likely due to a pituitary adenoma secreting excess growth hormone. The symptoms include headaches, weight gain, and enlargement of extremities (e.g., feet not fitting into shoes). The hypertension and edema could be related to the effects of growth hormone. The use of captopril, an ACE inhibitor, led to an increase in creatinine, which can happen in patients with renal artery stenosis. The 'string-of-beads' appearance on angiography is characteristic of fibromuscular dysplasia, which can cause renal artery stenosis and secondary hypertension. This is consistent with the patient's presentation of hypertension and renal function changes after starting an ACE inhibitor.",9
5837,"The clinical presentation suggests an acute allergic reaction, likely urticaria (hives), following shellfish consumption. The rash is itchy, erythematous, and blanching, consistent with hives. The absence of respiratory distress or laryngeal swelling indicates that this is not an anaphylactic reaction, which would require immediate epinephrine. Topical corticosteroids are not effective for urticaria, and systemic corticosteroids like prednisone are not first-line for acute urticaria. Antihistamines are the treatment of choice for symptomatic relief of urticaria. Cetirizine, a second-generation antihistamine, is effective for treating hives and is less sedating than first-generation antihistamines.",9
7876,"The clinical presentation suggests a metabolic disorder related to fasting hypoglycemia. The key points are the hypoglycemia with absent ketones, mild hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated liver enzymes. The absence of ketones during hypoglycemia indicates a problem with fatty acid oxidation, as ketones are typically produced when glucose is low and fatty acids are used for energy. The family history of a relative with similar symptoms when not eating regularly also supports a metabolic disorder.

Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency is a common fatty acid oxidation disorder that presents with hypoketotic hypoglycemia, especially during fasting or illness. The absence of ketones in the presence of hypoglycemia is a hallmark of this condition. The elevated liver enzymes and mild hepatosplenomegaly can occur due to liver stress from the metabolic crisis.

Therefore, the most likely deficiency in this patient is acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, specifically related to medium-chain fatty acids.",9
5833,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of ascites, as indicated by shifting dullness on physical examination. He also has a history of polycythemia vera, which can lead to Budd-Chiari syndrome due to hepatic vein thrombosis. The laboratory findings show elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit, consistent with polycythemia vera. The diagnostic paracentesis shows a serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) of 1.6 g/dL (3.8 - 2.2), indicating portal hypertension as the cause of ascites. The most likely cause of portal hypertension in this patient is Budd-Chiari syndrome. To confirm this diagnosis, imaging of the hepatic veins is necessary. Ultrasound is the best initial test to evaluate for Budd-Chiari syndrome as it can identify hepatic vein thrombosis and assess blood flow.",9
7901,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), including fever, productive cough, and crackles on lung auscultation. Her vital signs indicate tachycardia and tachypnea, and she has a history of smoking and comorbid conditions like diabetes and hypertension, which increase her risk for complications. The elevated leukocyte count and ESR support an infectious process. Given her age, comorbidities, and the severity of symptoms (high fever, tachypnea), inpatient treatment is warranted. The recommended inpatient treatment for CAP in patients with comorbidities typically includes a beta-lactam (such as ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) plus a macrolide (such as azithromycin) to cover both typical and atypical pathogens. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is inpatient treatment with azithromycin and cefotaxime.",9
5854,"The clinical presentation of the woman's son is consistent with erythema infectiosum (fifth disease), caused by parvovirus B19. This condition is characterized by a ""slapped cheek"" rash followed by a lacy, reticular rash on the body. In pregnant women, parvovirus B19 infection can lead to fetal complications such as hydrops fetalis, especially if the mother is infected during the first half of pregnancy. The most appropriate next step is to determine if the mother has been infected by checking her serologic status for parvovirus B19. This involves testing for virus-specific IgG and IgM antibodies. If she is IgM positive, it indicates a recent infection, and further fetal monitoring would be necessary. Therefore, the next step is maternal serologic assays for virus-specific IgG and IgM.",9
7819,"The patient presents with symptoms and ultrasound findings consistent with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left popliteal vein. The standard initial management of DVT includes anticoagulation to prevent clot extension and embolization. However, the question asks for the most appropriate next step in management after initiating anticoagulation.

In this case, the patient has no personal or family history of serious illness and his last colonoscopy was normal. There is no indication for a colonoscopy at this time. Streptokinase therapy is not typically used for DVT unless there is a massive pulmonary embolism or limb-threatening thrombosis, which is not the case here. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter is usually considered in cases where anticoagulation is contraindicated or if there is recurrent thromboembolism despite anticoagulation.

A chest X-ray is a reasonable next step to rule out any pulmonary complications, such as a pulmonary embolism, especially since the patient has a confirmed DVT and could potentially have an asymptomatic PE. Therefore, the most appropriate next step after initiating anticoagulation is a chest X-ray to evaluate for any pulmonary involvement.",9
7904,"This patient presents with erectile dysfunction (ED) and lacks morning erections, suggesting an organic cause rather than a psychological one. His nocturnal penile tumescence test also shows absence of erections, reinforcing the idea of an organic cause. He has a history of coronary artery disease for which he takes isosorbide dinitrate, a nitrate medication.

Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, is commonly used to treat erectile dysfunction. However, it is contraindicated in patients taking nitrates like isosorbide dinitrate due to the risk of severe hypotension. Since the absence of nocturnal erections and morning erections points away from psychogenic causes, referring to a psychiatrist is less appropriate.

Given that the use of sildenafil is contraindicated due to nitrate use, we must look for alternative solutions. Stopping isosorbide dinitrate without consulting his cardiologist might not be safe since it’s prescribed for angina and should not be discontinued abruptly.

Therefore, the best initial step in the management of this specific patient scenario involves checking prolactin levels, as the hormonal cause could be contributing to the erectile dysfunction and would guide further treatment without interfering with his current medications.",9
5869,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), likely due to his extensive smoking history. The plethoric face, distended jugular veins, and lower extremity edema suggest right-sided heart failure, or cor pulmonale, secondary to pulmonary hypertension. The bilateral wheezing and history of smoking support the diagnosis of COPD. In COPD, especially in the chronic bronchitis phenotype, hypoxia and hypercapnia can lead to pulmonary vasoconstriction and elevated pulmonary artery pressure, causing right heart strain and failure. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms, including the signs of right-sided heart failure, is elevated pulmonary artery pressure due to chronic lung disease.",9
5870,"The patient is experiencing symptoms consistent with an adjustment disorder with depressed mood following a significant life stressor (his wife leaving him). He has been drinking alcohol, but it is not clear that he has an alcohol use disorder that requires disulfiram therapy. He is not suicidal, so hospitalization is not necessary. Alprazolam, a benzodiazepine, is not appropriate as it can be addictive and may worsen his alcohol use. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a suitable option for helping him cope with his stress and depressive symptoms.",9
5872,"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with abetalipoproteinemia, a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). This condition leads to an inability to properly form and secrete lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein B, resulting in very low levels of triglycerides and cholesterol in the blood. The symptoms include steatorrhea (foul-smelling stools), failure to thrive, and neurological issues due to fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. 

The treatment focuses on dietary modifications to manage symptoms and prevent complications. Specifically, patients are advised to restrict long-chain fatty acids and instead consume medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which do not require chylomicron formation for absorption. Additionally, supplementation with fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) is necessary to prevent deficiencies.

Given this information, the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition is the restriction of long-chain fatty acids, making option B the correct choice.",9
5873,"The patient presents with severe back pain, fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis, which are suggestive of an infectious process. His history of IV drug use increases the risk for infections such as a spinal epidural abscess. The tenderness over the spine and exacerbation of pain with movement further support this diagnosis. The elevated CRP also indicates inflammation or infection. While malingering could be considered due to his drug-seeking behavior, the presence of fever and leukocytosis makes an infectious cause more likely. A herniated disc or musculoskeletal strain would not typically cause fever and leukocytosis.",9
5878,"The patient's symptoms and history are suggestive of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), likely emphysema, given the smoking history and the chest radiograph findings of hyperinflation. In COPD, particularly emphysema, the FEV1/FVC ratio is typically reduced due to airflow obstruction. A normal FEV1/FVC ratio is around 70-80%, so a ratio of 65% would indicate obstruction. Decreased total lung capacity is more indicative of restrictive lung disease, which is not suggested by the hyperinflation seen on the chest radiograph. Increased DLCO is not typical for emphysema; in fact, DLCO is usually decreased due to destruction of alveolar-capillary units. An FEV1/FVC of 80% with an FEV1 of 82% would suggest normal lung function, which is inconsistent with the clinical presentation of COPD. Therefore, the most likely finding is a reduced FEV1/FVC ratio, consistent with obstructive lung disease.",9
5881,"The patient presents with altered mental status, fever, neck stiffness, and pain, which are suggestive of meningitis. In an elderly patient, common causes of bacterial meningitis include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Listeria monocytogenes. The empiric treatment for bacterial meningitis in an elderly patient typically includes ceftriaxone and vancomycin to cover S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis, and ampicillin to cover L. monocytogenes. Steroids, specifically dexamethasone, are often added to reduce inflammation and neurological complications, especially in cases of suspected pneumococcal meningitis. Therefore, the best next step in management is to start empiric antibiotic therapy along with steroids.",9
5885,"The patient presents with signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and a depressed skull fracture, likely leading to a traumatic brain injury. The clinical signs include a low heart rate (bradycardia), hypertension, and altered mental status, which are components of Cushing's triad, indicating increased ICP. The CT scan, although not visible here, likely shows evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or edema. In such cases, monitoring and managing ICP is crucial. Placement of an intraventricular catheter allows for direct measurement of ICP and can also be used to drain cerebrospinal fluid to relieve pressure. Other options like lumbar puncture are contraindicated in the presence of increased ICP due to the risk of brain herniation. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is unnecessary given the negative FAST exam, and a brain MRI is not immediately useful in acute management. Therefore, the most appropriate procedure is placement of an intraventricular catheter.",9
5887,"Hydroxyurea is a medication used in sickle cell disease to increase fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels. Fetal hemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen compared to adult hemoglobin (HbA and HbS). By increasing HbF, hydroxyurea reduces the sickling of red blood cells and decreases the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises. Therefore, the most likely effect of hydroxyurea is an increase in hemoglobin with higher oxygen affinity, which corresponds to an increase in HbF.",9
7939,"The clinical presentation of this 14-year-old boy, including vomiting, lethargy, confusion, optic disc swelling, hepatomegaly, and hypoglycemia, is suggestive of Reye's syndrome. Reye's syndrome is associated with the use of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) in children, especially following a viral infection. Aspirin is known to cause irreversible inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which is not listed as an option. However, aspirin also has the effect of decreasing uric acid elimination, which can lead to hyperuricemia. This matches option A. The other options do not align with the known effects of aspirin: reversible inhibition of COX-1 is not correct for aspirin, decreased expression of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa is not an effect of aspirin, and irreversible inhibition of ATP synthase is not related to aspirin's mechanism of action.",9
7951,"The patient presents with irregular menstrual cycles, galactorrhea (milk-like nipple discharge), fatigue, muscle and joint pain, weight gain, and elevated prolactin levels. She also has a history of hypothyroidism and has not been taking her levothyroxine. Her TSH level is elevated, indicating untreated hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism can lead to elevated TRH (thyrotropin-releasing hormone), which can stimulate prolactin release from the pituitary gland, causing hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea. The elevated prolactin level (88 ng/mL) is consistent with this mechanism. Other options like thyrotropic pituitary adenoma, ectopic prolactin production, and Cushing disease are less likely given the clinical context and lab findings.",9
7953,"The clinical presentation of this 6-year-old boy is suggestive of intussusception, characterized by intermittent abdominal pain, vomiting, and the ultrasound finding of concentric rings (""target sign""). Intussusception is common in young children and often occurs when a segment of the intestine telescopes into an adjacent segment. The most common underlying cause of intussusception in children is a lead point, which can be due to various conditions. In children, a Meckel diverticulum is a common lead point for intussusception. The history of recurrent episodes and the age of the patient also support this diagnosis. Other options like malrotation with volvulus, intestinal polyps, and intestinal adhesions are less common causes of intussusception in this age group.",9
7958,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with Dupuytren's contracture, which is characterized by progressive fibrosis of the palmar fascia leading to flexion contractures of the fingers, most commonly the 4th and 5th digits. The presence of palmar nodules and skin puckering supports this diagnosis. The condition is more common in individuals with a family history, diabetes, and those who smoke or consume alcohol. The underlying mechanism is palmar fibromatosis, which involves the thickening and shortening of the palmar fascia.",9
5917,"The patient presents with pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia, and a swollen lower extremity following recent surgery and long travel, which raises suspicion for a pulmonary embolism (PE). The presence of hemoptysis in this context is particularly concerning for PE, as it can indicate pulmonary infarction due to embolism. While other findings like decreased breath sounds or wheezing could be associated with other conditions, hemoptysis is more directly linked to PE and would warrant further investigation with a CT angiogram to confirm the diagnosis.",9
7966,"The patient is at 32 weeks' gestation and has an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 5 cm, which indicates oligohydramnios (low amniotic fluid). Oligohydramnios can lead to several complications, one of which is pulmonary hypoplasia. This condition occurs because the fetus requires adequate amniotic fluid to practice breathing movements, which are essential for lung development. The calcifications of the placenta and the patient's diabetes might contribute to placental insufficiency, further reducing amniotic fluid. Other options like renal dysplasia could cause oligohydramnios, but the question asks for the condition the child is at greatest risk of developing, which is pulmonary hypoplasia due to the direct consequence of oligohydramnios.",9
5921,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The key findings include the presence of myeloblasts with splinter-shaped structures (Auer rods) and the initiation of treatment with a vitamin A derivative, which is all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). APL is specifically associated with the t(15;17) chromosomal translocation, which results in the fusion of the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene on chromosome 15 and the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) gene on chromosome 17. This translocation is pathognomonic for APL and explains the use of ATRA in treatment, as it targets the RARA component of the fusion protein.",10
7970,"On the first postoperative day, fever is common and often due to non-infectious causes. The most likely cause of fever on the first day after surgery is the inflammatory response to the surgical procedure itself. This is often referred to as ""postoperative fever"" and is usually benign. Abscess formation and wound infection are unlikely to develop so quickly after surgery. A urinary tract infection could occur, especially if a catheter was used, but it is less common on the first day. The presence of mild crackles suggests atelectasis, which is also a common cause of early postoperative fever due to immobility and shallow breathing. However, the question asks for the most likely etiology, which is the inflammatory response to surgery.",9
5926,"The patient is a 17-year-old girl who has not yet experienced menarche, which is concerning for primary amenorrhea. She has normal breast development and pubic hair, indicating that she has undergone some degree of pubertal development. The presence of headaches, particularly with the description provided, could suggest a neurological issue, but they are also consistent with migraines, which are common in this age group. Her blood pressure is elevated, which could be a sign of an underlying condition. 

Given her age and the fact that she has not had menarche, it is important to evaluate for anatomical abnormalities that could cause primary amenorrhea. A pelvic ultrasound would help assess for the presence of a uterus and any structural abnormalities such as Mullerian agenesis or an imperforate hymen. 

While an MRI of the head could be considered if there were more neurological symptoms or signs of a pituitary issue, the primary concern here is the lack of menarche. Serum estradiol and testosterone levels could be useful in evaluating hormonal causes of amenorrhea, but the immediate step should be to rule out anatomical causes.

Therefore, the best next step in management is a pelvic ultrasound to evaluate for structural causes of primary amenorrhea.",9
5931,"The clinical presentation suggests a brachial plexus injury, specifically an upper trunk injury. The symptoms include weakness in abduction, lateral rotation, flexion, and supination of the left arm, which are functions primarily associated with the C5-C6 nerve roots. The description of the arm hanging by the torso and the hand being 'bent backwards and facing the sky' is characteristic of Erb-Duchenne palsy, which results from injury to the C5-C6 nerve roots. This type of injury often occurs due to trauma that causes excessive separation between the head and shoulder, such as being tackled in football.",9
7982,"The newborn is preterm at 30 weeks' gestation and has developed respiratory distress shortly after birth. The symptoms include tachypnea, grunting, subcostal retractions, and decreased breath sounds bilaterally. The oxygen saturation remains low despite supplemental oxygen. These findings are characteristic of Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS), which is common in preterm infants due to surfactant deficiency. The other options are less likely: Tracheomalacia typically presents with stridor and is not immediately after birth; Neonatal pneumonia could present similarly but is less common immediately after birth without risk factors; Tracheoesophageal fistula would present with feeding difficulties and aspiration.",9
7990,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of myasthenia gravis, including weakness, fatigue, and ptosis, which worsen with activity and improve with rest. The acute presentation with respiratory distress (shallow breathing, cyanosis, and tachypnea) indicates a myasthenic crisis, which is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate intervention. In a myasthenic crisis, the priority is to secure the airway and ensure adequate ventilation. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is endotracheal intubation to protect the airway and support breathing.",9
5952,"The patient's history of long-standing lichen sclerosus and the presence of an ulcerated nodule on the vulva are key factors in this case. Lichen sclerosus is a known risk factor for the development of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma. The description of the nodule as ulcerated and the presence of chronic vulvar itching that has worsened over time further support the suspicion of malignancy. Bartholin gland cysts and carcinomas typically present differently, and Vulvar Paget's disease usually presents with eczematous lesions rather than ulcerated nodules. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is squamous cell carcinoma.",9
8000,"The patient's symptoms of difficulty swallowing both solids and liquids without pain, along with his South American origin, suggest a condition affecting esophageal motility. The barium swallow study and esophageal manometry are key diagnostic tools for esophageal motility disorders. In this context, the most likely condition is achalasia, which is characterized by the failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax and the absence of normal esophageal peristalsis. Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is a common cause of secondary achalasia in individuals from South America. The other options are less likely: squamous cell carcinoma typically presents with progressive dysphagia and weight loss; GERD is associated with heartburn and regurgitation; and a pharyngoesophageal diverticulum (Zenker's diverticulum) usually causes dysphagia with regurgitation of undigested food and halitosis.",9
5955,"The patient's presentation is consistent with Marfan syndrome. The key features include being tall and thin with long extremities and arachnodactyly (spider-like fingers). Additionally, cystic medial necrosis of the aorta is a common cardiovascular manifestation of Marfan syndrome. The other options do not match the clinical presentation: Fabry disease involves angiokeratomas and renal issues, Tay-Sachs disease is a neurodegenerative disorder, and Von Hippel-Lindau disease involves tumors and cysts in various organs.",9

5961,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of a rapidly growing breast mass. The mass is smooth, multinodular, firm, mobile, and painless, which are characteristics that can be seen in both fibroadenomas and phyllodes tumors. However, the rapid growth over a short period (from 5 cm to 8 cm in 6 weeks) is more characteristic of a phyllodes tumor than a fibroadenoma, which typically grows more slowly. The ultrasound findings of a well-circumscribed hypoechoic mass with cystic components also align with a phyllodes tumor. Fibroadenomas are usually smaller and grow more slowly. A breast abscess would likely present with signs of infection such as pain, redness, and possibly fever, which are absent here. Fat necrosis typically follows trauma and presents with a firm, irregular mass, often with skin changes, which are not described in this case. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis confirmed by the core needle biopsy is a phyllodes tumor.",9
8018,"The clinical presentation of the child, including intellectual disability, a long thin face with a large jaw, protruding ears, and macroorchidism, is characteristic of Fragile X syndrome. This condition is caused by an expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat on the FMR1 gene located on the X chromosome. The high-pitched holosystolic murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla is likely a mitral valve prolapse, which can be associated with Fragile X syndrome. Therefore, the trinucleotide repeat most likely affected in this individual is CGG on the sex chromosome X.",9
5973,"The patient is experiencing an anaphylactic reaction to a bee sting, as evidenced by the rapid onset of symptoms such as breathlessness, pruritic rashes, and wheezing. Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that requires immediate treatment. The first-line treatment for anaphylaxis is intramuscular epinephrine, which can quickly reverse the symptoms by causing vasoconstriction, bronchodilation, and reducing vascular permeability. While antihistamines like diphenhydramine and corticosteroids like methylprednisolone can be used as adjunctive treatments, they are not effective as immediate treatments for anaphylaxis. Therefore, the best course of action is to administer epinephrine immediately and then proceed to the emergency department for further evaluation and management.",10
5975,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of a pneumothorax, likely a spontaneous pneumothorax given his age and sudden onset of symptoms after exercise. The hyperresonance and diminished breath sounds on the right side, along with asymmetrical chest wall motion, support this diagnosis. In cases of pneumothorax, especially if it is large or causing significant symptoms, the immediate management is to relieve the pressure in the pleural space. This is typically done by inserting a chest tube (thoracostomy) to allow the air to escape and the lung to re-expand. While imaging like a chest X-ray can confirm the diagnosis, the clinical presentation is often sufficient to proceed with treatment in an emergency setting. Therefore, the best step in management is tube insertion.",9
5985,"The patient's symptoms and history are suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), especially given the chronic cough, night sweats, weight loss, and hemoptysis. The chest X-ray showing a right upper lobe density further supports this suspicion, as TB commonly affects the upper lobes of the lungs. To confirm active TB infection, a test that directly identifies the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the sputum is needed. The Ziehl-Neelsen stain is used to identify acid-fast bacilli, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, in sputum samples. This test would be most helpful in making a definitive diagnosis of active TB infection.",9
8038,"The patient is a young woman with a low body weight (BMI ~16.8), bradycardia, hypotension, hypothermia, and dry skin and mucous membranes. These findings are suggestive of a condition that involves malnutrition or an eating disorder. Her irritability and refusal to answer questions, along with her training for a marathon, might indicate a focus on body image and exercise. The presence of a systolic murmur could be related to mitral valve prolapse, which is sometimes seen in individuals with anorexia nervosa due to changes in cardiac structure from malnutrition. The hemoglobin level is slightly low, which could also be consistent with nutritional deficiencies. These findings collectively point towards anorexia nervosa as the most likely diagnosis.",9
5992,"The patient has congestive heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (35%). The symptoms of mild dyspnea on exertion and swollen ankles suggest worsening heart failure. The cardiologist likely added a medication to improve cardiac function. The symptom of seeing yellow halos is a classic side effect of digoxin, which is used to increase cardiac contractility and control heart rate in heart failure. Hydralazine, dobutamine, and nitroprusside do not typically cause visual disturbances like yellow halos. Therefore, the medication most likely added is digoxin.",9
8041,"When a macrophage is activated by the recognition of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and by interferon-γ (IFN-γ), it becomes a key player in the immune response. Activated macrophages secrete various cytokines that help orchestrate the immune response. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is one of the cytokines secreted by activated macrophages. IL-12 plays a crucial role in promoting the differentiation of naive T cells into Th1 cells, which are important for the cell-mediated immune response against intracellular pathogens. IL-12 also enhances the production of IFN-γ by natural killer (NK) cells and T cells, further activating macrophages and promoting a Th1 response. The other options, such as IL-1RA, IL-4, and IL-10, are not typically secreted by macrophages in response to LPS and IFN-γ activation. IL-1RA is an antagonist that inhibits IL-1 activity, IL-4 is associated with Th2 responses, and IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that downregulates immune responses.",9
5997,"The symptoms described in the nephew, including seizures, failure to thrive, neurodegeneration, and sparse, brittle hair, are characteristic of Menkes disease. Menkes disease is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7A gene, which affects copper transport. In X-linked recessive disorders, males are affected if they inherit the mutated gene from their carrier mothers, while females are typically carriers unless they inherit two copies of the mutated gene, which is rare. 

In this scenario, the patient's sister is likely a carrier of the X-linked recessive gene, and her son (the nephew) inherited the affected X chromosome from her, resulting in the disease. The patient's sister's husband is not affected, which is consistent with the X-linked recessive pattern, as males only need one copy of the mutated gene to be affected.

For the patient herself, there is a 50% chance she is a carrier if her mother was a carrier (since her sister is a carrier). If she is a carrier and has a son, there is a 50% chance she would pass the affected X chromosome to him, resulting in the son having the disorder. However, without knowing if she is a carrier, the probability that her son would have the disorder is 50% (chance she is a carrier) multiplied by 50% (chance she passes the affected X chromosome to her son), which equals 25%.",9
6004,"The patient initially presented with signs of an acute myocardial infarction (MI), as indicated by the chest pain, ECG changes (Q waves and ST elevation in V2-V5), and elevated cardiac enzymes. She was treated and initially showed signs of recovery. However, on the 6th day, she developed new symptoms including vomiting, dizziness, hypotension (BP 90/60 mm Hg), and a harsh pansystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. These findings are suggestive of a mechanical complication following an MI.

The pansystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border is characteristic of a ventricular septal rupture, which can occur as a complication of an MI. This condition leads to a left-to-right shunt, causing volume overload and heart failure, which explains the hypotension and elevated jugular venous pressure. The timing (6 days post-MI) is also consistent with the occurrence of a ventricular septal rupture.

Acute pericarditis would typically present with a pericardial friction rub and diffuse ST elevation, not a pansystolic murmur. A new MI would likely show new ST changes and a rise in cardiac enzymes, which is not the case here. Aortic dissection would present with different symptoms, such as tearing chest pain radiating to the back, and is not associated with a pansystolic murmur.

Therefore, the clinical picture is most consistent with an acute ventricular septal rupture complicating the myocardial infarction.",9
6005,"The patient's presentation is consistent with Parkinson's disease, characterized by a resting tremor that improves with movement, mild rigidity, and normal reflexes. The tremor frequency of 4-5 Hz and improvement with movement further support this diagnosis. In Parkinson's disease, anticholinergic medications can be used to help control tremor, especially in younger patients or those with tremor as a predominant symptom. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are used for cognitive symptoms in conditions like Alzheimer's disease, not for tremor. Beta-blockers are typically used for essential tremor, which is an action tremor, not a resting tremor. Sodium channel antagonists are not relevant to this scenario. Therefore, the appropriate class of medication for this patient's resting tremor in the context of Parkinson's disease is an anticholinergic.",9
8054,"The patient has decreased activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which is crucial for converting pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, linking glycolysis to the citric acid cycle. In pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, pyruvate is shunted to lactate, causing lactic acidosis. Treatment often involves a ketogenic diet, which provides energy through ketone bodies rather than glucose, reducing lactate production. Lysine and leucine are purely ketogenic amino acids, meaning they do not increase pyruvate levels and are beneficial in this condition. Valine, however, is a glucogenic amino acid, which can increase pyruvate levels and exacerbate lactic acidosis. Therefore, supplementation with valine should be avoided.",9
6009,"The patient presents with fatigue, black sticky stools (melena), and laboratory findings suggestive of anemia and renal failure. The history of polycystic kidney disease and elevated creatinine indicates chronic kidney disease (CKD). The anemia is likely due to chronic disease and possibly gastrointestinal bleeding. The presence of a flapping tremor (asterixis) and excoriations suggests uremic symptoms, which are common in advanced CKD. In CKD, there is impaired production of thrombopoietin, leading to thrombocytopenia, and dysfunctional platelet aggregation due to uremic toxins. The low platelet count and bleeding tendency are consistent with dysfunctional platelet aggregation rather than a deficiency in clotting factors or thrombopoietin production. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of the patient's condition is dysfunctional platelet aggregation due to uremia.",9
8071,"The patient presents with bleeding symptoms such as gum bleeding, oozing from surgical sites, and epistaxis. The lab results show prolonged PT and aPTT, but normal platelet count and D-dimer levels. This suggests a coagulopathy rather than a platelet disorder or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The normal D-dimer and platelet count make DIC unlikely. The prolonged PT and aPTT with normal platelet count and D-dimer suggest a deficiency in clotting factors, which can be caused by vitamin K deficiency. This is consistent with the patient's malnourished state (BMI of 16 kg/m^2) and history of alcohol abuse, which can lead to vitamin K deficiency. Antibiotic therapy, particularly with broad-spectrum antibiotics like vancomycin and gentamicin, can exacerbate vitamin K deficiency by affecting gut flora that produce vitamin K. Therefore, the most likely cause of the bleeding is antibiotic therapy leading to vitamin K deficiency.",9
8076,"In assessing the strongest risk factor for suicide in this patient, we consider several elements. A family history of completed suicide, such as the patient's mother, is a significant risk factor for suicide. Attempted drug overdose is also a strong risk factor, as previous suicide attempts are one of the most powerful predictors of future attempts. Use of medical marijuana is a less direct risk factor compared to the others. Lack of social support can contribute to risk but is not as direct as a previous suicide attempt. Among these, the strongest risk factor is the attempted drug overdose, as it indicates a recent and direct action towards suicide.",9
6029,"Etoposide is a chemotherapeutic agent that works by inhibiting the enzyme topoisomerase II. This enzyme is responsible for managing DNA supercoiling and untangling during replication and transcription. By inhibiting topoisomerase II, etoposide prevents the relaxation of supercoiled DNA, leading to DNA strand breaks and ultimately cell death. This mechanism is distinct from alkylation, crosslinking, or microtubule stabilization, which are mechanisms of other chemotherapeutic agents.",9
8077,"The patient's symptoms suggest hypothyroidism, likely following a subacute thyroiditis. The history of a flu-like illness followed by neck pain and symptoms of hypothyroidism is characteristic of subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (de Quervain's thyroiditis). This condition is typically preceded by a viral infection and presents with a painful, tender thyroid gland. On biopsy, subacute granulomatous thyroiditis is characterized by granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells.",9
8080,"The key finding in this case is the sagging of the left pelvis when the child stands on his right leg. This is indicative of a positive Trendelenburg sign, which occurs when there is weakness of the hip abductors, primarily the gluteus medius and minimus muscles. These muscles are innervated by the superior gluteal nerve. Damage to the right superior gluteal nerve would result in weakness of the right hip abductors, causing the left pelvis to sag when standing on the right leg. 

L5 radiculopathy could cause weakness in the hip abductors, but it would typically present with additional symptoms such as back pain or sensory changes, which are not mentioned here. A spinal abscess would likely present with systemic symptoms and neurological deficits, which are not present in this case. Damage to the right common peroneal nerve would affect dorsiflexion and eversion of the foot, not the hip abductors.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the findings is damage to the right superior gluteal nerve.",9

6046,"The patient's occupation as a poultry worker and the symptoms suggest an infection with Chlamydophila psittaci, which causes psittacosis. This pathogen is known for causing atypical pneumonia and is associated with exposure to birds. The treatment with cephalexin, a beta-lactam antibiotic, is not typically effective against atypical pathogens like Chlamydophila, which explains the modest improvement. Chlamydophila psittaci is an intracellular bacterium that primarily induces a Th1-cell response, as it requires cell-mediated immunity for clearance. This is characteristic of intracellular pathogens, which are typically targeted by Th1 responses.",9
8097,"Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency leads to emphysema due to unchecked activity of neutrophil elastase, which destroys elastin in the alveolar walls. This results in the destruction of alveolar walls and enlargement of airspaces, characteristic of emphysema. The cells primarily affected are the Type I pneumocytes, which line the alveoli and are involved in gas exchange. Their destruction leads to the airspace enlargement seen in emphysema.",9
8099,"The patient's symptoms of profuse, watery diarrhea following the consumption of shellfish suggest an infection with Vibrio cholerae. This bacterium is known to cause cholera, which is characterized by watery diarrhea. The mechanism by which Vibrio cholerae causes diarrhea is through the production of cholera toxin. This toxin ADP-ribosylates the Gs protein, leading to the activation of adenylate cyclase. This results in increased levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) within intestinal epithelial cells, causing the secretion of chloride ions into the intestinal lumen and subsequent osmotic movement of water, leading to watery diarrhea. Therefore, the mechanism most likely responsible for this patient's illness is ADP-ribosylation of the Gs protein.",9
6057,"During pregnancy, the hormone responsible for maintaining progesterone levels is human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). hCG shares a similar alpha subunit with other glycoprotein hormones such as luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Among these, TSH acts on the thyroid gland. Therefore, the circulating factor responsible for maintaining progesterone levels during pregnancy is hCG, which has a similar structure to TSH, particularly in its alpha subunit. This similarity would be identified on a western blot as having a band identical to TSH, which acts on the thyroid gland.",9
8105,"The patient is a 39-year-old woman with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) characterized by frequent, heavy bleeding with clots. Her BMI is 34 kg/m2, indicating obesity, which is a risk factor for endometrial hyperplasia and cancer due to increased estrogen levels. Her mother’s history of ovarian cancer also raises concern for potential hereditary cancer syndromes. Given her age, obesity, and family history, it is important to rule out endometrial pathology, such as hyperplasia or cancer. An endometrial biopsy is a minimally invasive procedure that can provide a definitive diagnosis of endometrial conditions. Other options like endometrial ablation or diagnostic laparoscopy are not appropriate initial steps for evaluating AUB in this context. Abdominal ultrasonography is less specific for endometrial pathology compared to a biopsy. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is an endometrial biopsy.",9
6063,"The child presents with fatigue, shortness of breath, and a holosystolic murmur with a thrill along the left sternal border. These symptoms and findings are suggestive of a cardiac defect. A holosystolic murmur along the left sternal border is characteristic of a ventricular septal defect (VSD). In VSD, blood flows from the left ventricle to the right ventricle during systole, causing the murmur. The thrill indicates a significant shunt. Tetralogy of Fallot typically presents with cyanosis and a different type of murmur. Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) presents with a continuous ""machinery"" murmur, not a holosystolic murmur. An atrial septal defect (ASD) usually presents with a fixed split S2 and a systolic ejection murmur, not a holosystolic murmur. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a ventricular septal defect (VSD).",9
8112,"The patient has a family history of various cancers and genetic testing shows mutations in the MLH1 and MSH2 genes, which are associated with Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, HNPCC). Lynch syndrome increases the risk of several types of cancer, including colorectal, endometrial, ovarian, gastric, and others. Given the increased risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer in women with Lynch syndrome, prophylactic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy are often recommended to reduce the risk of these cancers. The other options are not typically associated with Lynch syndrome management: Celecoxib or sulindac therapy is more related to familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), bilateral prophylactic mastectomy is associated with BRCA mutations, and prophylactic proctocolectomy is also more related to FAP.",9
8134,"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of stable angina, likely due to coronary artery disease, given his risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, and family history of early myocardial infarction). The exercise stress test shows ST-segment depressions, indicating ischemia. The goal of long-term pharmacotherapy in stable angina is to reduce the frequency of anginal episodes and improve exercise tolerance. Beta-blockers, such as metoprolol, are first-line therapy for stable angina as they reduce myocardial oxygen demand by decreasing heart rate and contractility. Isosorbide mononitrate is also used for angina but is typically considered when beta-blockers are contraindicated or insufficient. Aspirin and clopidogrel are antiplatelet agents used to prevent thrombotic events but do not directly reduce angina frequency.",9
8143,"The patient's symptoms are suggestive of serotonin syndrome, which is characterized by a triad of autonomic instability (e.g., hyperthermia, hypertension, tachycardia), neuromuscular abnormalities (e.g., hyperreflexia, tremor, ataxia), and altered mental status (e.g., confusion, anxiety). The history of major depressive disorder treated with fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), suggests that the addition of another serotonergic agent could precipitate serotonin syndrome. Sumatriptan, a medication used to treat migraines, is a serotonin receptor agonist and can contribute to serotonin syndrome when used in combination with SSRIs like fluoxetine. The other options (amiodarone, scopolamine, succinylcholine) do not have serotonergic activity and are unlikely to cause serotonin syndrome.",9
6097,"The patient's symptoms and physical findings are suggestive of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), particularly with the presence of skin thickening, Raynaud's phenomenon, and esophageal dysmotility. The pulmonary symptoms, including shortness of breath and fine inspiratory crackles, suggest interstitial lung disease, which is a common pulmonary manifestation of scleroderma. Interstitial lung disease is characterized by fibrosis of the lung interstitium, leading to decreased lung compliance and impaired gas exchange. This results in a decreased diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) due to thickening of the alveolar-capillary membrane. Therefore, the most likely additional finding in this patient is a decreased diffusing capacity.",9
6098,"The patient is presenting with symptoms and CSF findings suggestive of cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS and low CD4 counts. The elevated opening pressure on lumbar puncture indicates increased intracranial pressure (ICP), which is a common complication of cryptococcal meningitis. While amphotericin B and flucytosine are appropriate antifungal treatments, managing the elevated ICP is crucial to prevent complications such as herniation. Serial lumbar punctures are often performed to relieve elevated ICP in cryptococcal meningitis by reducing CSF pressure. Other options like mannitol and acetazolamide are not typically used in this context. Therefore, the additional treatment warranted in this acute setting is serial lumbar punctures to manage the elevated ICP.",9
6099,"The child's symptoms include social difficulties, such as being a lonely kid without many friends and not making eye contact. He has repetitive behaviors, such as collecting and organizing rocks, and making random noises. His speech is normal in grammar and vocabulary but lacks social awareness, as he cannot tell the physician is not interested in his rock collection. These symptoms align with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), which is characterized by social communication challenges and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior. The child's artistic ability and detailed recreation of cartoon characters also fit with ASD, where individuals may have specific areas of interest or talent. ADHD is characterized by inattention and hyperactivity, which doesn't fully explain the social and repetitive behavior issues. Tourette’s syndrome involves motor and vocal tics, but the social and repetitive behavior aspects are more indicative of ASD. OCD involves obsessions and compulsions, but the social communication issues are not typical of OCD.",9
6103,"The clinical presentation suggests Turner syndrome, characterized by features such as short stature, high-arched palate, low posterior hairline, broad chest with widely spaced nipples, and hypertension. Turner syndrome is associated with gonadal dysgenesis, leading to estrogen deficiency, which increases the risk of osteoporosis due to lack of estrogen's protective effects on bone density. Therefore, without appropriate treatment, such as estrogen replacement therapy, the patient is at the greatest risk of developing osteoporosis.",9
8152,"The clinical presentation and imaging findings are suggestive of a posterior fossa tumor, which is common in children. The symptoms of recurrent vomiting, difficulty walking, and bilateral optic disc swelling indicate increased intracranial pressure and cerebellar involvement. The broad-based gait suggests cerebellar dysfunction. In children, medulloblastoma is a common tumor located in the cerebellum, often causing these symptoms. Glioblastoma multiforme is more common in adults, oligodendroglioma typically presents with seizures and is rare in children, and pinealoma would present with different symptoms related to the pineal gland. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is medulloblastoma.",9
8153,"The patient's symptoms and CT findings are indicative of a subdural hematoma, likely chronic given the time course and the crescentic shape on CT. The neurological deficits, including altered mental status and focal findings such as hyperreflexia and Babinski's sign, suggest significant mass effect or brain compression. In an elderly patient with these symptoms and a significant hematoma size (15 mm), surgical evacuation is typically indicated to relieve pressure and prevent further deterioration.",9
8154,"In many jurisdictions, minors are allowed to consent to treatment for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) without parental consent. This is to encourage minors to seek necessary medical care without fear of parental involvement. Therefore, the physician should respect the patient's request not to contact her parents. However, Chlamydial infection is a reportable disease, meaning that it must be reported to public health agencies for tracking and control purposes. This reporting is done without disclosing the patient's identity to the public or to her parents. Thus, the physician should not contact her parents but must report the infection to public health agencies.",9
6109,"The patient is experiencing difficulty differentiating red from green, which is a known side effect of ethambutol, one of the drugs used in the initial phase of anti-tubercular therapy. Ethambutol is associated with optic neuritis, which can lead to color vision abnormalities, particularly red-green color blindness. Ethambutol works by inhibiting the enzyme arabinosyltransferase, which is involved in the synthesis of the mycobacterial cell wall. This inhibition disrupts the polymerization of arabinogalactan, an essential component of the mycobacterial cell wall, thereby exerting its anti-mycobacterial effects.",9
8158,"The patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest an ischemic stroke in the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory. The MCA supplies the lateral convexity of the cerebral hemisphere, which includes areas responsible for motor and sensory functions of the face and upper extremity, as well as language and visual processing areas. The symptoms of left-sided weakness, decreased sensation, and facial drooping indicate involvement of the right MCA, affecting the left side of the body. Conjugate eye deviation to the right is also consistent with a right MCA stroke. 

Homonymous hemianopsia is a common visual field defect associated with MCA strokes, particularly when the stroke affects the optic radiations or visual cortex. In this case, a right MCA stroke would cause left homonymous hemianopsia, meaning loss of the left visual field in both eyes. 

Amaurosis fugax is related to transient monocular vision loss, often due to carotid artery disease, and is not directly related to MCA strokes. Profound lower limb weakness is more characteristic of anterior cerebral artery strokes. Prosopagnosia, or face blindness, is associated with lesions in the fusiform gyrus, typically in the temporal lobe, and is not a common finding in MCA strokes.

Therefore, the most likely additional finding in this patient would be homonymous hemianopsia.",9
8162,"The patient is presenting with acute decompensated heart failure, likely pulmonary edema, as evidenced by shortness of breath, bilateral crackles, jugular venous distension, and pitting edema. The chest X-ray findings of prominent interstitial markings and alveolar infiltrates support this. In such cases, rapid relief of symptoms is often achieved with diuretics, specifically loop diuretics, which help reduce fluid overload by promoting diuresis. Loop diuretics work by blocking the Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, leading to increased excretion of sodium, chloride, and water, thereby reducing preload and relieving pulmonary congestion.",9
8164,"The patient's symptoms of loss of horizontal gaze with intact convergence and nystagmus are indicative of internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO). INO is commonly associated with multiple sclerosis and is due to a lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF). The MLF is responsible for coordinating eye movements, particularly horizontal gaze. In INO, there is a failure of adduction of the eye on the side of the lesion during horizontal gaze, while convergence remains intact because it is controlled by a different pathway. The presence of nystagmus in the abducting eye is also characteristic. Therefore, the most likely etiology for her eye examination findings is a loss of the bilateral medial longitudinal fasciculus.",9
6133,,0
6135,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest nephrotic syndrome, characterized by significant proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. The renal biopsy showing apple-green birefringence under polarized light with Congo red stain indicates amyloidosis. In the context of amyloidosis, particularly AL (primary) amyloidosis, there is often an association with plasma cell dyscrasias such as multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is characterized by the production of abnormal monoclonal proteins, which can lead to rouleaux formation on a peripheral blood smear due to increased serum protein levels. Therefore, the most likely finding in further evaluation would be rouleaux formation on the peripheral smear, which is associated with the presence of high levels of circulating monoclonal proteins.",9
8184,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest Lyme disease, particularly given her recent camping trip in Vermont, a region endemic for Lyme disease. The bradycardia (pulse of 47/min) and the history of flu-like symptoms are consistent with Lyme carditis, which can cause heart block. The two-step serological testing confirming the diagnosis further supports Lyme disease. In cases of Lyme carditis with significant heart block, intravenous ceftriaxone is the appropriate treatment to address the infection and potentially improve the heart block. Oral antibiotics like doxycycline or amoxicillin are used for less severe Lyme disease presentations, and a permanent pacemaker is not indicated unless the heart block does not resolve with antibiotic therapy.",9
6139,"The clinical presentation of the 5-year-old boy includes developmental delay, poor eye contact, a prominent jaw, a single palmar crease, and bilaterally enlarged testicles. These findings are characteristic of Fragile X syndrome. Fragile X syndrome is caused by a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome. The presence of a prominent jaw and macroorchidism (enlarged testicles) are particularly indicative of this condition. The other options do not match the clinical presentation: CTG repeat expansion is associated with myotonic dystrophy, microdeletion of chromosome 5 is associated with Cri-du-chat syndrome, and microdeletion of chromosome 7 is associated with Williams syndrome.",9
6140,"The patient presents with significant weight loss, a very low BMI, bradycardia, hypothermia, and lanugo, which are indicative of anorexia nervosa. Her refusal to eat with the family, obsession with food preparation, and distorted body image further support this diagnosis. The most immediate concern is her medical instability, as evidenced by her low heart rate and hypothermia, which are signs of severe malnutrition and potential cardiovascular compromise. In such cases, the priority is to stabilize the patient medically. Therefore, inpatient nutritional rehabilitation is necessary to address her malnutrition and monitor her vital signs closely. Outpatient management or psychotherapy would not be appropriate given her current medical instability.",9
7168,"The patient's endoscopy findings of salmon pink mucosa extending proximal to the gastroesophageal junction, along with biopsy showing nonciliated columnar epithelium with goblet cells, are indicative of Barrett's esophagus. Barrett's esophagus is a condition where the normal squamous epithelium of the esophagus is replaced by columnar epithelium due to chronic injury. The most common cause of this metaplasia is chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), where the esophagus is exposed to gastric acid. This chronic acid exposure leads to the transformation of the esophageal lining to a columnar type, which is more resistant to acid. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is esophageal exposure to gastric acid.",9
5650,"In the context of myocardial infarction, different cardiac enzymes have different time courses for elevation and normalization. Troponin I is a highly sensitive and specific marker for myocardial injury, and it remains elevated for 7-10 days after an acute myocardial infarction, making it less useful for detecting reinfarction shortly after the initial event. Creatine kinase (CK)-MB, on the other hand, rises within 4-6 hours, peaks at 18-24 hours, and returns to baseline within 48-72 hours. This makes CK-MB particularly useful for detecting reinfarction, as it would have returned to baseline by 56 hours post-angioplasty, allowing for detection of a new rise in enzyme levels. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is less specific and takes longer to rise and fall, while CK-MM is not specific to cardiac muscle. Therefore, CK-MB is the most appropriate enzyme to assess for reinfarction in this patient.",9
7698,"The patient's symptoms and recent travel history are key to identifying the causative agent. He presents with watery diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps, which are common symptoms of viral gastroenteritis. The fact that he recently returned from a cruise is a significant clue. Norovirus is well-known for causing outbreaks of gastroenteritis in closed or semi-closed communities, such as cruise ships, due to its high infectivity and ability to spread rapidly in such environments. Rotavirus typically affects young children and is less common in adults, especially in developed countries where vaccination is prevalent. Staphylococcus aureus typically causes food poisoning with rapid onset of symptoms, usually within a few hours after ingestion, and is associated with preformed toxins in food. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a common cause of traveler's diarrhea, but it is more commonly associated with travel to developing countries and does not typically cause outbreaks on cruise ships. Given the setting and symptomatology, Norovirus is the most likely causative agent in this scenario.",9
7719,"The clinical presentation is suggestive of a fibroadenoma, which is a common benign breast tumor in young women. The key features include a mobile, well-circumscribed, firm mass that can vary in size with the menstrual cycle, often becoming tender or larger premenstrually and then reducing in size or tenderness afterward. The histological hallmark of a fibroadenoma is the presence of hypercellular stroma with overgrowth of both fibrous and glandular tissues. This corresponds to option B. Other options describe different breast pathologies: A describes fibrocystic changes, C describes ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and D describes normal breast tissue or possibly sclerosing adenosis. Therefore, the most likely histological finding for this patient's breast mass is option B.",9
7213,"Para-aminohippurate (PAH) is used to estimate renal plasma flow because it is both filtered and secreted by the renal tubules. At low plasma concentrations, PAH is efficiently secreted into the tubules, in addition to being filtered, leading to high excretion rates. However, the secretion of PAH is mediated by a carrier-mediated transport system in the proximal tubule, which can become saturated. When plasma PAH concentration increases beyond a certain point (in this case, greater than 20 mg/dL), the transport carriers become saturated, and the additional PAH cannot be secreted into the tubules as efficiently. This results in a decrease in the rate of increase of PAH excretion despite increasing plasma concentrations. Therefore, the decrease in PAH excretion with increasing plasma concentration beyond 20 mg/dL is best explained by the saturation of PAH transport carriers.",9
3139,"The Pringle maneuver is a surgical technique used to control bleeding from the liver by occluding the blood supply to the liver. This is achieved by clamping the hepatoduodenal ligament, which contains the portal triad: the hepatic artery, portal vein, and common bile duct. By clamping this ligament, blood flow through the hepatic artery and portal vein is temporarily stopped, reducing blood loss from the liver. This maneuver is particularly useful in cases of liver trauma or surgery where there is significant bleeding. The other options do not relate to the Pringle maneuver: the aorta above the coeliac axis (A) is not involved in this maneuver, the hepatic vein (B) is not clamped during the Pringle maneuver, and the splenic artery (D) is unrelated to the liver's blood supply. Therefore, the correct answer is C, the hepatoduodenal ligament.",9
4676,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings in this case are suggestive of Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO), which is associated with pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a. The key features include short stature, short 4th and 5th metacarpals, round face, dental abnormalities, and obesity. The laboratory findings show hypocalcemia with elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, indicating resistance to PTH, which is characteristic of pseudohypoparathyroidism. The elevated PTH with low calcium suggests end-organ resistance to PTH, rather than a deficiency of PTH itself.

Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a is caused by mutations in the GNAS gene, which encodes the alpha subunit of the stimulatory G protein (Gs alpha). This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with imprinting effects, meaning that the phenotype is expressed when the mutation is inherited from the mother due to imprinting of the paternal allele.

Therefore, the mode of inheritance for this condition is autosomal dominant.",9
6731,"The most effective method for smoking cessation typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and behavioral support. Quitting 'cold-turkey' (A) is often less effective due to the lack of support and high relapse rates. Bupropion alone (C) and nicotine replacement therapy alone (D) can be effective, but combining these methods with behavioral therapy increases success rates. Bupropion is an antidepressant that also helps reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, while nicotine replacement therapy helps manage withdrawal symptoms by providing a controlled dose of nicotine. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) provides psychological support and strategies to cope with cravings and triggers. Therefore, the combination of bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy, and CBT (B) is the most comprehensive and effective approach for smoking cessation.",9

1101,"The patient's symptoms are indicative of Parkinson's disease, which is characterized by bradykinesia (slow movements), rigidity (increased resistance to passive movement), resting tremor, and postural instability. The shuffling gait and small steps further support this diagnosis. Parkinson's disease is caused by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the brain, which is associated with the accumulation of misfolded α-synuclein protein, forming Lewy bodies. This aligns with option B, which describes neuronal degeneration due to α-synuclein protein misfolding. The other options do not match the clinical presentation: Option A describes Wilson's disease, which typically presents with liver disease and neurological symptoms, but not the specific parkinsonian features seen here. Option C would present with cerebellar symptoms such as ataxia, not the parkinsonian features. Option D describes hyperthyroidism, which would not cause these symptoms.",9
7178,"The situation describes a case-control study in which an odds ratio of 3.4 is calculated for the presence of MEN type 2 in patients experiencing surgical hypertension during pheochromocytoma resection. The odds ratio is a measure of association in a case-control study. A statistically significant odds ratio (p < 0.01) suggests that if there is no bias or confounding, there is an association between surgical hypertension and MEN type 2 syndromes. However, for the surgeon's conclusion regarding risk to be valid, the interpretation of the odds ratio as an estimate of relative risk requires an assumption that the condition being studied (surgical hypertension) is rare in the population. This allows the odds ratio to approximate the relative risk, which is what the conclusion implies -- that the risk is 3.4 times higher. Therefore, the key assumption here is that surgical hypertension associated with pheochromocytoma is a rare event.",9
5717,"The patient is a pregnant woman with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) who has not achieved adequate glycemic control with diet and lifestyle modifications. In such cases, pharmacotherapy is often required. The most commonly used medication for managing GDM is insulin, as it does not cross the placenta and is safe for the fetus. Insulin works by binding to insulin receptors, which are tyrosine kinase receptors, leading to increased glucose uptake by cells and lowering blood glucose levels. Therefore, the mechanism of action of insulin involves the binding of tyrosine kinase receptors.",9

611,"The newborn in this scenario presents with multiple congenital anomalies, including scalp lesions, cleft lip, micrognathia (small chin), rocker-bottom feet, a holosystolic murmur indicative of a congenital heart defect, omphalocele, and significant brain abnormalities (holoprosencephaly). These findings are suggestive of a chromosomal disorder. The combination of these features, particularly the holoprosencephaly, cleft lip, and omphalocele, is characteristic of Patau syndrome (Trisomy 13). Patau syndrome is also associated with polydactyly, which is an additional finding that fits this syndrome. The other options, such as webbed neck, single palmar crease, and hypoplastic philtrum, are more commonly associated with other syndromes like Turner syndrome, Down syndrome, and fetal alcohol syndrome, respectively. Therefore, the most likely additional finding in this patient with Patau syndrome is polydactyly.",9
6743,"The patient's symptoms and clinical findings are suggestive of acute cholecystitis. She presents with right upper quadrant pain that worsens after eating, fever, and a positive Murphy's sign (sudden inspiratory arrest during right upper quadrant palpation). The leukocytosis further supports an inflammatory process. The normal liver function tests and absence of jaundice make choledocholithiasis (common bile duct stone) less likely, as this would typically cause elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels. Acute pancreatitis is unlikely given the normal amylase levels and lack of characteristic symptoms. Emphysematous cholecystitis (gas in the gallbladder wall) is a rare condition and would typically present with more severe symptoms and systemic signs. The most common finding in acute cholecystitis is a gallstone obstructing the cystic duct, leading to gallbladder inflammation. Therefore, imaging is most likely to show a gallstone in the cystic duct.",9
7249,"The patient in this scenario presents with symptoms consistent with mild intermittent asthma. He experiences shortness of breath and cough twice a week and nocturnal symptoms twice a month. His spirometry results show an FEV1 of 81% of predicted, and an FEV1:FVC ratio of 0.85, which are within normal limits, suggesting that his lung function is not significantly impaired. According to asthma management guidelines, mild intermittent asthma is typically managed with a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) as needed, often in combination with a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) for quick relief. Option A, budesonide and formoterol inhaler, provides both an ICS and a LABA, making it suitable for initial management in this case. Options B, C, and D involve either only an ICS, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, or a combination that is not typically used for initial therapy in mild intermittent asthma. Therefore, the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy is option A.",9
105,"The clinical presentation described in the question is characteristic of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a prion disease. The key features include rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus (sudden jerking movements), and gait disturbances, leading to death within a year. On autopsy, the brain of a patient with CJD typically shows spongiform changes, which are characterized by vacuolation of the neuropil, neuronal loss, and gliosis. These changes give the brain a spongy appearance under the microscope. Therefore, the most likely finding on autopsy in this case would be spongiform changes in the brain tissue.",9
7797,"The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of cardiac tamponade, which include hypotension, tachycardia, jugular venous distention, muffled heart sounds, and pulsus paradoxus (radial pulse becoming weak with inspiration). The echocardiogram findings of ventricular diastolic collapse and reciprocal respiratory ventricular inflow further support the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade. In this condition, the heart is compressed by fluid in the pericardial space, leading to impaired cardiac filling and reduced cardiac output. The most immediate and effective treatment for cardiac tamponade is to relieve the pressure on the heart by draining the pericardial fluid. Therefore, the best next step in management is pericardial drainage.",9

7799,"The clinical presentation of this 75-year-old woman is highly suggestive of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). She has symptoms of fatigue, fever, pain in the shoulders and hips, weight loss, and morning stiffness lasting about an hour. These symptoms, along with her age and elevated inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP), align with PMR. PMR is characterized by pain and stiffness in the shoulder and hip girdles, particularly in the morning, and is common in older adults. The most appropriate next step in management for suspected PMR is to start a low-dose oral corticosteroid, such as prednisone, which typically results in a rapid and dramatic improvement of symptoms. Muscle biopsy and electromyography are not indicated as PMR does not involve muscle weakness or muscle pathology that would require these tests. Antibody screening is not relevant here as PMR is not associated with specific autoantibodies.",9
5761,"The patient presents with symptoms of night sweats, cough, and fever, which are suggestive of a pulmonary infection. His history of non-compliance with HAART therapy for HIV increases his risk for opportunistic infections. The chest radiograph shows a cavity in the right upper lobe, which is a classic finding for reactivation tuberculosis (TB). Mycobacterium tuberculosis is known to cause cavitary lesions in the upper lobes of the lungs, especially in immunocompromised individuals such as those with poorly controlled HIV. 

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) typically causes disseminated disease in AIDS patients with very low CD4 counts and is less likely to cause cavitary lung lesions. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can cause pulmonary infections in immunocompromised patients, but it does not typically cause cavitary lesions. Histoplasmosis can cause lung infections and cavitary lesions, but it is less common than TB in this context and the presentation is more consistent with TB.

Given the patient's symptoms, radiographic findings, and history of HIV with poor HAART compliance, M. tuberculosis is the most likely cause of his symptoms.",9
4244,"The clinical presentation of this patient is suggestive of a severe bacterial infection leading to septic shock. The key details include the presence of gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococci in the lung tissue, which is characteristic of Streptococcus pneumoniae. This organism is known to cause pneumonia, which can lead to sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), as seen in this patient. The interstitial infiltrates on the chest X-ray and the rapid progression to respiratory failure and hemodynamic collapse are consistent with a severe pneumococcal infection. The other organisms listed do not match the gram stain description: Staphylococcus aureus is gram-positive cocci in clusters, Neisseria meningitidis is gram-negative diplococci, and Haemophilus influenzae is a gram-negative coccobacillus. Therefore, the most likely organism causing this patient's condition is Streptococcus pneumoniae.",9
7831,"Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that acts as an estrogen antagonist in breast tissue, which is why it is used in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. However, in the endometrium, tamoxifen acts as an estrogen agonist. This agonistic effect on the endometrium can lead to endometrial hyperplasia and an increased risk of endometrial cancer. Therefore, while tamoxifen is beneficial for treating breast cancer, it does carry a risk of causing endometrial cancer due to its estrogenic effects on the uterine lining. The other options are not associated with tamoxifen: osteoporosis is not likely because tamoxifen has a protective effect on bone density, myelosuppression is not a known side effect of tamoxifen, and there is no established link between tamoxifen and ovarian cancer.",9
6818,"The scenario describes a woman who is experiencing infertility and is being treated with a drug that acts as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). The drug in question is likely clomiphene citrate, which is commonly used to induce ovulation in women with infertility issues. Clomiphene acts as an estrogen receptor antagonist in the hypothalamus, leading to increased release of gonadotropins (FSH and LH) and subsequent ovulation. However, it can also act as an estrogen receptor agonist in other tissues. One of the known adverse effects of clomiphene is visual disturbances, which can include blurred vision, scotomas, and other visual symptoms. These disturbances are thought to be due to the drug's effect on estrogen receptors in the visual pathways. The other options listed (deep venous thrombosis, osteoporosis, thrombophilia) are not commonly associated with clomiphene use. Therefore, the adverse event most likely associated with the drug prescribed in this scenario is visual disturbances.",9

7864,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings are indicative of bacterial meningitis. The CSF analysis shows high polymorphonuclear leukocytes, low glucose, and elevated protein, which are typical findings in bacterial meningitis. The gram stain reveals gram-positive lanceolate-shaped cocci in pairs, which is characteristic of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Additionally, the culture on blood agar shows alpha hemolysis and the colonies develop a 'draughtsman' appearance, both of which are consistent with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus) is more commonly associated with neonatal infections and would not typically present with these findings in a 6-year-old. Staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive cocci but typically forms clusters and is not alpha-hemolytic. Neisseria meningitidis is a gram-negative diplococcus, which does not match the gram-positive cocci seen in this case. Therefore, the most likely pathogen is Streptococcus pneumoniae.",10
6331,"The question describes a gunshot wound to the abdomen with the bullet lodged in a retroperitoneal structure. The retroperitoneal space contains certain parts of the gastrointestinal tract, among other structures. The descending colon is one of the parts of the colon that is retroperitoneal. The transverse colon and sigmoid colon are intraperitoneal, meaning they are not located in the retroperitoneal space. The ascending colon is also retroperitoneal. However, given the location of the entry wound in the left abdominal quadrant, the descending colon is the most likely structure to be affected, as it is located on the left side of the abdomen. Therefore, the bullet most likely penetrated the descending colon.",9
5271,"The patient's symptoms of progressive fatigue, weight loss, and intermittent diarrhea, along with the colonoscopy of the descending colon, suggest a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The tenderness in the lower quadrants and pale conjunctivae (suggesting anemia) also support this diagnosis. In IBD, two main types are considered: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

The options given include tests for different conditions:

- A positive lactose hydrogen breath test indicates lactose intolerance, which doesn't match the chronic systemic symptoms and colonoscopy findings.
- Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) are often associated with Crohn's disease.
- Perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA) are more commonly associated with ulcerative colitis.
- Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies are used to test for celiac disease, which typically presents with more upper gastrointestinal symptoms and wouldn't match the colonoscopic findings.

The location of the colonoscopy finding in the descending colon, along with the systemic symptoms, may suggest ulcerative colitis. However, further evaluation, specifically serological testing, in a case like this is more likely to show the presence of p-ANCA, which is associated with ulcerative colitis.",9
7892,"The scenario describes a situation where the senior resident receives negative feedback from an authority figure (the attending) and subsequently redirects his frustration towards a less threatening target (the medical student). This is a classic example of displacement, where an individual shifts their emotional response from the original source of stress to a safer or more convenient target. The resident is unable to express his frustration directly to the attending, so he unconsciously redirects it towards the medical student, who is in a subordinate position. This behavior does not fit the definitions of countertransference, externalization, or projection, as those involve different psychological processes.",9
5797,"To determine how many patients need to be treated with Noxbinle to prevent one death from HCC, we need to calculate the Number Needed to Treat (NNT). The NNT is calculated as the inverse of the absolute risk reduction (ARR). 

The ARR is the difference in the event rate between the control group (placebo or standard treatment) and the treatment group (Noxbinle). If the advertisement provides information such as the relative risk reduction or survival rates, we can use this to find the ARR.

Assuming the Noxbinle advertisement states an ARR of 10%, this means that treating 10 patients with Noxbinle prevents one additional death compared to the control group.

Thus, the NNT is 1 / ARR = 1 / 0.10 = 10. Therefore, 10 patients need to be treated with Noxbinle to prevent one death from HCC.",9
7894,"The patient initially presented with signs of infective endocarditis, likely due to his history of polysubstance abuse and homelessness, which predispose him to infections. He was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and underwent surgical intervention. After initial improvement, he developed a worsening fever and hemodynamic instability on day 6. Blood cultures are positive, indicating a bloodstream infection. Given that the femoral line was recently removed and the patient has a central line in place, the central line is a potential source of infection. Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) are common in ICU settings. The best next step is to remove the central line and send it for cultures to identify if it is the source of the infection. Peripheral IVs are less likely to be the source of a significant bloodstream infection compared to a central line. Therefore, the most appropriate management step is to remove the central line and send it for cultures.",9
6363,"The patient presents with acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, which are suggestive of an ischemic process in the bowel. Her history of postprandial abdominal pain relieved by nitroglycerin suggests chronic mesenteric ischemia, likely due to atherosclerosis. The recent percutaneous intervention for an inferior wall STEMI indicates she has significant cardiovascular disease, which could predispose her to acute mesenteric ischemia. The hypotension and tachycardia suggest shock, possibly leading to decreased perfusion of the bowel. The autopsy finding of a dark hemorrhagic appearance of the sigmoid colon is indicative of ischemic damage. Given the severity of her symptoms and the autopsy findings, a transmural infarction is the most likely pathology, as it involves full-thickness necrosis of the bowel wall, leading to severe complications and death.",9
5856,"The investigator's study shows an overall association between unemployment and suicide with an odds ratio of 3.02, indicating that unemployment is associated with a higher risk of suicide. However, when the data is stratified by psychiatric history, the association disappears in both groups (those with and without psychiatric history), as indicated by the non-significant p-values (p = 0.282 and p = 0.32, respectively). This suggests that the association observed in the overall analysis is not present when considering the subgroups separately. 

Effect modification occurs when the effect of the main exposure (unemployment) on the outcome (suicide) differs depending on the level of another variable (psychiatric history). However, in this case, the lack of association in both subgroups suggests that psychiatric history is not modifying the effect of unemployment on suicide.

Confounding occurs when the observed association is distorted by the presence of another variable that is related to both the exposure and the outcome. In this scenario, psychiatric history could be a confounder if it is associated with both unemployment and suicide, and its presence or absence changes the observed association.

The disappearance of the association in both subgroups suggests that the initial association might have been due to confounding by psychiatric history, which is a common risk factor for suicide and could be related to unemployment. Thus, the results are best explained by confounding.",9

7911,"The patient presents with abdominal distension, discomfort, and ascites. The peritoneal fluid analysis shows a cloudy appearance with a high triglyceride level (360 mg/dL), which is indicative of chylous ascites. Chylous ascites is often associated with lymphatic obstruction or leakage, which can be caused by conditions such as lymphoma. The lymphocytic predominance in the peritoneal fluid further supports a lymphatic or malignancy-related process. The patient's history of untreated hepatitis C and alcohol use raises the possibility of liver disease, but the normal liver enzyme levels and the specific findings in the peritoneal fluid point more towards a lymphatic issue rather than liver cirrhosis. Recent surgery is unlikely to cause chylous ascites, and the negative Gram stain makes bacterial infection less likely. Heart failure typically causes transudative ascites with low protein content, not chylous ascites. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is lymphoma.",9
6848,"The patient's symptoms of increasing shortness of breath and retrosternal chest pain on exertion, along with his history of smoking and hypertension, suggest a cardiovascular issue.

To determine the most likely cause of his auscultation findings, we need to consider common cardiac conditions associated with these symptoms:

1. **Left Ventricular Failure (A):** This condition, often due to ischemic heart disease or hypertension, can cause shortness of breath and exertional chest pain. Auscultation might reveal an S3 gallop, indicative of volume overload, or crackles in the lungs due to pulmonary congestion.

2. **Aortic Valve Sclerosis (B):** This condition involves thickening and calcification of the aortic valve without significant stenosis. It can cause a systolic ejection murmur but is less likely to cause significant symptoms unless it progresses to severe aortic stenosis.

3. **Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (C):** Often associated with chronic lung disease or pulmonary hypertension. It might cause a right-sided S4 or a parasternal heave.

4. **Mitral Valve Stenosis (D):** This condition causes a diastolic murmur and symptoms like shortness of breath due to pulmonary congestion. It is typically a result of rheumatic heart disease.

Given the patient's smoking history and hypertension, left ventricular failure due to ischemic heart disease or hypertensive heart disease is a likely scenario. The exertional chest pain and shortness of breath align with this diagnosis. The auscultation findings likely include an S3 gallop or evidence of pulmonary congestion, which are consistent with left ventricular failure.",9
6376,"The clinical presentation of the 15-year-old boy is suggestive of bacterial meningitis, characterized by fever, headache, neck stiffness, and positive Kernig's sign. The lumbar puncture and subsequent Gram stain revealing gram-negative diplococci strongly suggest Neisseria meningitidis as the causative organism. Neisseria meningitidis is known to grow on blood agar and Thayer-Martin medium, and it is oxidase-positive. Importantly, it ferments both glucose and maltose, which distinguishes it from Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which only ferments glucose. Therefore, the key identifying feature of Neisseria meningitidis in this context is its ability to ferment both glucose and maltose.",9

6387,"The infant is 5 days old and has lost some weight since birth, which is common in the first few days of life. Typically, newborns can lose up to 7-10% of their birth weight in the first week. This infant's weight loss is within the expected range. The infant is feeding every two hours for 30 minutes, which is a normal feeding pattern for a newborn. The mother reports that the infant urinates 6-8 times per day and has 3-4 stools per day, which are indicators of adequate hydration and nutrition. The stools are described as dark yellow and loose, which is typical for breastfed infants. The infant's vital signs are within normal limits, and there are no signs of dehydration or illness. Given these observations, the infant appears to be feeding adequately and is likely to regain birth weight soon. Therefore, the best management is to continue the current breastfeeding regimen without making any changes.",9
9975,"The clinical presentation and autopsy findings suggest that the patient suffered a pulmonary embolism (PE), which is a blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries in the lungs. This blockage is typically caused by blood clots that travel to the lungs from the deep veins in the legs or, less commonly, from other parts of the body. The most common source of such emboli is the deep veins of the lower extremities, particularly the deep veins of the thigh and pelvis. The iliac vein, which is a major vein in the pelvis, is a common site for the formation of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) that can lead to pulmonary embolism. The posterior tibial vein, while also a deep vein in the leg, is less commonly the source of large emboli that cause significant pulmonary embolism. The subclavian vein and renal vein are not typical sources for pulmonary emboli. Given the patient's recent travel, smoking history, and use of hormone replacement therapy, she was at increased risk for DVT, likely originating in the iliac vein, which then embolized to the pulmonary artery.",9
7425,"In this scenario, the physician is faced with a situation where a patient has a stab wound, which is a type of injury that is often required by law to be reported to the authorities. The patient is requesting confidentiality due to fear of retaliation from a rival gang. However, the physician must balance the ethical obligation to maintain patient confidentiality with the legal obligation to report certain types of injuries. In many jurisdictions, stab wounds are considered reportable injuries, meaning that healthcare providers are legally required to report them to law enforcement. This is because such injuries are often associated with criminal activity and public safety concerns. Therefore, despite the patient's request for confidentiality, the physician must comply with legal requirements and report the injury. This is not only a legal obligation but also a public safety measure. Thus, the correct course of action is to breach confidentiality and report the stab wound to the police.",9
5893,"The patient has atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of embolic events. The necrosis of the proximal portion of the greater curvature of the stomach suggests an embolic event in the arterial supply to that region. The greater curvature of the stomach is primarily supplied by the right and left gastroepiploic arteries. The left gastroepiploic artery is a branch of the splenic artery, which arises from the celiac trunk. An embolus originating from the heart in a patient with atrial fibrillation would likely travel through the aorta and could lodge in the splenic artery, leading to ischemia in the areas supplied by its branches, including the left gastroepiploic artery. Therefore, the embolus most likely passed through the splenic artery.",9
6931,"The patient presents with nephrotic syndrome (evidenced by significant proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperlipidemia) and nephritic syndrome features (hematuria with RBC casts). The echocardiography shows diastolic dysfunction with concentric ventricular thickening, which is suggestive of restrictive cardiomyopathy. The combination of nephrotic and nephritic syndrome, along with restrictive cardiomyopathy, points towards a systemic condition affecting multiple organs. AL amyloidosis is known to cause such a presentation due to the deposition of amyloid proteins in various tissues, including the kidneys and heart. The absence of osteolytic lesions on the skeletal survey makes multiple myeloma less likely, and the presence of RBC casts and significant proteinuria is not typical for Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia. Therefore, the best explanation for the findings is AL amyloidosis.",9
7902,"To solve this problem, we need to find out what proportion of the patients who developed type 2 diabetes mellitus on clozapine would not have developed it if they had been taking haloperidol instead. This can be determined using the concept of attributable risk or risk difference. \n\nFirst, calculate the incidence of diabetes in both groups:\n- Incidence in clozapine group = Number of cases / Total in clozapine group = 30/300 = 0.10 (10%).\n- Incidence in haloperidol group = Number of cases / Total in haloperidol group = 21/300 = 0.07 (7%).\n\nThe risk difference (attributable risk) is calculated as the difference in incidence rates between the two groups:\nAttributable risk = Incidence in clozapine group - Incidence in haloperidol group = 0.10 - 0.07 = 0.03 (3%).\n\nThus, 3% of the patients in the clozapine group developed diabetes specifically because they were on clozapine rather than haloperidol. Therefore, the proportion of patients on clozapine who would not have been diagnosed with diabetes if they had been on haloperidol is 3%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 0.03.",9
2838,"The patient is a 14-year-old boy presenting with symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder, including loss of appetite, sleeplessness, irritability, social withdrawal, and suicidal ideation. The most concerning aspect of this case is the patient's expressed intent to use his father's firearm to commit suicide. This indicates a high risk of imminent harm to himself, as he has a specific plan and access to means. In such situations, the priority is to ensure the safety of the patient. Involuntary hospitalization is warranted to provide immediate protection and stabilization, as well as to initiate treatment in a controlled environment. Informing the parents is also crucial, but the immediate step is to ensure the patient's safety through hospitalization. Options B, C, and D are inappropriate given the immediate risk of suicide.",9

6449,"The newborn in this scenario presents with several physical anomalies: low-set ears, flattened nasal tip, micrognathia (small and displaced backward jaw), and a clubfoot. These features are suggestive of a sequence of developmental abnormalities. The key to solving this question is recognizing the pattern of anomalies and linking them to a common underlying cause.

The combination of facial abnormalities (low-set ears, flattened nasal tip, micrognathia) and limb deformity (clubfoot) is characteristic of a condition known as Potter sequence. Potter sequence is primarily caused by oligohydramnios, which is a deficiency of amniotic fluid. Oligohydramnios can result from several conditions, but one of the most common causes is renal agenesis or obstruction of the urinary tract, such as posterior urethral valves in males.

Oligohydramnios leads to compression of the fetus, resulting in the characteristic facial features (Potter facies), limb deformities, and pulmonary hypoplasia due to lack of amniotic fluid for lung development.

Given the options, posterior urethral valve (option D) is a condition that can lead to oligohydramnios by causing urinary tract obstruction, leading to reduced urine output and thus reduced amniotic fluid. This fits the clinical picture presented in the question.

Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is posterior urethral valve, which leads to oligohydramnios and the associated sequence of anomalies.",9
3877,"The patient's symptoms are indicative of Parkinson's disease, characterized by a resting tremor, bradykinesia (slowness of movement), rigidity, and other non-motor symptoms such as decreased sense of smell and constipation. Parkinson's disease is primarily due to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to decreased dopamine levels in the brain. The treatment options for Parkinson's disease aim to increase dopamine levels or mimic its action. 

- Selegiline is a monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor that prevents the breakdown of dopamine, thereby increasing its availability but does not act directly on dopamine receptors.
- Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist, meaning it directly stimulates dopamine receptors, mimicking the action of dopamine.
- Carbidopa is used in combination with levodopa to prevent the peripheral breakdown of levodopa, allowing more to reach the brain, but it does not act directly on dopamine receptors.
- Benztropine is an anticholinergic that helps with tremor but does not act on dopamine receptors.

Since the question asks for a drug that acts directly on the receptors responsible for the condition, the correct answer is Bromocriptine, as it is a dopamine receptor agonist.",9
6978,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings provide several clues to the diagnosis. She has difficulty reading, which indicates a problem with vision. The key findings on examination are the pallor of the optic disc bilaterally and an increased cup-to-disk ratio (0.7 in the left eye and 0.9 in the right eye). A normal cup-to-disk ratio is around 0.3, so these findings suggest optic nerve damage. The sluggish reaction of the pupils to light also suggests an issue with the optic nerve. 

Age-related macular degeneration (A) typically affects central vision and would not cause optic disc pallor or an increased cup-to-disk ratio. Diabetic retinopathy (B) is characterized by changes in the retinal vasculature, such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and neovascularization, rather than optic disc pallor or increased cup-to-disk ratio. Optic neuritis (D) usually presents with sudden vision loss and pain on eye movement, and it typically affects younger individuals and is often unilateral.

Open-angle glaucoma (C) is characterized by progressive optic neuropathy with an increased cup-to-disk ratio due to loss of retinal ganglion cells and their axons. The bilateral optic disc pallor and increased cup-to-disk ratio are consistent with advanced open-angle glaucoma. The patient's age and the chronic nature of her symptoms also fit with this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is open-angle glaucoma.",9

5460,"The clinical scenario describes a patient who died from severe Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia and septic shock. The autopsy finding of a red, firm left lower lobe suggests that the lung is in the stage of red hepatization, which is a phase in the progression of lobar pneumonia. Lobar pneumonia typically progresses through four stages: congestion, red hepatization, gray hepatization, and resolution. During the red hepatization stage, the lung becomes firm and red due to the presence of exudate in the alveoli. This exudate is rich in neutrophils, erythrocytes, and fibrin, which gives the lung its characteristic red and firm appearance. Therefore, on microscopic examination, one would expect to find alveolar exudate containing neutrophils, erythrocytes, and fibrin, which corresponds to option D.",9
6998,"The clinical presentation of the 6-year-old boy suggests precocious puberty with signs of androgen excess, such as cystic acne, greasy skin, and early development of coarse axillary and pubic hair. The laboratory findings show low cortisol levels and elevated dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), which is an androgen precursor. The low cortisol level suggests an adrenal enzyme deficiency leading to impaired cortisol synthesis. 

The key enzyme deficiencies to consider in congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) are 21β-hydroxylase, 11β-hydroxylase, and 17α-hydroxylase. 

- 21β-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common cause of CAH and typically presents with low cortisol, low aldosterone, and high androgens, leading to virilization. However, it usually also causes elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone, which is not mentioned here.

- 11β-hydroxylase deficiency also leads to low cortisol and high androgens, but it typically causes hypertension due to accumulation of 11-deoxycorticosterone, a mineralocorticoid. This patient has a normal deoxycorticosterone level and no mention of hypertension.

- 17α-hydroxylase deficiency leads to low cortisol and low androgens, with high mineralocorticoids causing hypertension. This does not match the patient's presentation of androgen excess.

The elevated DHEA-S and low cortisol, along with the clinical signs of androgen excess, are consistent with 21β-hydroxylase deficiency, which is the most common cause of CAH and fits the clinical picture of early androgen excess without hypertension.",9
5480,"Huntington's disease is caused by an expansion of CAG repeats in the HTT gene. To determine if the siblings are carriers of the mutant allele, a test that can accurately measure the number of CAG repeats is needed. 

- **Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)** is a technique used to amplify DNA sequences, which is a preliminary step in many genetic tests but does not directly provide information about the number of repeats.

- **Gel electrophoresis** is a method used to separate DNA fragments based on size. When combined with PCR, it can be used to visualize the length of the CAG repeat region, thus providing evidence of whether the siblings have the expanded repeat associated with Huntington's disease.

- **Pyrosequencing** is a method of DNA sequencing that can provide detailed information about the sequence of nucleotides, but it is not typically used for repeat expansion disorders like Huntington's disease.

- **DNA isolation and purification** is a preparatory step to obtain DNA for further analysis, but it does not provide information about the presence of the mutant allele.

Given these options, gel electrophoresis following PCR amplification of the CAG repeat region is the best method to determine the presence of the expanded repeat associated with Huntington's disease.",9
8556,"The patient is presenting with hypothermia, which is an abnormally low body temperature. In the context of psychiatric medications, certain antipsychotics, particularly first-generation antipsychotics like fluphenazine, can impair the body's ability to regulate temperature. This is due to their effects on the hypothalamus, which is responsible for thermoregulation. Fluphenazine, a typical antipsychotic, is known to cause hypothermia as a side effect. The other medications listed, such as lithium, fluoxetine, and valproic acid, do not typically cause hypothermia. Lithium can cause thyroid dysfunction and renal issues, fluoxetine is an SSRI that can cause serotonin syndrome, and valproic acid is primarily associated with hepatotoxicity and teratogenic effects. Therefore, the medication most likely to exacerbate the patient's hypothermia is fluphenazine.",9
5487,"The question describes an enzyme located at the brush border of the duodenum that is responsible for converting trypsinogen to its active form, trypsin. This enzyme is known as enterokinase (also called enteropeptidase). Enterokinase activates trypsinogen by cleaving a specific peptide bond, which removes a small propeptide from the N-terminus of trypsinogen, thereby converting it into active trypsin. This process is a classic example of proteolytic activation, where an inactive precursor (zymogen) is activated by the cleavage of a specific peptide bond. Therefore, the underlying mechanism of this enzyme is the cleavage of a propeptide from an N-terminus.",10

7491,"The patient is a 42-year-old woman trying to conceive for the past 7 months without success. Her menstrual cycles are regular, suggesting regular ovulation, and she experiences mild vaginal dryness. Her husband has fathered children previously, making male factor infertility less likely. The patient's history includes a treated chlamydial infection, which can lead to tubal scarring as a potential cause of infertility. However, mild vaginal dryness and her age suggest a possibility of decreased ovarian reserve, which means the number and quality of her eggs may be reduced. This is common as women age, particularly over 40, and can lead to infertility despite regular cycles. While tubal scarring is possible due to her past infection, the more common issue in women over 40 is decreased ovarian reserve.",9
1397,"The patient presents with respiratory depression, pupillary constriction, and seizures, which are indicative of opioid overdose. The presence of fresh track marks on autopsy further supports the suspicion of opioid use. In cases of opioid overdose, the appropriate treatment is the administration of an opioid antagonist to reverse the effects of the opioid. Naloxone is a well-known opioid antagonist that can rapidly reverse the effects of opioid overdose, including respiratory depression. Methadone is used for opioid dependence treatment, not acute overdose. Flumazenil is used for benzodiazepine overdose, and bupropion is an antidepressant and smoking cessation aid, neither of which are appropriate for opioid overdose. Therefore, the correct medication to administer in this scenario is naloxone.",9
7532,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest he is experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized by anxiety, nightmares, and guilt related to his combat experiences. The primary symptoms include nightmares, avoidance, hyperarousal, and intrusive thoughts. For PTSD, the first-line treatment options include trauma-focused psychotherapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and medications like SSRIs or SNRIs.

In this scenario, the patient is experiencing significant distress and functional impairment due to his symptoms, particularly the nightmares and guilt. While prazosin is specifically used to address nightmares associated with PTSD, it does not address the full spectrum of PTSD symptoms. Venlafaxine, an SNRI, is effective for treating PTSD, addressing both anxiety and depressive symptoms. However, the question asks for the most appropriate initial step in treatment, and trauma-focused CBT is a well-established first-line treatment for PTSD, addressing the cognitive and behavioral aspects of the disorder. It helps the patient process the trauma and restructure negative thoughts, which is crucial for recovery.

Motivational interviewing is not typically used as a primary treatment for PTSD. Therefore, the most appropriate initial step in treatment for this patient is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which directly targets the core symptoms of PTSD.",9
5504,"The patient's arterial blood gas results show a pH of 7.51, indicating alkalosis, and a pCO2 of 30 mm Hg, which is lower than normal, suggesting respiratory alkalosis. This condition occurs when there is excessive ventilation leading to a decrease in carbon dioxide levels. The symptoms of severe dyspnea and dizziness, along with the sudden onset of symptoms, are consistent with hyperventilation. Among the options provided, a panic attack is the most likely cause of acute hyperventilation leading to respiratory alkalosis. Opioid toxicity typically causes respiratory depression and respiratory acidosis, not alkalosis. Myasthenia gravis can cause respiratory muscle weakness, leading to respiratory acidosis due to hypoventilation. Epiglottitis can cause airway obstruction, but it would not typically cause respiratory alkalosis. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms and blood gas findings is a panic attack.",9
7041,"The patient's symptoms and biopsy findings are indicative of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The recurrent retrosternal chest pain that wakes her up at night is a classic symptom of GERD. The endoscopic finding of hyperemia in the distal esophagus and the biopsy showing non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium with basal cell hyperplasia and neutrophilic infiltrates are consistent with reflux esophagitis. GERD is typically caused by decreased lower esophageal sphincter (LES) tone, which allows gastric contents to reflux into the esophagus. However, the question asks for the underlying cause of the findings, which in this case is the proximal migration of the gastroesophageal junction, commonly seen in a hiatal hernia. This anatomical change can lead to decreased LES tone and increased reflux, causing the observed esophageal changes.",9

7056,"The patient has been diagnosed with a provoked deep venous thrombosis (DVT) following surgery, which is a common complication after orthopedic procedures like knee arthroplasty. The standard initial treatment for DVT involves anticoagulation to prevent clot propagation and reduce the risk of pulmonary embolism. 

Oral anticoagulants such as direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are commonly used for the treatment of DVT. Among the options provided, oral apixaban monotherapy is a DOAC that is approved for the treatment of DVT and can be used as monotherapy without the need for initial parenteral anticoagulation. 

Dabigatran, another DOAC, typically requires initial parenteral anticoagulation before starting oral therapy, so it is not the best initial monotherapy option. Aspirin is not recommended as the primary treatment for acute DVT. Complete bed rest is not advised as it can increase the risk of further thrombosis and is not a treatment for DVT.

Therefore, the best initial therapy for this patient is oral apixaban monotherapy.",9
7552,"In statistics, outliers are extreme values that differ significantly from other observations in the data set. Measures of central tendency like the mean, median, and mode, as well as measures of variability like standard deviation, can be affected by outliers to varying degrees.

- **Mean**: The mean is the average of all data points. It is highly sensitive to outliers because it takes into account every value in the data set. An outlier will skew the mean significantly.

- **Median**: The median is the middle number in a sorted, ascending or descending, list of numbers. It is less sensitive to outliers because it depends only on the order of the numbers, not their specific values. If an outlier is present, it does not affect the median unless it changes the middle position of the data set.

- **Mode**: The mode is the number that occurs most frequently. It is not affected by outliers at all unless the outlier value itself is the most frequent value, which generally does not happen with typical outliers.

- **Standard deviation**: This measure of spread is also sensitive to outliers because it is based on the average square deviation from the mean, and since the mean is affected by outliers, the standard deviation will also be inflated by them.

Given the options, the statistic that is least sensitive to outliers is the mode, as it is not reliant on the magnitude of the data values but rather on frequency.

Thus, the least sensitive statistic to outliers is the mode.",9

7096,"The patient's symptoms and family history are suggestive of Huntington's disease. The key features include cognitive decline, mood disturbances, and chorea (uncontrollable movements). The fact that her father died at age 45 from a movement disorder further supports this diagnosis, as Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder that typically presents in mid-adulthood. The pathological hallmark of Huntington's disease is the loss of neurons in the caudate nucleus and putamen, which are parts of the basal ganglia. This neuronal loss leads to the characteristic symptoms of the disease. The other options are associated with different conditions: Alpha-synuclein intracellular inclusions are seen in Parkinson's disease, lipohyalinosis is associated with small vessel disease in the brain, and beta-amyloid plaques are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.",10

5576,"The clinical presentation of this patient is suggestive of Cushing's syndrome, characterized by symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, weight loss, hypertension, purple striae, hirsutism, buffalo hump, central obesity, and muscle weakness. The presence of an adrenal mass with para-aortic lymphadenopathy on ultrasound suggests an adrenal source of excess cortisol production, likely an adrenal adenoma or carcinoma. In cases of adrenal-origin Cushing's syndrome, the adrenal gland autonomously secretes cortisol, leading to elevated serum cortisol levels. This results in suppressed ACTH levels due to negative feedback on the pituitary gland. Additionally, the elevated cortisol levels would cause impaired glucose tolerance and increased 24-hour urinary free cortisol. Therefore, the most likely laboratory profile for this patient would be impaired glucose tolerance, elevated serum cortisol, elevated 24-hour urinary free cortisol, and low plasma ACTH, which corresponds to option C.",9
7634,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a condition characterized by the pentad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (evidenced by schistocytes on the blood smear), thrombocytopenia, renal impairment, neurological symptoms, and fever. The normal PT and aPTT, along with normal fibrinogen and D-dimer levels, help differentiate TTP from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The standard and most effective treatment for TTP is plasma exchange, which helps remove the inhibitory antibodies against ADAMTS13 and replenishes the deficient enzyme, thereby reducing the formation of microthrombi. Other options like renal dialysis, intravenous immunoglobulin, and rehydration do not address the underlying pathophysiology of TTP.",9
7133,"The patient presents with microcytic anemia (low hemoglobin and low MCV) and has elevated serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation. These findings are inconsistent with iron deficiency anemia, which typically shows low serum iron, low ferritin, and high TIBC. Anemia of chronic disease usually presents with low serum iron and normal or increased ferritin, which does not match this patient's profile. Hemochromatosis typically presents with iron overload but not with microcytic anemia. Myelodysplastic syndrome can present with macrocytic or normocytic anemia, not microcytic. Sideroblastic anemia, however, is characterized by microcytic anemia with increased serum iron and ferritin, and often a family history of anemia, which fits this patient's presentation. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is sideroblastic anemia.",9
7660,"The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of an acute aortic dissection. Key findings include the sudden onset of severe, tearing chest pain radiating to the jaw, differential blood pressure in the arms, and widened mediastinum on chest x-ray. Aortic dissection can lead to several complications, including rupture into the pleural space, pericardial space, or esophagus. 

- Option A (Tactile crepitus over the neck) suggests subcutaneous emphysema, which is not directly related to aortic dissection.
- Option B (Muffled heart sounds) suggests cardiac tamponade, which can occur if the dissection ruptures into the pericardial space, leading to Beck's triad (hypotension, muffled heart sounds, and jugular venous distension).
- Option C (Early diastolic knocking sound) suggests a pericardial knock, which is associated with constrictive pericarditis, not aortic dissection.
- Option D (Diminished breath sounds over the right lung base) suggests a pleural effusion or hemothorax, which can occur if the dissection ruptures into the pleural space.

Given the scenario, the most likely complication of an aortic dissection is cardiac tamponade due to rupture into the pericardial space, leading to muffled heart sounds.",9

7679,"The clinical presentation of the patient is suggestive of an inflammatory myopathy, characterized by progressive proximal muscle weakness, difficulty with tasks like climbing stairs and brushing hair, and elevated creatine kinase levels. The muscle biopsy findings are crucial for distinguishing between different types of inflammatory myopathies.

- **Option A** describes muscle fiber necrosis with rare inflammatory cells, which is more indicative of muscular dystrophies rather than inflammatory myopathies.

- **Option B** describes sarcolemmal MHC-I overexpression with CD8+ lymphocytic infiltration, which is characteristic of polymyositis. In polymyositis, there is endomysial inflammation with CD8+ T cells attacking muscle fibers.

- **Option C** describes relative atrophy of type II muscle fibers with hypertrophy of type I muscle fibers, which is typically seen in chronic steroid myopathy or disuse atrophy, not in inflammatory myopathies.

- **Option D** describes perimysial inflammation with perivascular CD4+ T lymphocytic infiltration, which is characteristic of dermatomyositis. Dermatomyositis involves perimysial and perivascular inflammation with CD4+ T cells and is often associated with skin changes, although skin findings are not mentioned in this case.

Given the options and the presentation, the most likely diagnosis is polymyositis due to the proximal muscle weakness and elevated creatine kinase levels, with the histological finding described in option B being the most characteristic of this condition.",9
5605,"The patient presents with symptoms characteristic of essential tremor, which is a familial condition that typically manifests as a bilateral action tremor (postural tremor) that worsens with movement and improves with alcohol consumption. The familial nature and the fact that the tremor worsens during activities like the finger-to-nose test support this diagnosis. 

The most commonly used medications for essential tremor are propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, and primidone, an anticonvulsant. Both medications are effective in reducing the amplitude of the tremor. Given that the patient has a history of bronchial asthma, propranolol should be avoided as it can exacerbate asthma symptoms. In such cases, primidone is often the preferred treatment option as it does not have the same respiratory side effects.

Based on the symptomatology, family history, and pharmacological considerations, primidone is the most appropriate choice for this patient.",9

9707,"The patient's symptoms include progressive memory loss, difficulty with daily activities such as dressing and navigation, and episodes of jerky, repetitive movements. These symptoms are suggestive of a rapidly progressive dementia. The presence of myoclonus (jerky movements) is particularly indicative of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a prion disease. CJD is characterized by rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus, and other neurological symptoms. The absence of family history and the rapid progression over 5 months further support this diagnosis. The underlying cause of CJD is the accumulation of abnormal prion proteins in the brain, leading to neurodegeneration. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is mutant prion accumulation.",9
